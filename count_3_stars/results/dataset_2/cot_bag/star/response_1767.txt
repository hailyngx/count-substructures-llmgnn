Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 11) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 13, 10, 11, 7, 12, 0, 14, 3, 4, 2, and 1. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of \(10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 78\) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [78].

And the unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (3, 8, 14)>, <9, (0, 1, 10)>, <8, (1, 12, 10)>, <13, (2, 6, 3)>, <10, (8, 14, 4)>, <11, (3, 9, 13)>, <12, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <14, (0, 10, 6)>, <3, (6, 11, 13)>, <4, (0, 5, 10)>, <2, (12, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>.
