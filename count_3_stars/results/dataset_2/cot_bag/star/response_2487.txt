Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (16, 4) (16, 6) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 13) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 16) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
In this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 1 neighbor
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2, (6, 18, 14)>, <2, (6, 18, 1)>, <2, (6, 18, 12)>, <2, (6, 14, 13)>, <2, (18, 14, 19)>, <2, (18, 14, 13)>, <2, (18, 1, 10)>, <2, (18, 1, 12)>, <2, (18, 12, 19)>, <2, (14, 13, 10)>

- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <4, (16, 9, 5)>, <4, (16, 9, 0)>, <4, (16, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>

- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <6, (0, 16, 4)>, <6, (0, 16, 2)>, <6, (0, 18, 2)>, <6, (16, 2, 18)>

- For Node 8: 1
  <8, (10, 19, 12)>

- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (13, 14, 2)>, <10, (13, 14, 19)>, <10, (13, 1, 18)>, <10, (14, 19, 18)>

- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <12, (11, 18, 19)>, <12, (11, 18, 8)>, <12, (11, 19, 8)>, <12, (18, 19, 8)>

- For Node 14: 1
  <14, (2, 13, 10)>

- For Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <18, (2, 6, 0)>, <18, (2, 6, 16)>, <18, (2, 6, 16)>, <18, (2, 6, 16)>, <18, (2, 0, 7)>, <18, (6, 0, 7)>, <18, (6, 0, 16)>, <18, (6, 16, 4)>, <18, (0, 7, 9)>, <18, (6, 7, 9)>

- For Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <19, (8, 12, 14)>, <19, (8, 12, 1)>, <19, (8, 12, 18)>, <19, (8, 14, 13)>, <19, (12, 14, 13)>, <19, (12, 1, 10)>, <19, (12, 18, 1)>, <19, (12, 18, 14)>, <19, (14, 13, 10)>, <19, (1, 18, 6)>

So the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 48. 

Therefore, the final answer is [48].
