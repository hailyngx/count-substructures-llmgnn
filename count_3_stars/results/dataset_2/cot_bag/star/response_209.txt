Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (1, 14) (1, 17) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 10) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the number of 3-stars around those nodes.

Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 (neighbors: 16, 6, 8, 19, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 3, 5, 12, 10)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 16, 18, 4, 10)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 10, 18, 2)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 6, 5, 4, 13)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 16, 14, 0, 12)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 11, 17, 19, 4)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 16, 3, 10)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 11, 17, 0, 1, 7)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 13, 2, 5)

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from these nodes: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 36 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <4, 3, 5>
- <4, 5, 10>
- <4, 10, 13>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <6, 10, 13>
- <11, 14, 0>
- <11, 14, 7>
- <11, 16, 13>
- <11, 16, 5>
- <12, 11, 17>
- <12, 17, 19>
- <12, 19, 4>
- <14, 1, 7>
- <16, 11, 14>
- <16, 13, 10>
- <16, 5, 10>
- <2, 16, 6>
- <5, 16, 13>
- <2, 6, 18>
- <4, 12, 19>
- <14, 0, 1>
- <17, 1, 14>
- <17, 9, 12>
