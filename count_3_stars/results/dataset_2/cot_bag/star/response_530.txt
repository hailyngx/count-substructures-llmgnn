Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph by using the given method:

For Node 3 (degree 5):
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 possible 3-stars with Node 3 as the center. 
Unique 3-stars with Node 3:
<3, (5, 6, 9)> <3, (4, 5, 6)> <3, (1, 4, 6)> <3, (0, 1, 3)> <3, (0, 4, 9)> <3, (0, 5, 9)> <3, (1, 4, 6)> <3, (1, 4, 6)> <3, (3, 5, 9)> <3, (3, 6, 9)>

For Node 4 (degree 6):
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
So, there are 20 possible 3-stars with Node 4 as the center. 
Unique 3-stars with Node 4:
<4, (5, 3, 6)> <4, (5, 6, 9)> <4, (3, 6, 9)> <4, (3, 5, 9)> <4, (0, 5, 9)> <4, (0, 1, 3)> <4, (0, 1, 6)> <4, (0, 1, 9)> <4, (0, 6, 9)> <4, (1, 3, 6)> <4, (1, 3, 9)> <4, (1, 6, 9)> <4, (2, 6, 9)> <4, (2, 4, 6)> <4, (2, 4, 9)> <4, (2, 4, 0)> <4, (8, 5, 0)> <4, (8, 5, 4)> <4, (8, 0, 2)> <4, (8, 0, 5)>

Add the total number of 3-stars found: [10 + 20 = 30]
