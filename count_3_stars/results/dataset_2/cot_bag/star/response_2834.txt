Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 1) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these, we get a total of 100 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [100].

For the unique 3-stars:
- Node 1: <1, (7, 14, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 8)> <2, (4, 10, 14)> <2, (6, 8, 11)> <2, (6, 10, 1)> <2, (8, 12, 14)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 5, 2)> <4, (7, 13, 12)> <4, (5, 13, 3)> <4, (2, 6, 8)> <4, (2, 6, 14)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 13)>
- Node 6: <6, (4, 2, 11)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 13)> <7, (4, 6, 2)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 2, 14)>
- Node 11: <11, (6, 0, 13)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 8, 14)> <12, (7, 13, 10)>
- Node 13: <13, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 14: <14, (2, 1, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
