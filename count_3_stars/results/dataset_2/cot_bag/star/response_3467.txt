Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) 

Response:
We need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: (5, 7, 8, 13)
- Node 1: (16, 4, 3, 2)
- Node 2: (11, 1, 14)
- Node 3: (1, 17, 12, 8)
- Node 4: (11, 7, 12, 1)
- Node 6: (13, 17, 15, 18)
- Node 8: (3, 10, 0)
- Node 10: (8, 17, 12)
- Node 11: (19, 4, 2)
- Node 12: (4, 3, 13, 10)
- Node 13: (12, 15, 0, 6)
- Node 15: (13, 6, 18)
- Node 16: (1, 19)
- Node 17: (3, 10, 6)
- Node 18: (5, 6, 15)
- Node 19: (11, 16)

From the list, we see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

List of unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (5, 7, 8, 13)>
- <1, (16, 4, 3, 2)>
- <2, (11, 14, 1)>
- <4, (11, 7, 12, 1)>
- <6, (13, 17, 15, 18)>
