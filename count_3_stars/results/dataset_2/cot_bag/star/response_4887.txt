Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 27) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 22) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 10) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 15) (7, 23) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 28) (12, 21) (12, 14) (12, 27) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 20) (25, 17) (25, 4) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 2) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 5) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 29) (8, 1) (8, 17) (28, 9) (28, 5) (11, 21) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 28) (5, 24) (13, 7) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 0) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 2) (24, 1) (24, 4) (24, 5) (20, 6) (20, 19) (20, 26) (20, 3) (2, 25) (2, 3) (29, 16) (29, 19) (29, 26) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 21, 14, 17, 0, 27, 4, 9, 12, 10, 15, 16, 25, 23, 5, 22, 20, 3, 24, 29.

Therefore, there are 20 nodes that can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 47\)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (27, 8, 21)>, <5, (28, 23, 20)>, <12, (27, 14, 21)>, <14, (17, 12, 22)>, <15, (9, 10, 4)>, <16, (0, 25, 29)>, <20, (3, 26, 19)>, <22, (0, 14, 17)>, <23, (7, 16, 10)>, <24, (4, 1, 5)>.
