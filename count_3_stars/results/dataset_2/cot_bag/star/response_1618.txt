Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 16) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 16) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 19.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 35 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 18, 19)>, <5, (9, 14, 19)>, <11, (10, 7, 8)>, <12, (5, 19, 6)>, <13, (10, 16, 19)>, <16, (13, 4, 7)>, <19, (5, 2, 12)>.
