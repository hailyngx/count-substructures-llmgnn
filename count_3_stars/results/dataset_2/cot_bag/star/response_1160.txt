Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 3, 10, 11, 8, 13, 4, 5, 0, 14, 7, and 2.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 63 \).

Therefore, there are 63 3-stars in this graph: 

\[ [63] \]
