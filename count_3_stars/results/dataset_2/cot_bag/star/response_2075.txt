Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 8, 13, 5, 6, 2, 12, 0, 3, 11, 10, 9, and 1.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (8, 9, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 11)>

- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (4, 8, 10)>, <7, (4, 9, 12)>, <7, (4, 11, 6)>, <7, (8, 12, 5)>, <7, (8, 13, 1)>, <7, (8, 6, 5)>, <7, (6, 5, 11)>, <7, (6, 3, 12)>, <7, (10, 6, 3)>, <7, (10, 4, 8)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (4, 7, 13)>, <8, (4, 9, 10)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>, <8, (13, 1, 2)>, <8, (13, 1, 14)>, <8, (13, 5, 1)>, <8, (13, 5, 14)>, <8, (13, 1, 5)>, <8, (13, 2, 1)>, <8, (13, 2, 14)>, <8, (13, 14, 1)>, <8, (13, 14, 5)>, <8, (13, 14, 2)>, <8, (8, 5, 2)>, <8, (8, 5, 1)>, <8, (8, 1, 2)>, <8, (8, 1, 14)>, <8, (8, 1, 5)>, <8, (8, 2, 14)>, <8, (8, 2, 5)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (7, 5, 3)>, <6, (5, 10, 3)>, <6, (5, 11, 3)>, <6, (5, 12, 3)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (8, 5, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 13)>, <2, (5, 3, 12)>, <2, (3, 9, 0)>

- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <12, (7, 5, 9)>, <12, (9, 3, 0)>, <12, (5, 11, 9)>, <12, (5, 6, 3)>

  - <3, (13, 5, 2)>, <3, (13, 5, 1)>, <3, (13, 2, 1)>, <3, (13, 2, 14)>, <3, (13, 1, 14)>, <3, (13, 1, 5)>, <3, (9, 6, 11)>, <3, (9, 11, 5)>, <3, (6, 5, 11)>, <3, (9, 12, 0)>

- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (5, 7, 9)>, <11, (5, 7, 12)>, <11, (9, 7, 12)>, <11, (6, 5, 3)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 92 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [92].
