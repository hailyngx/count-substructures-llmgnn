Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 9) + 10 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 2) = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>.
