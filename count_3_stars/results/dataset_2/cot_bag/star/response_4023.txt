Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} \]  

\[ = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 \]  

\[ = 84 \]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:  
<1, 7, 12>  
<2, 1, 7>  
<2, 7, 10>  
<2, 14, 10>  
<3, 7, 12>  
<3, 11, 0>
