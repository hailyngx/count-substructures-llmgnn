Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 11, 5
- Node 1: 10
- Node 2: 6, 8, 13, 12, 11
- Node 3: 4, 11, 14
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8, 13, 3
- Node 5: 7, 8, 0
- Node 6: 9, 2, 8, 4, 0
- Node 7: 9, 4, 14, 5
- Node 8: 6, 4, 13, 2, 5
- Node 9: 6, 10, 7, 12
- Node 10: 9, 0, 14, 1
- Node 11: 2, 3, 0, 12
- Node 12: 9, 13, 2, 11, 0
- Node 13: 4, 8, 12, 2
- Node 14: 7, 3, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

There are a total of 55 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:
\[ [55] \]
And the unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, (6, 11, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 7)>, <12, (9, 13, 2)>, <2, (11, 3, 0)>, <0, (10, 14, 1)> \]
