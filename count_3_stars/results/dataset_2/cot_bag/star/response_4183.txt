Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
2: 0, 4, 5, 8
3: 7, 8
4: 0, 2, 6, 9, 1
5: 0, 1, 2, 6
6: 4, 5
7: 1, 3, 8, 9
8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
9: 0, 1, 4, 7

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each eligible node:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [56] \)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
