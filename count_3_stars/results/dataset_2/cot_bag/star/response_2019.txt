Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 22) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 29) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 18) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 25) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 11) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 11) (28, 6) (28, 0) (6, 14) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 11) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 6) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 29) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 19) (22, 15) (22, 16) (22, 25) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 13) (0, 21) (0, 28) (24, 9) (24, 27) (24, 8) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 22) (13, 3) (13, 29) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (3, 8, 19)>
<2, (3, 19, 20)>
<2, (8, 19, 20)>
<2, (19, 20, 18)>

Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
<3, (2, 8, 19)>
<3, (2, 8, 20)>
<3, (2, 19, 20)>
<3, (8, 19, 20)>

Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (10, 11, 28)>
<6, (10, 11, 6)>
<6, (10, 11, 23)>
<6, (11, 23, 28)>

Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
<7, (9, 4, 29)>

Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
<10, (5, 1, 6)>

Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<11, (6, 17, 23)>
<11, (6, 21, 23)>
<11, (6, 23, 28)>
<11, (6, 23, 29)>
<11, (17, 21, 23)>
<11, (17, 6, 21)>
<11, (17, 6, 28)>
<11, (17, 6, 29)>
<11, (21, 23, 26)>
<11, (21, 6, 26)>

Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
<12, (4, 16, 18)>

Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<14, (17, 1, 20)>

Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
<15, (20, 22, 25)>

Node 18 can form 1 3-star.
<18, (19, 20, 27)>

Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<20, (14, 15, 18)>
<20, (14, 15, 19)>
<20, (14, 18, 19)>
<20, (15, 18, 19)>
<20, (18, 19, 27)>
<20, (18, 19, 20)>
<20, (18, 19, 25)>
<20, (18, 19, 22)>
<20, (19, 22, 25)>
<20, (19, 22, 18)>

Node 21 can form 1 3-star.
<21, (0, 11, 26)>

Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<22, (15, 16, 25)>

Node 24 can form 1 3-star.
<24, (9, 27, 8)>

Node 25 can form 1 3-star.
<25, (1, 22, 8)>

Node 26 can form 1 3-star.
<26, (11, 21, 23)>

Node 27 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
<27, (18, 24, 19)>

Node 29 can form 1 3-star.
<29, (7, 13, 23)>

Since we have found all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 32.  
Therefore, the final answer is [32].
