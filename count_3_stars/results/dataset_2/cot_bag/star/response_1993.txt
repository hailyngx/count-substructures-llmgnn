Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 27) (16, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 26) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 24) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (20, 13) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 2) (25, 20) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 5) (28, 18) (28, 4) (28, 2) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 5) (24, 13) (24, 9) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 19) (29, 27) (29, 20) (29, 15) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 29) (9, 10) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 19) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 4) (2, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the degrees of the nodes by counting how many edges are incident to each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 1
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 4
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Node 25 has degree 2
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 2
- Node 29 has degree 3

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 1, 9)> 
<2, (20, 2, 29)> 
<4, (28, 4, 2)> 
<5, (8, 5, 1)> 
<7, (15, 7, 29)> 
<9, (24, 9, 1)> 
<13, (24, 13, 9)> 
<19, (6, 19, 9)> 
<19, (3, 19, 9)> 
<20, (25, 20, 29)>
<21, (14, 21, 23)>
<26, (22, 26, 5)>
