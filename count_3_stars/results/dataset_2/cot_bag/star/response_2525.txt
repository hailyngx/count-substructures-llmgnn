Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 18) (27, 28) (27, 5) (1, 22) (3, 18) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 11) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 23) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 7) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 1) (22, 20) (22, 7) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 24) (11, 20) (11, 23) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 16) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 0) (29, 25) (14, 5) (14, 9) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 19) (25, 17) (25, 29) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 15) (18, 3) (16, 9) (16, 23) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 24) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 2) (24, 4) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (7, 26) (7, 22) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

We first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

\[ <0, (17, 29, 6)>, <5, (27, 6, 20)>, <6, (5, 29, 0)>, <8, (21, 28, 5)>, <10, (17, 26, 13)>, <12, (0, 8, 19)>, <13, (26, 4, 23)>, <17, (10, 4, 0)>, <19, (21, 12, 28)>, <20, (15, 22, 24)> \]

Putting this final count inside brackets, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
