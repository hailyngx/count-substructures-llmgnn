Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 15) (17, 0) (17, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 11) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
1. For node 0: There are 4 neighbors (1, 17, 18, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. For node 4: There are 3 neighbors (7, 16, 11), so there is 1 3-star.
3. For node 6: There are 3 neighbors (9, 7, 8), so there is 1 3-star.
4. For node 8: There are 4 neighbors (19, 16, 11, 6), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. For node 9: There are 4 neighbors (6, 18, 14, 5), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. For node 11: There are 5 neighbors (14, 13, 8, 4, 2), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. For node 14: There are 4 neighbors (10, 19, 9, 11), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. For node 15: There are 3 neighbors (12, 7, 10), so there is 1 3-star.
9. For node 16: There are 4 neighbors (12, 4, 3, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. For node 18: There are 4 neighbors (0, 19, 17, 5), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. For node 19: There are 4 neighbors (18, 14, 8, 19), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 37 3-stars, which can be represented inside brackets as [37].
