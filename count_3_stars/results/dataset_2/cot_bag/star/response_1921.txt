Let's now determine the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 10, 11, 17, 15, 18, 14, 9, 3, 5, 19, 16, 8, 0, 2, 4

Calculating inom{n}{3} for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 11: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 14: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<10, (11, 14, 17)>, <17, (10, 18, 8)>, <15, (6, 11, 7)>, <18, (0, 3, 19)>, <18, (0, 9, 2)>, <18, (3, 17, 19)>, <18, (3, 9, 2)>, <18, (0, 19, 9)>, <9, (0, 12, 2)>, <3, (7, 12, 18)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <19, (0, 13, 18)>, <16, (2, 6, 15)>, <8, (7, 12, 17)>, <0, (4, 5, 18)>, <2, (5, 9, 16)>, <4, (0, 5, 19)>
