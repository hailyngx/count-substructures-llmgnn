Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 1, 3}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 1}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <1, (9, 3, 6)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>

For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>

For Node 7, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, 
<7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>

Calculating the total, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 20] = 34 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are <1, (9, 3, 6)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>.
