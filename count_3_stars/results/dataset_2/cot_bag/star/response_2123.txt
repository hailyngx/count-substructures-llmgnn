Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: There are 4 neighbors of node 0 (4, 7, 8, 3). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

2. Node 2: There are 4 neighbors of node 2 (8, 3, 1, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

3. Node 3: There are 4 neighbors of node 3 (7, 2, 0, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

4. Node 4: There are 6 neighbors of node 4 (7, 8, 0, 11, 6, 4). So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

5. Node 5: There are 4 neighbors of node 5 (10, 13, 12, 14). So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

6. Node 6: There are 5 neighbors of node 6 (4, 11, 3, 13, 12). So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

7. Node 7: There are 4 neighbors of node 7 (4, 0, 10, 3). So, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

8. Node 8: There are 4 neighbors of node 8 (4, 2, 0, 1). So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

9. Node 10: There are 5 neighbors of node 10 (7, 11, 0, 13, 5). So, the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

10. Node 11: There are 5 neighbors of node 11 (4, 10, 14, 6, 11). So, the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

11. Node 12: There are 4 neighbors of node 12 (5, 13, 14, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

12. Node 13: There are 4 neighbors of node 13 (10, 5, 12, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

13. Node 14: There are 3 neighbors of node 14 (11, 5, 12). So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 79\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [79]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<2, (8, 3, 1)>
<3, (7, 2, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 11)>
<5, (13, 12, 14)>
<6, (13, 12, 5)>
<7, (10, 0, 3)>
<8, (2, 1, 9)>
<10, (11, 14, 5)>
<11, (14, 6, 11)>
