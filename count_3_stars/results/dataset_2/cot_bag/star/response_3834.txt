Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph described with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We will now count the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

- Node 0: 4 neighbors 
- Node 1: 5 neighbors 
- Node 2: 4 neighbors 
- Node 3: 3 neighbors 
- Node 4: 3 neighbors 
- Node 5: 5 neighbors 
- Node 6: 4 neighbors 
- Node 7: 5 neighbors 
- Node 8: 3 neighbors  
- Node 11: 5 neighbors 
- Node 12: 5 neighbors 
- Node 13: 4 neighbors 
- Node 14: 5 neighbors 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 0 + 0 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 0 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} ] = [ 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 ] = [ 76 ] \]

Therefore, there are 76 total 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list them out:

\[ <0, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 13)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <11, (1, 9, 14)>, <12, (7, 0, 6)>, <13, (2, 6, 14)>, <14, (6, 11, 13)> \]
