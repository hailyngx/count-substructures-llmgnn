Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 14) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 10
- Node 2: 9, 1, 7, 11
- Node 3: 9, 6, 12, 11, 10
- Node 4: 6, 13, 0
- Node 7: 2, 12, 0, 14, 1
- Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 11, 3
- Node 10: 12, 13, 3, 1, 14
- Node 11: 9, 2, 12, 3, 0
- Node 12: 7, 13, 10, 11, 3, 1
- Node 13: 12, 4, 10
- Node 14: 8, 7, 10

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <1, (2, 7, 12)>
  - <1, (2, 10, 14)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (9, 11, 3)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (9, 12, 10)>
- Node 6: No 3-star formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (2, 12, 1)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (2, 11, 3)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <10, (12, 13, 1)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <11, (2, 12, 3)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <12, (7, 13, 10)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <13, (12, 4, 10)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <14, (8, 7, 10)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 86 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].
