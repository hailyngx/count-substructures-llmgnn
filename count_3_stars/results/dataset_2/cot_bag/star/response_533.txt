Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 11, 16, 3, 15, 1, 2, 18, 5, and 19. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these results, we get a total of 47 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [47]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
