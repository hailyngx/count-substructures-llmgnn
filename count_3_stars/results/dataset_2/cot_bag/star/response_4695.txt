Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 23) (6, 16) (9, 1) (9, 22) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 24) (8, 27) (23, 21) (23, 25) (23, 29) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 11) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 24) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (26, 18) (26, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 7) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (18, 26) (18, 15) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 7) (10, 20) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 13) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 28) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 17) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 16) (14, 25) (14, 5) (14, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 4) (27, 8) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 2) (28, 27) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 27) 

Response:
There are three nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 9, and 24. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- For node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. This contributes 1 3-star to the total.

- For node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars. This contributes 4 3-stars to the total.

- For node 24: There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars. This contributes 4 3-stars to the total.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. 

Putting this inside brackets [] gives us [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 11, 9>
- <9, 12, 17>
- <9, 22, 25>
- <9, 22, 24>
- <24, 3, 8>
- <24, 8, 17>
- <24, 17, 22>
- <24, 22, 25>
- <24, 22, 11>
