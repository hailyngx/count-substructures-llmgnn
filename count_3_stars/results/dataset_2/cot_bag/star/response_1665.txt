Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
