Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (11, 17) (11, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (19, 9) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
The central idea is to check each node to see if it has at least 3 neighbors, as a 3-star requires a central node with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's go through each node to count the number of 3-stars around that node:

Node 0: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 1: Has 5 neighbors -> [10]
Node 2: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 3: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 4: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 7: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 8: Has 5 neighbors -> [10]
Node 9: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 10: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 11: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 12: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 13: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 14: Has 2 neighbors -> 0
Node 15: Has 3 neighbors -> 1
Node 16: Has 2 neighbors -> 0
Node 17: Has 2 neighbors -> 0
Node 18: Has 4 neighbors -> [1]
Node 19: Has 2 neighbors -> 0

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 10>
<0, 1, 18>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 9, 12>
<1, 9, 18>
<1, 7, 12>
