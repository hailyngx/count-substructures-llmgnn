Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 15) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 11) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 4) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52]. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (12, 13, 14)>, <0, (0, 13, 17)>, <0, (0, 15, 16)>, <0, (0, 12, 18)>, <0, (0, 16, 4)>, <1, (1, 5, 18)>, <3, (3, 14, 9)>, <5, (5, 8, 18)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (8, 5, 18)>, <9, (9, 6, 7)>, <12, (12, 19, 1)>, <13, (13, 7, 14)>, <14, (14, 3, 17)>, <15, (15, 0, 14)>, <16, (16, 0, 4)>, <17, (17, 0, 18)>, <18, (18, 5, 7)>, <19, (19, 1, 12)>.
