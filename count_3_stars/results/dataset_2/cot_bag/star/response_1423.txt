Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 19) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 11) (7, 19) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 15) (9, 15) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: node 10, node 18, node 8, node 1, and node 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center. 
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 18 as the center. 
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 19 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
