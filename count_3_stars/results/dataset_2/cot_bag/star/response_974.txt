Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's first identify these nodes:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors
Node 12: 5 neighbors
Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 9, 10)>
<2, (9, 12, 14)>
<4, (9, 13, 14)>
<5, (11, 12, 13)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<12, (5, 10, 12)>
<14, (2, 4, 12)>
