Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 17) (6, 5) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 10) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 16 are the only nodes with degree 4, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, Node 8, and Node 13 are the nodes with degree 4, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5, Node 6, Node 10, Node 11, Node 17, and Node 18 are the nodes with degree 3, so they can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding these up:  
4×2 (Node 0 and Node 16) + 4×3 (Node 3, Node 8, and Node 13) + 1×6 (Node 5, Node 6, Node 10, Node 11, Node 17, and Node 18) = 8 + 12 + 6 = 26

So the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 6, 16)>, <16, (4, 6, 12)>, <3, (1, 10, 19)>, <8, (13, 15, 19)>
