Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 34

So, the final answer within brackets is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 9, 2)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
