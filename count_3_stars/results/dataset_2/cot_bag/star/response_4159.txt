Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
To start, we determine the degree of each node by counting the number of edges incident to it:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3

We want to find 3-stars, so we focus on nodes with degree 3 or more:

- Node 11: 1 3-star (with nodes 13, 16)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (with nodes 11, 13)
- Node 18: 1 3-star (with nodes 4, 12)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (with nodes 3, 10)
- Node 13: No 3-star (degree 3, not counted)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (with nodes 8, 18)
- Node 5: No 3-star (degree 4, not counted)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (with nodes 4, 5)
- Node 12: No 3-star (degree 3, not counted)
- Node 0: No 3-star (degree 4, not counted)
- Node 7: No 3-star (degree 4, not counted)
- Node 19: No 3-star (degree 3, not counted)

Adding up the 3-stars found, we get a total of [4] 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars are: <11, 13, 16>, <4, 8, 18>, <4, 12, 18>, <3, 6, 10>.
