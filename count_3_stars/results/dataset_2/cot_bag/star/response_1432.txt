Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 4, 9, 8, 2, 5
2: 6, 5, 1
3: 7, 6, 8, 0
4: 7, 9, 8, 5, 1
5: 4, 2, 1
6: 7, 9, 2, 3, 0
7: 4, 6, 0, 3
8: 4, 3, 1
9: 4, 6, 0, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1: 4, 9, 8, 2, 5
3: 7, 6, 8, 0
4: 7, 9, 8, 5, 1
6: 7, 9, 2, 3, 0
8: 4, 3, 1
9: 4, 6, 0, 1

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 39 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39]. The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (8, 2, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (7, 0, 6)>
<3, (8, 0, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<4, (8, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<6, (2, 3, 0)>
<6, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 1)>
<9, (4, 0, 1)>
<9, (6, 0, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
