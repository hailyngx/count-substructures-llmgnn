Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are nodes with the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
