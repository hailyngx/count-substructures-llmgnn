Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges in the given graph. Let's determine the 3-stars present in this graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 20) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
2. Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 29) => This node has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
3. Node 1: (1, 10) => This node has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
4. Node 3: (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 12) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
5. Node 20: (20, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 10) => This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
6. Node 25: (25, 20) (25, 18) => This node has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
7. Node 10: (10, 1) (10, 20) (10, 17) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
8. Node 17: (17, 10) => This node has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
9. Node 19: No 3-stars can be formed as it has no neighbors.
10. Node 28: (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 4) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
11. Node 13: (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 15) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
12. Node 26: (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
13. Node 29: (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 21) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
14. Node 7: (7, 24) (7, 27) (7, 22) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
15. Node 16: (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
16. Node 4: (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 22) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
17. Node 22: (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
18. Node 11: (11, 20) (11, 26) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 2) => This node has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
19. Node 14: (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 8) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
20. Node 12: (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
21. Node 18: (18, 25) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 21) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
22. Node 0: (0, 3) (0, 26) => This node has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
23. Node 24: (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
24. Node 8: (8, 22) (8, 14) (8, 15) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
25. Node 2: (2, 11) (2, 6) => This node has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
26. Node 27: (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 22) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
27. Node 6: (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 23) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
28. Node 23: (23, 29) (23, 12) (23, 6) => This node has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star.
29. Node 15: (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) => This node has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars.
30. Node 21: (21, 29) (21, 18) => This node has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, 9, 13>, <3, 0, 27>, <20, 5, 25>, <20, 5, 26>, <20, 5, 11>, <20, 25, 18>, <10, 1, 17>, <28, 19, 26>, <13, 5, 4>, <13, 5, 24>, <13, 5, 15>, <13, 4, 24>, <13, 4, 15>, <13, 24, 15>, <26, 28, 4>, <26, 28, 11>, <26, 28, 0>, <26, 11, 0>, <29, 9, 23>, <29, 9, 21>, <7, 24, 27>, <16, 12, 18>, <16, 12, 23>, <16, 24, 14>, <4, 28, 22>, <22, 7, 27>, <22, 7, 8>, <11, 20, 26>, <11, 20, 14>, <11, 20, 15>, <11, 26, 0>, <11, 26, 14>, <11, 26, 15>, <11, 14, 15>, <22, 4, 27>, <22, 4, 8>, <22, 27, 8>, <12, 3, 16>, <12, 18, 6>, <18, 25, 6>, <21, 29, 18>, <24, 13, 16>, <14, 16, 8>, <2, 11, 6>, <27, 3, 22>, <6, 18, 23>, <6, 15, 23>.
