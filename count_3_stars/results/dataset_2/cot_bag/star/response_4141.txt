Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 4) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 15) (15, 7) (15, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 3) (19, 0) (19, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 8) (3, 13) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 10, 18}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {10, 15, 16, 2}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 7, 12, 17}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {6, 8, 18}
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: {3, 9}
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {8, 17, 18}
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: {4, 7}
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {4, 5, 17}
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {6, 14, 16, 5, 8}
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: {0, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of the identified nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: As it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: As it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: As it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
