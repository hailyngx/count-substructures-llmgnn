Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 6) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4+10+10+20+10+4+10+4+4+4 = 80 \)

Thus, the final answer is [80]. The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 17, 2, 12>, <3, 17, 1, 12>, <3, 4, 14, 13>, <3, 5, 15, 9>, <4, 13, 0, 18>, <10, 1, 12, 8>, <10, 6, 15, 9>, <11, 8, 12, 10>, <13, 0, 16, 18>, and <15, 6, 10, 5>.
