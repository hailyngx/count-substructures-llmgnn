Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 3, 8}
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {5, 3, 2, 13, 12}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 14, 11, 3}
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 1, 4, 0, 10}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 10, 8, 13}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 14, 10}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 2, 8, 14, 13}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 1, 11}
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {6, 1, 10}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {9, 4, 8, 10}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 75 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [75] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <4, (5, 14, 11)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 10)>, <10, (5, 6, 2)>.
