Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Now, apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

So, there are 60 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<[9, 5, 8]>, <[9, 8, 7]>, <[9, 3, 7]>, <[9, 3, 4]>, <[9, 4, 6]>, <[4, 6, 0]>, <[6, 4, 3]>, <[6, 3, 8]>, <[6, 8, 8]>, <[3, 4, 1]>, <[3, 8, 1]>, <[8, 1, 2]>.
