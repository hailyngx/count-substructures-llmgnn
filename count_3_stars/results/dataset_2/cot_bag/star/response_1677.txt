Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (14, 7) (14, 17) (17, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 1 are: 
<1, (7, 19, 15)>, <1, (7, 19, 0)>, <1, (19, 15, 18)>, <1, (19, 15, 6)>.

For node 2 (has 3 neighbors), only 1 3-star is formed with node 2 as the center: 
<2, (4, 3, 8)>.

For node 3 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 3 are: 
<3, (11, 5, 2)>, <3, (11, 5, 9)>, <3, (11, 2, 9)>, <3, (5, 12, 11)>.

For node 5 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 5 are: 
<5, (11, 12, 3)>, <5, (11, 12, 9)>, <5, (11, 3, 9)>, <5, (12, 19, 5)>.

For node 6 (has 3 neighbors), only 1 3-star is formed with node 6 as the center: 
<6, (7, 15, 13)>.

For node 7 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 7 are: 
<7, (1, 14, 10)>, <7, (1, 14, 17)>, <7, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (14, 17, 10)>.

For node 10 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 10 are: 
<10, (7, 12, 11)>, <10, (7, 12, 5)>, <10, (7, 11, 12)>, <10, (12, 5, 11)>.

For node 11 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 11 are: 
<11, (10, 5, 12)>, <11, (10, 5, 9)>, <11, (10, 12, 5)>, <11, (5, 12, 9)>.

For node 15 (has 3 neighbors), only 1 3-star is formed with node 15 as the center: 
<15, (1, 6, 18)>.

For node 16 (has 3 neighbors), only 1 3-star is formed with node 16 as the center: 
<16, (8, 19, 18)>.

For node 18 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 18 are: 
<18, (15, 19, 16)>, <18, (15, 19, 13)>, <18, (15, 16, 19)>, <18, (19, 16, 13)>.

For node 19 (has 4 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
The unique 3-stars involving node 19 are: 
<19, (5, 16, 18)>, <19, (5, 16, 0)>, <19, (5, 18, 16)>, <19, (16, 18, 0)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \[4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30\].

Thus, there are 30 3-stars in the given graph.
