Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 6, 9, 11, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 14)>
<6, (0, 9, 10)>
<9, (8, 13, 14)>
<11, (6, 10, 13)>
<14, (8, 11, 13)>
