Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (9, 6, 4, 8, 2)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (9, 8, 7)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 8, 0)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 2, 4)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (5, 3, 0, 2)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (9, 8, 4, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (9, 3, 0)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (5, 1)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (9, 1, 2, 0, 5)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 1, 0)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 8, 2)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 0)>,
<3, (5, 6, 2)>,
<4, (5, 3, 0)>,
<5, (9, 8, 7)>,
<8, (9, 1, 0)>,
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
