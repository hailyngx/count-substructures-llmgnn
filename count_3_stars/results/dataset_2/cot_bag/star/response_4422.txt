Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 18) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 25) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 24) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (23, 12) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 3) (20, 4) (28, 16) (28, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 23) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 20) (4, 3) (4, 24) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (21, 10) (21, 29) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 2) (24, 12) (14, 16) (14, 26) (14, 2) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 1) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 23) (12, 24) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which we will consider for forming 3-stars.

Now, let's go through each of these 10 nodes to find how many 3-stars can be formed using them:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 0 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <0, (9, 18, 20)>, <0, (9, 1, 27)>, <0, (9, 1, 18)>, <0, (9, 1, 20)>, <0, (18, 1, 20)>, <0, (27, 1, 18)>, <0, (27, 1, 20)>, <0, (18, 1, 20)>, <0, (18, 20, 3)>, <0, (18, 20, 4)>
   
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 1 = 1
   - <1, (0, 8, 6)>
   
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <2, (22, 7, 24)>, <2, (22, 7, 14)>, <2, (22, 24, 12)>, <2, (7, 24, 12)>
   
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 4 = 1
   - <4, (20, 3, 24)>
   
5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 7 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <7, (22, 23, 2)>, <7, (22, 23, 14)>, <7, (22, 2, 24)>, <7, (23, 2, 24)>
   
6. Node 9 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 9 = 1
   - <9, (0, 5, 15)>
   
7. Node 10 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 10 = 1
   - <10, (22, 21, 17)>
   
8. Node 11 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 11 = 1
   - <11, (8, 20, 29)>
   
9. Node 16 has 3 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 16 = 1
   - <16, (19, 14, 28)>
   
10. Node 19 has 4 neighbors:
   - Total possible 3-stars using node 19 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <19, (5, 23, 26)>, <19, (5, 12, 23)>, <19, (5, 14, 26)>, <19, (23, 12, 26)>

Adding up all the possibilities, we have a total of 27 3-stars in this graph: [27]
