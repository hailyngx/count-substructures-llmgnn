Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 26) (23, 25) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (20, 3) (20, 15) (17, 27) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 18) (4, 28) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 28) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 5) (26, 8) (26, 17) (26, 22) (26, 24) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 25) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 5) (7, 25) (7, 10) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 7) (25, 2) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 12) (16, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 15) (13, 21) (13, 11) (6, 29) (6, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 27) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 17) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 7) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 14)

There are some nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 11, 24, 9
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 20
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 10, 21, 26
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors: 25, 0
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 20, 9, 13
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 3, 15
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors: 27, 26
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 6, 21, 18
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 29, 27, 0, 28
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 26, 9, 6, 5
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 8, 17, 22, 24
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 15, 22, 0
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 1, 26, 25
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 23, 18, 9, 5
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 23, 24, 7
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 8, 29, 28, 13, 27
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 4, 18, 21, 19
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 16, 14
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 12, 5
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1, 13, 2
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 15, 21, 11
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 29, 22
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 12, 19, 2
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 28, 14, 27
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 22, 0, 16
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 17, 18, 21, 19
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 8, 7
