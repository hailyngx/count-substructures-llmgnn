Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 13, 5, 2, 9, 1, 10, 6, 3, 12, and 14.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 82 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<4, (7, 5, 10)>  
<7, (4, 3, 9)>  
<13, (2, 11, 3)>  
<5, (4, 0, 3)>  
<2, (4, 9, 13)>  
<9, (7, 8, 12)>  
<1, (6, 14, 10)>  
<10, (7, 5, 2)>  
<6, (1, 14, 3)>  
<3, (7, 13, 6)>  
<12, (13, 9, 14)>  
<14, (6, 9, 1)>
