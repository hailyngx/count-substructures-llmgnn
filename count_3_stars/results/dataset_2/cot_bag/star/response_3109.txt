Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 77 \)

So, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 12, 9)>
<5, (7, 2, 3)>
<6, (14, 11, 10)>
<7, (4, 14, 2)>
<8, (6, 11, 9)>
<9, (7, 12, 2)>
<11, (14, 13, 1)>
<12, (4, 5, 13)>
<13, (11, 14, 1)>
<14, (7, 11, 1)>
