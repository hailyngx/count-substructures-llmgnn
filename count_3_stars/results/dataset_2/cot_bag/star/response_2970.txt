Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (0, 16) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 17) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 13) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 16) (18, 15) (18, 3) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 1) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in this graph such as node 4, node 7, node 10, node 11, node 12, node 5 and node 2 each having three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 10, 14, 17.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 12, 13, 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 10:
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 13, 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 11:
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 10, 5, 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 7, 2, 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 11, 1, 14.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 12, 6, 19, 3, 17.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all the 3-stars for the above nodes, we get a total of 19 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <4, (10, 14, 17)>, <7, (12, 13, 8)>, <10, (4, 11, 13)>, <11, (10, 5, 8)>, <12, (7, 2, 9)>, <5, (11, 1, 14)>, and <2, (12, 6, 19)>.
