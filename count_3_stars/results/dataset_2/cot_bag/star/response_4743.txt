Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up at the end.

For Node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <4, (8, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>

For Node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (7, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (7, 6, 0)>, <8, (6, 0, 7)>, <8, (7, 0, 2)>, <8, (7, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 9)>

For Node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 6)>, <9, (8, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (8, 7, 4)>,  

For Node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<7, (8, 6, 0)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>, <7, (6, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 2, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (for Node 4) + 10 (for Node 8) + 10 (for Node 9) + 10 (for Node 7) = 40 [40]
