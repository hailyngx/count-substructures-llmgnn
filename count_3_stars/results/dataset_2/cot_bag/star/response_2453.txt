Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the edges provided, the neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 7, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is: [42]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
