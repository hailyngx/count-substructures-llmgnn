Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
Node 6 can form [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
Node 9 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 39.


Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].
