Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (7, 3, 5, 17, 2)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 3, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 17)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 17)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 17, 2)>, <4, (3, 5, 17)>, <4, (3, 5, 2)>, <4, (3, 17, 2)>, <4, (5, 17, 2)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 12, 23, 7)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (4, 12, 23)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (29, 27, 23, 19)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (29, 27, 23)>, <9, (29, 27, 19)>, <9, (29, 23, 19)>, <9, (27, 23, 19)>

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (17, 3, 1, 16)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (17, 3, 1)>

- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (7, 23, 0)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 12: 1
    - Unique 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (7, 23, 0)>

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (21, 11, 18)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 15: 1
    - Unique 3-stars with node 15 as the center: <15, (21, 11, 18)>

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (10, 17, 25, 18)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 16 as the center: <16, (10, 17, 25)>

- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (13, 3, 24, 10)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 19 as the center: <19, (13, 3, 24)>

- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: (28, 8, 15)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 21: 1
    - Unique 3-stars with node 21 as the center: <21, (28, 8, 15)>

- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (2, 11, 3)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 22: 1
    - Unique 3-stars with node 22 as the center: <22, (2, 11, 3)>

- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: (28, 27, 16, 18)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 25 as the center: <25, (28, 27, 16)>

- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: (21, 27, 25, 20)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 28 as the center: <28, (21, 27, 25)>

- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: (9, 24, 26)
    - Number of 3-stars for node 29: 1
    - Unique 3-stars with node 29 as the center: <29, (9, 24, 26)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].
