Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 1) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 11, 16, 5, 9, 7, 2, 18, 13, 10, 3, 1, 15, and 4. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<11, (16, 13, 17)>, <11, (16, 4, 15)>, <11, (13, 16, 4)>, <11, (13, 16, 12)>, <11, (4, 16, 10)>, <11, (4, 16, 15)>, <11, (17, 14, 4)>, <11, (17, 14, 7)>, <11, (15, 9, 5)>, <11, (15, 9, 6)>

For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<16, (11, 13, 4)>, <16, (11, 13, 12)>, <16, (11, 4, 15)>, <16, (13, 2, 12)>, <16, (13, 2, 7)>, <16, (4, 10, 15)>, <16, (4, 10, 5)>, <16, (10, 5, 9)>, <16, (10, 5, 18)>, <16, (5, 18, 2)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 18, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (18, 2, 19)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 12)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (16, 14, 6)>, <7, (16, 14, 17)>, <7, (6, 3, 12)>, <7, (6, 3, 8)>

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<2, (18, 19, 13)>

For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<18, (5, 2, 19)>

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (11, 16, 2)>, <13, (11, 16, 12)>, <13, (16, 2, 12)>, <13, (16, 2, 7)>

For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<10, (5, 19, 4)>

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<3, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

For node 15: No 3-star can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (11, 16, 10)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 36 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].
