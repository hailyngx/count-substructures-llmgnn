Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>.
