Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (12, 0, 4)>
<1, (6, 1, 11)>
<2, (9, 2, 17)>
<3, (10, 3, 15)>
<4, (17, 4, 14)>
<5, (12, 5, 10)>
<7, (0, 7, 19)>
<15, (8, 15, 7)>
<17, (4, 17, 7)>
<19, (7, 19, 13)>
