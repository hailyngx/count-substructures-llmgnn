Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 12, 15)>, <2, (1, 7, 15)>, <4, (8, 14, 11)>, <8, (4, 14, 11)>, <10, (17, 13, 19)>, <11, (4, 7, 1)>, <12, (18, 5, 14)>, <15, (2, 4, 19)>.
