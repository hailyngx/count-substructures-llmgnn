Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
We first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 13, 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 10
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 10, 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 12, 13
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13, 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 11, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9, 12, 13
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 10, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7

Based on the construction of the graph, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 13, 14)>, <0, (1, 10, 14)>, <0, (10, 12, 14)>, <0, (13, 7, 14)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 14)>
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 10)>, <2, (3, 12, 10)>
- Node 3 forms no 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 10)>
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 12)>, <5, (6, 13, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (8, 11, 13)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (6, 11, 13)>, <7, (13, 14, 0)>
- Node 8 forms no 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (11, 13, 3)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (2, 12, 3)>
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars: <11, (6, 7, 13)>, <11, (9, 12, 3)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (10, 11, 3)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (6, 7, 11)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (0, 7, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
