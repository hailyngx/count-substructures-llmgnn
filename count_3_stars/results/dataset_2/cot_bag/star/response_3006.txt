Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (11, 23) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 14) (10, 16) (10, 14) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 22) (21, 24) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 2) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (12, 21) (12, 13) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 1) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 14) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 27) (26, 8) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 21) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 27) (27, 1) (27, 22) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 10) (14, 25) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the 3-star graph and then calculate the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 22, 2}
- Node 1: {29, 25, 27}
- Node 2: {3, 0, 19}
- Node 3: {15, 7, 23, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 23}
- Node 6: {15, 5, 18}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 29, 26}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 25, 24}
- Node 10: {16, 14}
- Node 11: {23}
- Node 12: {21, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 12, 24}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 23, 10, 25}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 10, 0}
- Node 17: {4, 19, 24}
- Node 18: {4, 6, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 2, 17}
- Node 20: {21, 29}
- Node 21: {20, 12, 22, 24}
- Node 22: {21, 0, 25, 27}
- Node 23: {3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 24: {9, 21, 17, 13}
- Node 25: {9, 1, 22, 14}
- Node 26: {8}
- Node 27: {1, 22}

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of unique 3-stars: [31]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 15, 7)>
<4, (7, 17, 14)>
<5, (9, 6, 23)>
<6, (18, 19, 4)>
<9, (24, 25, 14)>
<10, (16, 14, 25)>
<13, (12, 7, 24)>
<14, (23, 25, 4)>
<15, (16, 3, 6)>
<16, (0, 10, 15)>
<21, (20, 22, 29)>
<24, (13, 21, 9)>
<25, (1, 14, 22)>
<27, (1, 22, 25)>
<3, (15, 23, 7)>

<15, (0, 16, 6)>
<21, (20, 24, 29)>
<24, (13, 17, 21)>
<25, (1, 14, 22)>
