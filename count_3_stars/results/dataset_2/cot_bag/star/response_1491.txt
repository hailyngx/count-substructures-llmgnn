Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (5, 0, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 0, 1)>, <2, (0, 7, 3)>

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (9, 8, 6)>, <3, (9, 8, 2)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 6, 2)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 6, 2)>, <3, (8, 6, 7)>, <3, (8, 2, 7)>, <3, (6, 2, 7)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (8, 3, 7)>

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<5, (1, 4, 2)>

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (6, 7, 3)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>

Summing up all the 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].
