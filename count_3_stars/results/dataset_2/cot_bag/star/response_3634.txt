Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 7, 1, 3, 17, 10, 15, 19, 5, 2, 6, 12, 0, and 18.

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \)
So, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (16, 0, 13)>
- <11, (16, 0, 12)>
- <11, (16, 0, 17)>
- <11, (16, 13, 12)>
- <11, (16, 13, 17)>
- <11, (0, 12, 17)>
- <16, (2, 7, 11)>
- <7, (2, 19, 1)>
- <1, (3, 17, 19)>
- <3, (14, 6, 1)>
- <10, (8, 9, 15)>
- <15, (0, 19, 10)>
- <19, (6, 1, 7)>
- <5, (4, 14, 12)>
- <2, (9, 13, 7)>
- <6, (8, 19, 3)>
- <12, (5, 18, 11)>
- <0, (15, 18, 11)>
- <18, (0, 6, 12)>
