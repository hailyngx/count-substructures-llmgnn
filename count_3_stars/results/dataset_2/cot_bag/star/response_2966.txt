Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 5 neighbors: node 5, node 1, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 65 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [65].
The unique 3-stars are: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>.
