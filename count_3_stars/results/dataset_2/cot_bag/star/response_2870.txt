Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 17) (26, 22) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 16) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 28) (15, 20) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 11) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 27) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (29, 23) (29, 20) (3, 17) (3, 21) (3, 28) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 3) (28, 4) (4, 23) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 10) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 27) (24, 19) (24, 11) (24, 25) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 18) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 19) (2, 25) (2, 16) (13, 14) (18, 14) (18, 7) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 20) (10, 4) (27, 6) (27, 19) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {16, 19, 21, 25}
- Node 3: {17, 21, 28}
- Node 4: {10, 15, 23, 28}
- Node 5: {11}
- Node 6: {22, 27}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 14, 18, 27}
- Node 8: {19, 23, 28}
- Node 9: {17, 25}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 20}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 20, 24, 27}
- Node 12: {1, 15, 21}
- Node 13: {14}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {4, 12, 16, 20}
- Node 16: {2, 15, 22}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 14}
- Node 18: {7, 14}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 24, 27}
- Node 20: {10, 11, 15, 29}
- Node 21: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 22: {6, 16, 23, 26}
- Node 23: {4, 8, 22, 29}
- Node 24: {11, 19, 25}
- Node 25: {2, 9, 24}
- Node 26: {22}
- Node 27: {6, 7, 11, 19}
- Node 28: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 29: {20, 23}

Based on the node degrees, we see that only nodes 14, 15, 20, and 23 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will focus on these nodes for counting the 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [22] \) 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <14, (1, 7, 18)>
2. <14, (1, 7, 13)>
3. <14, (1, 12, 7)>
4. <14, (7, 17, 18)>
5. <14, (13, 17, 18)>
6. <15, (4, 20, 29)>
7. <15, (12, 20, 29)>
8. <15, (4, 20, 11)>
9. <15, (4, 16, 20)>
10. <20, (10, 24, 11)>
11. <20, (10, 11, 27)>
12. <20, (10, 27, 19)>
13. <20, (4, 24, 11)>
14. <23, (4, 8, 29)>
15. <23, (4, 23, 8)>
16. <23, (4, 23, 29)>
17. <23, (8, 22, 29)>
