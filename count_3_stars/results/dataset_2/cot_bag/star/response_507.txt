Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph: 

We will check each node to see if it can be the center of a 3-star, i.e., if it has at least 3 neighbors.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors (and therefore can form 3-stars): {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29}

Calculating the number of 3-stars using each of these nodes as the center:

- Node 0 can form 3-stars with 4 other nodes: 14, 6, 7, and 9. There are 4 such 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with 5 other nodes: 11, 12, 13, 18, and 22. There are 5 such 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with 4 other nodes: 10, 12, 25, and 26. There are 4 such 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with 4 other nodes: 8, 28, 4, and 29. There are 4 such 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with 4 other nodes: 15, 23, 0, and 28. There are 4 such 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with 4 other nodes: 12, 19, 0, and 23. There are 4 such 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form 3-stars with 5 other nodes: 2, 3, 7, 21, and 29. There are 5 such 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form 3-stars with 5 other nodes: 2, 17, 18, 19, and 26. There are 5 such 3-stars.
- Node 15 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 6, 8, and 29. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 16 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 1, 9, and 17. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 13, 20, and 2. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 1, 13, and 7. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 21 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 12, 24, and 28. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 23 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 6, 7, and 10. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 24 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 21, 22, and 12. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 25 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 3, 14, and 0. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 26 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 3, 13, and 19. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 28 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 5, 6, and 21. There are 3 such 3-stars.
- Node 29 can form 3-stars with 3 other nodes: 15, 12, and 5. There are 3 such 3-stars.

Adding up all these possible 3-stars, we get a total of 4+5+4+4+4+4+5+5+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 65.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65]. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 6, 7, 9>
<2, 11, 12, 13>
<3, 10, 12, 25>
<5, 4, 8, 28>
<6, 0, 15, 28>
<7, 0, 12, 19>
<12, 2, 3, 7>
<13, 2, 17, 18>
<15, 6, 8, 29>
<16, 1, 9, 17>
<18, 2, 13, 20>
