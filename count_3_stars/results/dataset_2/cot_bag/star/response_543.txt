Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 3), 
(1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), 
(2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), 
(3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 0), 
(4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), 
(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 7), 
(6, 8), (6, 2), (6, 7), 
(7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 3), 
(8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 3), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 8, 4, 7 => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 8, 3, 1, 5 => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 8, 0, 1, 5 => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 2, 6, 3 => inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 6, 7 => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 9, 4, 7 => 1 3-star (itself)
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 8, 2, 7 => 1 3-star (itself)
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 7, 0 => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 2, 1, 6, 3 => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
