Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be represented as: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The numbers within the parenthesis represent the edges between nodes. 

Upon examining the edges, we can identify the neighbors for each node:

0 (1, 3, 6, 7, 8)

1 (0, 3, 4, 7)

2 (3, 5, 6, 7, 9)

3 (0, 1, 2, 5, 8)

4 (1, 5, 9)

5 (2, 3, 4)

6 (0, 2, 8, 9)

7 (0, 1, 2, 8)

8 (0, 3, 6, 7)

9 (2, 4, 6)

By examining the number of neighbors for each node, we can determine which nodes are part of a 3-star structure:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8 have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and 7 have 4 neighbors, each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 and 9 have 3 neighbors, so each can form only 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
10 3-stars from nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8
4 3-stars from nodes 1 and 7
1 3-star from nodes 4 and 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [60] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
