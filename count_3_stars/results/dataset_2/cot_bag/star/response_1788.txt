Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's analyze which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-star graphs:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 2)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (8, 4, 11, 14)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 12, 10)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (9, 6, 8)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 0, 10, 7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 14, 3, 13)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 0, 11, 14)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (13, 11, 3, 1, 9)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 2, 11, 13)
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors (9, 8, 7, 14, 1)
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (4, 10, 2)
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 8, 14)
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (6, 13, 7, 11, 1)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star graphs for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 5 3-stars
- Node 2: 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 10 3-stars
- Node 11: 10 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 4 3-stars
- Node 14: 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 5 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs formed in this graph is [74].
