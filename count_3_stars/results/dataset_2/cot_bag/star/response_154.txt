Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 0) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 18) (7, 1) (7, 10) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 13) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 10) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
Considering the given information, we'll start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors - 15, 8, 19, 6
Node 1: Neighbors - 15, 11, 8, 7
Node 2: Neighbors - 3, 10
Node 3: Neighbors - 13, 2
Node 4: Neighbors - 19, 12
Node 5: Neighbors - 9, 19, 8, 15
Node 6: Neighbors - 17, 0, 16
Node 7: Neighbors - 1, 10
Node 8: Neighbors - 5, 1, 0
Node 9: Neighbors - 5, 11, 17
Node 10: Neighbors - 12, 7, 13, 18, 2
Node 12: Neighbors - 4, 10, 14
Node 13: Neighbors - 3, 16, 10
Node 15: Neighbors - 5, 1, 0, 17
Node 16: Neighbors - 6, 17, 13
Node 17: Neighbors - 9, 15, 6, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: No 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, 15, 8, 19>, <1, 15, 11, 8>, <5, 9, 19, 8>, <6, 17, 0>, <10, 12, 14>, <17, 9, 15>, <10, 7, 13, 18>, <2, 3, 10>.  

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
