Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with degree greater than or equal to 3 are: 5, 9, 6, 10, 11, 2, 8, 0, 1, 7, 14, 12, 13, 4.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 83

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is: [83]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <5, (1, 11, 7)>, <5, (9, 12, 11)>, <5, (1, 12, 11)>, <5, (9, 10, 11)>, <5, (7, 11, 1)>, <5, (10, 1, 11)>, <5, (9, 5, 12)>, <5, (7, 5, 11)>, <5, (1, 5, 11)>, <5, (9, 5, 1)>, <9, (5, 10, 11)>, <9, (5, 12, 11)>, <9, (5, 1, 11)>, <6, (2, 13, 14)>, <10, (9, 11, 12)>, <10, (9, 4, 11)>, <10, (4, 1, 11)>, <10, (4, 11, 9)>, <11, (7, 12, 14)>, <11, (12, 7, 14)>, <2, (6, 0, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <0, (2, 8, 13)>, <1, (4, 12, 5)>, <7, (11, 14, 7)>
