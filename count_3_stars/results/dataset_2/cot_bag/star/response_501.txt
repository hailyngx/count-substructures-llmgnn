Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 8, 2, 18, 14, 12, 3, 11, 5, 6, 13, and 16.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 59. Therefore, there are 59 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (8, 14, 17)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (18, 6, 11)>, <18, (4, 2, 9)>, <14, (4, 0, 3)>, <12, (7, 5, 17)>, <3, (14, 7, 13)>, <11, (2, 0, 9)>, <5, (8, 12, 16)>, <6, (8, 2, 19)>, <13, (18, 1, 3)>, <16, (14, 1, 5)>.
