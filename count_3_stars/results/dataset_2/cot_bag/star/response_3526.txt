Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 10) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (20, 19) (20, 6) (29, 27) (29, 12) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (19, 20) (19, 6) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 5) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 29) (12, 2) (5, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 2) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 10) (14, 16) (14, 15) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 22) (7, 1) (10, 28) (10, 25) (0, 25) (0, 4) (0, 23) (17, 24) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 23) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (23, 0) (23, 17) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the central nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 16, 3, 1, 18, 5
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 11, 14
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 7, 14, 4
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors: 29, 24
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 9, 5, 22
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 26, 9, 10
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 27, 26, 17
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 28, 24, 7
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 11, 17, 3
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 19, 6
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors: 27, 12
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 11, 18, 4
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 17, 7
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 20, 6
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 22, 12, 5
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 11, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 20, 19, 1, 13
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 29, 2
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 11, 21, 8, 2
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 21, 28, 25
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 4, 10
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 16, 15
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 15, 26, 8, 22, 1
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 28, 25
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 25, 4, 23
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 24, 18, 8, 23
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 15, 3, 25, 0, 13
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 6, 4
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors: 0, 17

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 5
- Node 11: 1
- Node 17: 4
- Node 24: 3
- Node 25: 4
- Node 26: 3

Adding these up, we get a total of [21] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<7, (1, 7, 22)>
<7, (8, 7, 22)>
<7, (15, 7, 26)>

<7, (7, 15, 26)>
<11, (3, 11, 18)>
<17, (8, 17, 23)>
<17, (17, 18, 8)>
<17, (17, 8, 23)>
