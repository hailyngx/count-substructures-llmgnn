Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 29) (16, 26) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 0) (5, 11) (5, 6) (21, 25) (21, 24) (28, 7) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 26) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 27) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 29) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 12) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 8) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 25) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 4) (25, 23) (8, 27) (8, 12) (8, 18) (10, 4) (12, 24) (12, 8) (23, 13) (23, 25) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (11, 6, 20)>, <2, (13, 9, 19)>, <6, (15, 7, 0)>, <7, (26, 27, 29)>, <9, (2, 27, 6)>, <11, (0, 17, 5)>, <13, (15, 25, 22)>, <14, (4, 17, 22)>, <15, (17, 6, 13)>, <17, (11, 14, 15)>, <18, (3, 8, 6)>, <22, (14, 15, 13)>, <24, (1, 12, 3)>, <25, (23, 13, 4)>, <26, (29, 16, 7)>, <27, (1, 8, 7)>, <29, (26, 7, 16)>
