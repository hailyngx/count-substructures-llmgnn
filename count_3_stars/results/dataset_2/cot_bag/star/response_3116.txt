Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 18) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 15) (9, 17) (9, 0) (15, 12) (15, 6) (15, 13) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: {3, 4}
3: {1, 4, 8}
4: {1, 3, 19}
8: {3, 14, 7}
10: {12, 13, 16}
11: {14}
12: {10, 16, 15}
13: {10, 18, 15}
14: {11, 8, 16}
15: {12, 6, 13}
16: {10, 12, 14, 5, 6}
17: {6, 9}
0: {7, 18, 19, 9}
5: {16}
2: {19}
6: {17, 7, 18, 16, 15}
7: {8, 0, 6, 18}
9: {17, 0}
18: {0, 7, 19, 6, 13}
19: {4, 0, 18, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 9.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 19)>
<8, (3, 14, 7)>
<10, (12, 13, 16)>
<16, (10, 12, 14)>
<16, (12, 14, 5)>
<16, (14, 5, 6)>
<18, (0, 7, 19)>
<0, (7, 18, 19)>
