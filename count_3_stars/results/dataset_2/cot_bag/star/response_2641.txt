Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves to find the 3-stars.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 8, and 4.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the central node: <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0, and 1.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node: <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>.

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 1.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node: <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (3, 6, 1)>.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, and 6.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node: <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>.

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, and 2.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the central node: <3, (7, 1, 6)>, <3, (7, 1, 2)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 1.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the central node: <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 7, 1)>, <6, (9, 7, 1)>.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 2. Since it has exactly 4 neighbors, we need to check for unique 3-stars.
There is 1 3-star with node 0 as the central node: <0, (5, 9, 4)>.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 0. Since it has only 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3. Since it has only 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars with node 8 as the central node.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 0. Since it has only 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [25].
