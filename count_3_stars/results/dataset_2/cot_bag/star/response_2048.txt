Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 4) (5, 11) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 19) (8, 15) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 15) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing these up, we have a total of 39 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [39].
And the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (11, 12, 14)>, <0, (11, 13, 15)>, <0, (11, 13, 17)>, <0, (11, 15, 13)>, <0, (12, 3, 15)>, <0, (13, 10, 15)>, <0, (13, 11, 15)>, <0, (13, 15, 17)>, <0, (14, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 14, 1)>, <3, (10, 9, 12)>, <3, (10, 13, 9)>, <3, (12, 16, 9)>, <4, (10, 17, 3)>, <7, (14, 9, 19)>, <9, (14, 7, 16)>, <10, (13, 17, 3)>, <13, (11, 15, 17)>, <15, (0, 13, 8)>, <15, (0, 13, 15)>.
