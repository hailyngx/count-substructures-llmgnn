Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 3, 7, 2
Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 3, 5, 8
Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 0
Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 0, 5, 2
Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 1, 2, 5
Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 4, 2, 3, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the possible 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 2, 9)>, <0, (9, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 1)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 5)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>
