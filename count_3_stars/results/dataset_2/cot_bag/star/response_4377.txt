Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (8, 11, 18)>, 
<1, (4, 11, 17)>, 
<2, (5, 10, 19)>, 
<3, (14, 15, 16)>, 
<6, (0, 12, 4)>, 
<15, (9, 16, 17)>.
