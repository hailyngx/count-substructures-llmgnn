Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
14. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, we get a total of 70 3-stars. So, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 13)>, <2, (0, 3, 11)>, <3, (2, 7, 11)>, <4, (2, 10, 12)>, <5, (8, 10, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (3, 9, 13)>, <8, (1, 5, 14)>, <10, (0, 5, 14)>, <11, (0, 3, 12)>, <12, (4, 11, 13)>, <14, (5, 7, 8)>
