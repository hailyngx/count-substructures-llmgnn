Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 14, 13, 4, 0}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 10, 13, 5}
- Node 5: {11, 7, 4, 12}
- Node 6: {10, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 7: {10, 8, 9, 6, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {11, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 4}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 0, 5}
- Node 13: {11, 1, 4}
- Node 14: {1, 0, 6}

By analyzing the nodes, we can see which nodes have at least three neighbors to form a 3-star. 
The nodes that can form 3-stars are: 1, 6, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, let's count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 38 \).

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <1, (0, 13, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 14)>
- <1, (0, 3, 12)>
- <1, (2, 4, 13)>
- <1, (2, 4, 14)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 0, 12)>
- <1, (4, 10, 13)>
- <1, (4, 13, 11)>
- <6, (2, 7, 10)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 10, 4)>
- <7, (6, 9, 10)>
- <7, (6, 9, 11)>
- <7, (6, 10, 4)>
- <7, (6, 10, 5)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 11)>
- <8, (7, 9, 11)>
- <8, (7, 9, 13)>
