Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 12) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (12, 15) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 10, 5, 4, 1, 15, 16, 13, 7, 17, 19, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 10, 5)>, <6, (9, 17, 4)>, <6, (9, 17, 19)>, <9, (6, 10, 6)>, <9, (6, 10, 19)>, <9, (6, 17, 10)>, <9, (6, 17, 19)>, <10, (6, 9, 6)>, <10, (6, 9, 19)>, <5, (6, 11, 7)>, <15, (2, 1, 18)>, <15, (2, 1, 13)>, <15, (2, 18, 1)>, <15, (2, 18, 13)>, <15, (1, 2, 18)>, <15, (1, 2, 13)>, <15, (1, 18, 2)>, <15, (1, 18, 13)>, <16, (0, 13, 8)>, <13, (4, 1, 16)>, <13, (4, 1, 7)>, <13, (4, 16, 1)>, <13, (4, 16, 7)>, <13, (1, 4, 16)>, <13, (1, 4, 7)>, <13, (1, 16, 4)>, <13, (1, 16, 7)>, <7, (11, 5, 8)>, <17, (6, 9, 3)>, <19, (6, 2, 14)>, <19, (6, 2, 3)>, <19, (2, 6, 14)>, <19, (2, 6, 3)>, <8, (10, 16, 7)>.
