Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 10, 12, 4, 18, 16, 1, 0, 14, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node gives us a total of 24 3-stars. 

So, the final result is [24]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 18, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 7, 2)>, <10, (2, 12, 15)>, <10, (6, 12, 15)>, <10, (6, 2, 15)>, <10, (6, 2, 12)>, <12, (1, 4, 11)>, <12, (4, 10, 11)>, <12, (10, 1, 11)>, <12, (10, 4, 11)>, <4, (0, 11, 12)>, <4, (1, 11, 12)>, <4, (10, 11, 12)>, <4, (10, 0, 11)>, <1, (13, 7, 12)>, <1, (13, 12, 4)>, <1, (7, 13, 12)>, <1, (7, 12, 4)>, <0, (11, 19, 4)>, <0, (11, 4, 12)>, <0, (19, 11, 4)>, <0, (19, 4, 12)>
