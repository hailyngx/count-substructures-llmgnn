Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

From the given edges, we can construct the following adjacency list:
- Node 0: {10, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {10, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {11, 2, 13, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 13, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 0}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 5, 6, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 9: {10, 7, 12, 13, 4}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 14, 13, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 1, 9}
- Node 13: {11, 5, 4, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {11, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars in the graph} = \sum_{\text{node } v} \binom{d(v)}{3} \]

where \(d(v)\) is the degree of node \(v\).

Calculating for each relevant node:
- For node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- For node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- For node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 11: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [83] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 10)>, <2, (3, 4, 13)>, <3, (11, 13, 4)>, <4, (2, 13, 3)>, <7, (1, 9, 12)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (10, 12, 13)>, <10, (1, 7, 9)>, <11, (12, 13, 14)>
