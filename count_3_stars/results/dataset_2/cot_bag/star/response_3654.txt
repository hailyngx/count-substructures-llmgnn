Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 4: It has neighbors {7, 8, 12, 10, 5}. Using \( \binom{5}{3} \), we can form 10 3-stars.
2. Node 7: It has neighbors {4, 3, 1}. Using \( \binom{3}{3} \), we can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 1: It has neighbors {7, 3, 11, 10}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
4. Node 3: It has neighbors {7, 1, 14, 6}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 8: It has neighbors {4, 13, 2, 12}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 6: It has neighbors {3, 9, 5, 2}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 9: It has neighbors {6, 2, 0, 12}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 5: It has neighbors {4, 6, 12, 0, 10}. Using \( \binom{5}{3} \), we can form 10 3-stars.
9. Node 2: It has neighbors {8, 6, 9, 12}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 0: It has neighbors {13, 9, 5, 11}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
11. Node 12: It has neighbors {4, 8, 9, 5, 2}. Using \( \binom{5}{3} \), we can form 10 3-stars.
12. Node 11: It has neighbors {1, 13, 0}. Using \( \binom{3}{3} \), we can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 13: It has neighbors {8, 11, 14, 0}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 14: It has neighbors {3, 13, 10}. Using \( \binom{3}{3} \), we can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 10: It has neighbors {4, 1, 5, 14}. Using \( \binom{4}{3} \), we can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 59 3-stars. So, the final answer is [59].
