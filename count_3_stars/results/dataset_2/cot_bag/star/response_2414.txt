Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (4, 13) (4, 29) (7, 29) (7, 5) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 18) (25, 24) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 24) (18, 25) (18, 5) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 21) (28, 11) (28, 19) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 22) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 16) (22, 27) (22, 12) (22, 19) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 6) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 1) (0, 17) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 15, 27, 1, 4, 7, 10, 17, 2, 20, 25, 11, 12, 23, 19, 22, 29, 6, 14, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
25: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 67

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<15, (5, 8, 23)>
<27, (1, 22, 15)>
<27, (1, 26, 15)>
<27, (1, 15, 8)>
<1, (27, 17, 13)>
<17, (1, 8, 10)>
<25, (20, 24, 21)>
<19, (23, 2, 28)>
<22, (27, 12, 19)>
<8, (15, 16, 8)>
