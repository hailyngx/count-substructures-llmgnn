Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
