Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (0, 10) (0, 8) (27, 12) (27, 9) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 23) (20, 3) (26, 28) (26, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 10) (22, 15) (29, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 3) (16, 2) (16, 24) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 16) (3, 20) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 11) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 19) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 23) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 3) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 19) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 4 or more neighbors, which are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15.   

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Summing up these numbers, we have a total of 52 3-stars in this graph.

So, the answer is: [52]  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 16)>
<3, (10, 17, 19)>
<4, (2, 7, 12)>
<5, (2, 11, 14)>
<7, (4, 9, 13)>
<10, (3, 12, 28)>
<12, (4, 10, 23)>
<15, (2, 8, 22)>
