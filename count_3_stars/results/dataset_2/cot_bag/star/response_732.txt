Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (9, 0), (4, 0), (1, 0), (0, 10), (0, 13)
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (9, 1, 10)>, <0, (9, 1, 13)>, <0, (9, 10, 13)>, <0, (4, 1, 10)>, <0, (4, 1, 13)>, <0, (4, 10, 13)>, <0, (1, 10, 13)>, <0, (1, 10, 13)>, <0, (9, 10, 13)>, <0, (9, 10, 13)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (10, 2), (13, 2)
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (5, 4, 10)>, <2, (5, 4, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (4, 3, 10)>, <2, (4, 3, 13)>, <2, (4, 10, 13)>, <2, (3, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (9, 3), (1, 3), (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 12)
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (9, 1, 11)>, <3, (9, 1, 12)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>, <3, (1, 2, 11)>, <3, (1, 2, 12)>, <3, (1, 11, 12)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>

Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (5, 4), (7, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (4, 12), (4, 14)
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<4, (5, 1, 12)>, <4, (5, 1, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 1, 12)>, <4, (7, 1, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (1, 0, 12)>, <4, (1, 0, 14)>, <4, (1, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>

Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (11, 13), (0, 13), (2, 13), (6, 13), (14, 13)
Number of 3-stars with node 13 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<13, (11, 0, 2)>, <13, (11, 0, 6)>, <13, (11, 0, 14)>, <13, (11, 2, 6)>, <13, (11, 2, 14)>, <13, (11, 6, 14)>, <13, (0, 2, 6)>, <13, (0, 2, 14)>, <13, (0, 6, 14)>, <13, (11, 0, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 \).
Therefore, the final answer is [60].
