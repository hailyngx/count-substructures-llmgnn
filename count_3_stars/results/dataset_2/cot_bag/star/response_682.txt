Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 12), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 0), 
(4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 1), (4, 11), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 13), (7, 5), 
(5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 14), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 12), 
(8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 10), (11, 4), 
(11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 12), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 1), 
(12, 6), (12, 2), (12, 8), (12, 11), (12, 1), (14, 6), (14, 5), (14, 1), 
(14, 13), (13, 7), (13, 11), (13, 14), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 3), (1, 4), 
(1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 12), (1, 14)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. 

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 1), (4, 11)
    - Number of 3-stars centered at 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
    3-stars: <4, (7, 10, 1)>, <4, (7, 10, 11)>, <4, (7, 1, 11)>, <4, (10, 1, 11)>

2. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 14)
    - Number of 3-stars centered at 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
    3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 1)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 14)>, <5, (6, 0, 14)>, <5, (7, 1, 0)>, <5, (7, 1, 14)>, <5, (7, 0, 14)>, <5, (1, 0, 14)>

3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 12)
    - Number of 3-stars centered at 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
    3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 14)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 3)>, <6, (9, 14, 12)>, <6, (9, 3, 12)>, <6, (5, 14, 3)>, <6, (5, 14, 12)>, <6, (5, 3, 12)>, <6, (14, 3, 12)>

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
