Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- From the nodes above, there are 7 nodes with degree at least 3.
- Inom{7}{3} = 35

Putting it all together, there are [35] 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 0>
