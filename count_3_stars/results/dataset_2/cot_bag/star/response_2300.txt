Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (5, 9) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 13) (18, 12) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 1) (7, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 9, 15, 6, 14, 17, 8, 13, 2, 10, 12, 16, 1, 4, 19, 11, and 0.  
Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes.

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <3, (15, 9, 4)>, <3, (15, 9, 0)>, <3, (15, 4, 9)>, <3, (15, 0, 9)>

2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars <9, (3, 6, 5)>, <9, (3, 6, 1)>, <9, (3, 5, 1)>, <9, (3, 5, 4)>, <9, (6, 10, 5)>, <9, (6, 10, 1)>, <9, (6, 5, 1)>, <9, (6, 5, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>

3. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <15, (3, 10, 0)>, <15, (3, 10, 2)>, <15, (10, 6, 0)>, <15, (10, 6, 2)>

4. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <6, (9, 10, 0)>, <6, (9, 10, 17)>, <6, (10, 15, 0)>, <6, (10, 15, 17)>

5. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <14, (17, 4, 2)>, <14, (17, 2, 13)>, <14, (4, 2, 16)>, <14, (4, 16, 13)>

6. Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars <17, (14, 1, 16)>, <17, (14, 1, 19)>, <17, (14, 16, 19)>, <17, (1, 16, 19)>, <17, (1, 19, 7)>, <17, (16, 19, 7)>, <17, (16, 1, 7)>, <17, (19, 7, 11)>, <17, (19, 11, 7)>, <17, (7, 11, 1)>

7. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <8, (13, 12, 16)>

8. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <13, (8, 2, 12)>, <13, (8, 2, 16)>, <13, (8, 12, 16)>, <13, (2, 12, 16)>

9. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <2, (15, 13, 14)>, <2, (15, 13, 7)>, <2, (15, 14, 7)>, <2, (13, 14, 7)>

10. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <10, (15, 6, 11)>, <10, (15, 6, 0)>, <10, (15, 11, 0)>, <10, (6, 11, 0)>

11. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <12, (8, 13, 18)>, <12, (8, 13, 16)>, <12, (8, 18, 16)>, <12, (13, 18, 16)>

12. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <16, (17, 8, 4)>, <16, (17, 8, 12)>, <16, (17, 4, 12)>, <16, (8, 4, 12)>

13. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <1, (9, 17, 7)>

14. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <4, (3, 14, 16)>, <4, (3, 16, 14)>, <4, (14, 16, 2)>, <4, (16, 2, 13)>

15. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <19, (17, 11, 7)>

16. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <11, (10, 19, 7)>

17. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <0, (15, 6, 10)>

Adding all the different 3-stars we found: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
