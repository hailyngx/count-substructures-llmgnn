Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8.  
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, 9.  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 9.  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 9.  
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 9.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7.

Based on the given edges, we see that the nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
