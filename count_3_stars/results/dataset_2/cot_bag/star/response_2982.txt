Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 20) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 17) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 12) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 20) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 4) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 23) (29, 28) (29, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 25) (13, 1) (26, 16) (26, 25) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 19) (24, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 12) (7, 24) (7, 25) (7, 9) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 6) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 24) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 24) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 0) (14, 18) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 
\[ 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 24 \]

- For nodes with 4 neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 24 + 21 = 45. 

So, the final answer is [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (15, 18, 19)>
<2, (4, 27, 5)>
<3, (16, 23, 0)>
<4, (11, 27, 6)>
<6, (22, 29, 19)>
<8, (11, 25, 12)>
<10, (16, 17, 20)>
<12, (8, 23, 20)>
<15, (27, 19, 0)>
<16, (3, 26, 20)>
<17, (10, 18, 20)>
<18, (15, 17, 14)>
<19, (24, 6, 15)>
<21, (22, 23, 24)>
<22, (21, 23, 6)>
<23, (3, 29, 21)>
<24, (7, 19, 21)>
<25, (13, 8, 7)>
<27, (15, 4, 28)>
<28, (0, 27, 29)>
