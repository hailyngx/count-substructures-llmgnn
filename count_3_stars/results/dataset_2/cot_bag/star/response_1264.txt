Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 17) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 19) (7, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54 \)

So, there are a total of 54 unique 3-stars in the graph formed by the given nodes and edges:
\[ [54] \]
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (12, 6, 13)>, <6, (10, 15, 19)>, <12, (3, 5, 9)>, <13, (1, 6, 8)>, <14, (9, 10, 11)>, <15, (4, 5, 18)>, <19, (0, 7, 18)>
