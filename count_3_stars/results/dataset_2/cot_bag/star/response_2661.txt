Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0: neighbors {7, 6, 5, 8}, has degree 4
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 9, 3}, has degree 3
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7, 3, 5}, has degree 4
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 1, 2, 5, 8}, has degree 5
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 2, 6}, has degree 3
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 3, 2, 8, 0}, has degree 5
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 9, 5, 1, 0}, has degree 5
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 0, 2, 8}, has degree 4
- Node 8: neighbors {7, 3, 5, 0}, has degree 4
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 3, 1}, has degree 3

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 1: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 2: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 3: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 5: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 6: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 7: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 8: [C(4, 3)] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43

So the final answer is [43]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (4, 7, 3)>, <3, (9, 1, 5)>, <5, (6, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <8, (7, 3, 5)>.
