Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 56 + 20 = 105

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [105].

Unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (9, 7, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (9, 5, 6)>
