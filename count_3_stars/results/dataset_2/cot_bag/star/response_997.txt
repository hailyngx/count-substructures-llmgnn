Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors: node 1, node 3, and node 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 12
- Total number of 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 12
- Total number of 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 8, 12)>
- <3, (0, 1, 12)>
- <10, (2, 5, 7)>
