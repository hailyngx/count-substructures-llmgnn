Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: node 5, node 4, and node 0.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 10, 7, 14) -> there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) possible 3-stars.
<5, (0, 10, 7)>, <5, (0, 10, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>, <5, (10, 7, 14)>

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors (7, 12, 6, 2) -> there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) possible 3-stars.
<4, (7, 12, 6)>, <4, (7, 12, 2)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (12, 6, 2)>

For node 0:
There are 5 neighbors (5, 2, 14, 11, 8) -> there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) possible 3-stars.
<0, (5, 2, 14)>, <0, (5, 2, 11)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <0, (5, 14, 11)>, <0, (5, 14, 8)>, <0, (5, 11, 8)>, <0, (2, 14, 11)>, <0, (2, 14, 8)>, <0, (2, 11, 8)>, <0, (14, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 4 + 10 = 18\).
So, the final answer is [18].
