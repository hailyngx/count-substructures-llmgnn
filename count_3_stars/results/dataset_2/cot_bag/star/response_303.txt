Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 9, 2
- Node 1: 7, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7, 6, 8, 0, 5
- Node 3: 4, 0, 9, 8
- Node 4: 7, 9, 3, 2
- Node 5: 7, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 9, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 2, 5, 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 2, 5
- Node 9: 4, 3, 6, 0

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with more than 3 neighbors = 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 0)>, <0, (2, 6, 0)>, <0, (2, 9, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 0)>, <3, (4, 9, 0)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <5, (7, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 3, 6)>
