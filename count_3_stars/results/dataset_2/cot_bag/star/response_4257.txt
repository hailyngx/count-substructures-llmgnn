Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 11) (21, 18) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 4) (28, 21) (28, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 29) (27, 16) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 0) (15, 29) (15, 24) (15, 2) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 23) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 20) (16, 27) (16, 26) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 9) (20, 14) (20, 26) (20, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 21) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 10) (24, 15) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph are node 9, node 7, node 21, node 17, node 22, node 13, node 4, and node 10. Since they each have at least three neighbors, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:

- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <9, (6, 22, 25)>, <9, (22, 25, 20)>, <9, (18, 25, 20)>, <9, (25, 20, 9)>.
  
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <7, (21, 13, 23)>, <7, (21, 13, 26)>, <7, (21, 23, 7)>, <7, (21, 18, 11)>.
  
- For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <21, (7, 18, 11)>, <21, (7, 18, 28)>, <21, (7, 28, 3)>, <21, (18, 11, 21)>.
  
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
  Unique 3-star: <17, (3, 14, 4)>.
  
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <22, (9, 25, 20)>, <22, (9, 25, 29)>, <22, (9, 25, 5)>, <22, (25, 20, 22)>.
  
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <13, (7, 5, 0)>, <13, (7, 5, 10)>, <13, (7, 5, 13)>, <13, (5, 0, 13)>.
  
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <4, (6, 10, 29)>, <4, (6, 17, 10)>, <4, (6, 17, 29)>, <4, (17, 10, 4)>.
  
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  Unique 3-stars: <10, (13, 4, 8)>, <10, (13, 4, 10)>, <10, (13, 4, 1)>, <10, (13, 4, 2)>, <10, (13, 1, 10)>, <10, (13, 2, 10)>, <10, (4, 1, 10)>, <10, (4, 8, 10)>, <10, (1, 8, 10)>, <10, (1, 2, 10)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 35 \]

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in this graph.
