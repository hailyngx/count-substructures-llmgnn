Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.
For node 3: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
For node 4: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
For node 5: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5.
For node 6: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.
For node 7: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.
For node 8: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
For node 10: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10.
For node 11: There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 11.
For node 12: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars with node 12.
For node 14: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up all these 3-stars, we get a total of 71 3-stars [71].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (1, 3, 11)>, <1, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 11)>, <3, (3, 7, 11)>, <4, (4, 9, 10)>, <4, (4, 5, 10)>, <5, (0, 6, 14)>, <5, (2, 4, 10)>, <6, (5, 14, 8)>, <7, (6, 1, 3)>, <8, (12, 7, 8)>, <10, (2, 4, 13)>, <11, (0, 1, 7)>
