Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 15) (9, 13) (9, 1) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 27) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 8) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 25) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 28) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 8) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 12) (11, 23) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 15) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 12) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 21) (8, 28) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 25) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 19) (18, 29) (18, 23) (14, 13) (14, 20) (14, 6) (24, 5) (24, 3) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 2) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 6, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 20:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 21:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 22:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 23:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 25:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 26:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 29:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the final result is [30].
