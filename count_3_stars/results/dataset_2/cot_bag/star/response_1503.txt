Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 68 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [68].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 11, 13)> 
<0, (8, 12, 13)>
<1, (3, 4, 14)> 
<3, (1, 4, 14)> 
<3, (7, 11, 12)> 
<4, (1, 3, 14)> 
<5, (6, 8, 10)> 
<6, (2, 4, 7)> 
<7, (1, 3, 8)> 
<8, (0, 10, 12)> 
<10, (5, 8, 12)> 
<11, (0, 2, 13)> 

These are all the unique 3-stars in the graph.
