Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 5) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 11, 8, 12, 4, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 0.
- The unique 3-stars centered at node 0 are: <0, (11, 8, 12)>, <0, (11, 4, 9)>, <0, (11, 12, 4)>, <0, (11, 4, 9)>, <0, (8, 12, 4)>, <0, (8, 4, 9)>, <0, (12, 4, 9)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 3, 1, 2, 0, 5, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.
- The unique 3-stars centered at node 4 are: <4, (3, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 1, 0)>, <4, (3, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>, <4, (3, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 2, 9)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (3, 0, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 0, 5)>, <4, (1, 0, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 0, 5)>, <4, (2, 0, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 3, 8, 4, 13, 0, and 5.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars centered at node 9.
- The unique 3-stars centered at node 9 are: <9, (3, 8, 4)>, <9, (3, 8, 13)>, <9, (3, 8, 0)>, <9, (3, 8, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 13)>, <9, (3, 4, 0)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 13, 0)>, <9, (3, 13, 5)>, <9, (3, 0, 5)>, <9, (8, 4, 13)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 5)>, <9, (8, 13, 0)>, <9, (8, 13, 5)>, <9, (8, 0, 5)>, <9, (4, 13, 0)>, <9, (4, 13, 5)>, <9, (4, 0, 5)>, <9, (13, 0, 5)>.

There are in total 10 + 20 + 20 = 50 3-stars in the graph.
