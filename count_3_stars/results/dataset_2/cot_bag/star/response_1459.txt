- Node 24 is connected to nodes 21, 7, 10.
- Node 25 is connected to node 0.
- Node 26 is connected to node 11.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 22, 5.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 19, 21, 7, 2.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 19, 12, 23.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 28, 29

Total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{0}{3}  + \binom{1}{3} + 1 + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3} ] \]

\[ = [ 0 + 1 + 1 + 84 + 120 + 165 + 286 + 364 + 816 + 1140 + 1540 + 364 + 2925 ] \]

\[ = [ 7481 ] \]

Therefore, there are a total of 7481 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
