Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7

We will now check each node for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = [56] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
