Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
