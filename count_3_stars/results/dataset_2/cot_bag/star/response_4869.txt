Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 4) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three neighbors: Node 6 and Node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars formed with Node 6 as the central node:
<6, (9, 0, 13)>, <6, (8, 9, 13)>, <6, (0, 8, 13)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars formed with Node 9 as the central node:
<9, (6, 8, 13)>, <9, (4, 10, 0)>, <9, (10, 7, 13)>, <9, (11, 0, 7)>, <9, (14, 11, 7)>, <9, (4, 11, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 13)>, <9, (6, 0, 13)>, <9, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10] = 14.
