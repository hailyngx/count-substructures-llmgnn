Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 84 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 8, 12)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 13)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 10, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<12, (0, 6, 9)>
