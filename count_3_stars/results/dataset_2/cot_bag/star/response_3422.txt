Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 1, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 6, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 9, 7, 0, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
