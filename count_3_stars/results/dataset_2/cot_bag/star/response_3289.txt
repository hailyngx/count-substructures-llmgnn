Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 114\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [114].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, (5, 11, 3)>
2. <1, (9, 4, 12)>
3. <3, (5, 1, 13)>
4. <4, (1, 12, 2)>
5. <6, (5, 10, 2)>
6. <9, (5, 10, 1)>
7. <10, (9, 11, 6)>
8. <11, (3, 10, 14)>
9. <12, (9, 1, 4)>
