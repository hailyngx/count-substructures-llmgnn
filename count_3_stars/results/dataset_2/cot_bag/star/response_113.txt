Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 6: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 13) => [1]
   3-star: <6, (5, 7, 13)>

2. Node 9: 4 neighbors (8, 0, 12, 8) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   3-stars: <9, (8, 0, 12)>, <9, (0, 12, 8)>, <9, (12, 8, 0)>, <9, (8, 12, 8)>

3. Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 10, 12, 8) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <1, (3, 10, 12)>, <1, (3, 12, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 10, 12)>, <1, (5, 12, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 3)>, <1, (10, 12, 8)>, <1, (10, 8, 5)>, <1, (12, 8, 3)>

4. Node 3: 6 neighbors (1, 11, 7, 10, 4, 8) => [inom{6}{3}] = 20
   3-stars: <3, (1, 11, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 10)>, <3, (1, 10, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 11)>, <3, (11, 7, 10)>, <3, (11, 10, 4)>, <3, (11, 4, 8)>, <3, (11, 8, 1)>, <3, (7, 10, 4)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 11)>, <3, (10, 4, 8)>, <3, (10, 8, 11)>, <3, (4, 8, 1)>, <3, (4, 8, 11)>, <3, (4, 8, 11)>, <3, (8, 11, 7)>, <3, (8, 11, 1)>, <3, (8, 1, 7)>

5. Node 10: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 11, 4, 5) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   3-stars: <10, (1, 3, 11)>, <10, (1, 11, 4)>, <10, (1, 4, 5)>, <10, (3, 11, 4)>, <10, (3, 4, 5)>, <10, (11, 4, 5)>, <10, (4, 5, 1)>, <10, (4, 5, 3)>, <10, (4, 5, 11)>, <10, (5, 1, 3)>

6. Node 5: 5 neighbors (6, 1, 10, 12, 0) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 10)>, <5, (6, 10, 12)>, <5, (6, 12, 0)>, <5, (1, 10, 12)>, <5, (1, 12, 0)>, <5, (1, 0, 6)>, <5, (10, 12, 0)>, <5, (10, 0, 6)>, <5, (12, 0, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 1)>

7. Node 0: 4 neighbors (9, 5, 2, 8) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   3-stars: <0, (9, 5, 2)>, <0, (9, 2, 8)>, <0, (9, 8, 5)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>

8. Node 12: 5 neighbors (9, 1, 5, 14, 13) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   3-stars: <12, (9, 1, 5)>, <12, (9, 5, 14)>, <12, (9, 14, 13)>, <12, (1, 5, 14)>, <12, (1, 14, 13)>, <12, (5, 14, 13)>, <12, (14, 13, 9)>, <12, (14, 9, 1)>, <12, (14, 1, 5)>, <12, (14, 5, 13)>

9. Node 7: 3 neighbors (6, 3, 8) => [1]
   3-stars: <7, (6, 3, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 70

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
