Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 25) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 5) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 19) (10, 23) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (28, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 14) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 1) (7, 25) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 22) (22, 26) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 21) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 18) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 11) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 15) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 3) (13, 19) (24, 15) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 24) (27, 6) (23, 10) (23, 17) (23, 14) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 23) (5, 20) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's find the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 26), (9, 18), (9, 25), (9, 19)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <9, (26, 18, 25)>, <9, (26, 18, 19)>, <9, (26, 25, 19)>, <9, (18, 25, 19)>

2. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: (26, 9), (26, 22), (26, 20), (26, 25)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <26, (9, 22, 20)>, <26, (9, 22, 25)>, <26, (9, 20, 25)>, <26, (22, 20, 25)>

3. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: (20, 26), (20, 17), (20, 5), (20, 17)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <20, (26, 17, 5)>

4. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: (25, 9), (25, 26), (25, 7), (25, 19)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <25, (9, 7, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars is 16. So, we write the final answer as [16].
