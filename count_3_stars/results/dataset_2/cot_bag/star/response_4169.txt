Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 22) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 17) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 18) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 24) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 16) (8, 16) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (26, 18) (26, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 20) (25, 7) (25, 23) (9, 7) (9, 2) (20, 5) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 10) (29, 12) (29, 24) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (19, 21) (19, 18) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 28) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 15) (24, 23) (24, 29) (14, 22) (14, 20) (10, 27) (10, 6) (10, 20) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 2) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 16) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 17, 22
- Node 1: 28
- Node 2: 9, 10, 11, 17, 22
- Node 3: 0, 6, 12, 13
- Node 4: 16, 18, 22
- Node 5: 7, 13, 20, 26
- Node 6: 3, 10, 15, 28
- Node 7: 5, 9, 11, 25
- Node 8: 16
- Node 9: 2, 7
- Node 10: 2, 6, 20, 27
- Node 11: 2, 7, 13, 20
- Node 12: 3, 29
- Node 13: 3, 5, 11
- Node 14: 20, 22
- Node 15: 6, 16, 18
- Node 16: 4, 8, 15
- Node 17: 0, 2, 27
- Node 18: 4, 15, 16, 19, 21
- Node 19: 18, 21
- Node 20: 5, 10, 11, 14
- Node 21: 18, 19
- Node 22: 0, 2, 4, 14, 23
- Node 23: 22, 24, 25
- Node 24: 23, 29
- Node 25: 7, 23
- Node 26: 5, 18
- Node 27: 10, 17, 28
- Node 28: 1, 6, 27
- Node 29: 12, 24

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 18, Node 20, Node 22, Node 23, Node 27, and Node 28

For each of the identified nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 55 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are:
<0, (3, 17, 22)>, <2, (9, 11, 17)>, <2, (10, 11, 22)>, <2, (10, 17, 27)>, <2, (10, 20, 27)>, <2, (11, 13, 20)>, <2, (11, 20, 27)>, <3, (6, 12, 29)>, <4, (16, 18, 22)>, <5, (7, 11, 20)>, <5, (11, 13, 20)>, <6, (10, 20, 27)>, <15, (16, 18, 19)>, <18, (19, 21, 22)>, <18, (19, 21, 27)>, <18, (19, 21, 28)>, <18, (19, 21, 29)>, <18, (19, 22, 23)>, <18, (19, 22, 26)>, <18, (19, 27, 28)>, <19, (21, 22, 23)>, <22, (14, 20, 23)>, <22, (14, 20, 25)>, <22, (14, 20, 26)>, <22, (14, 20, 27)>, <22, (14, 23, 25)>, <22, (14, 23, 28)>, <22, (14, 25, 28)>, <22, (23, 25, 28)>.
