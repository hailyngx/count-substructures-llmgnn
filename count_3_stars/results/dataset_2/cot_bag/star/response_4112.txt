This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 1) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 26) (27, 7) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 28) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 20) (9, 27) (9, 11) (22, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 4) (17, 19) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 10) (11, 9) (11, 22) (11, 18) (23, 21) (23, 29) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 2) (14, 10) (26, 0) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 15) (3, 6) (3, 28) (29, 7) (29, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (12, 0) (12, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 10) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 25) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 25) (16, 20) (20, 6) (20, 28) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 16) (24, 13) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 12) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 12, 21)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (6, 14, 27, 2)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (6, 28)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 17)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (4, 16, 19)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 13, 20, 28)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 27, 29)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (13, 14, 16, 25)
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (9, 18, 22)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (2, 10, 20, 26)
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors (16, 26)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (5, 15, 20, 25)
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (12, 18, 21, 28)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors (5, 10, 17)
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (6, 14, 16, 28)
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors (0, 18, 23, 25)
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (14, 15, 26, 27)
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors (2, 7, 26, 29)
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors (3, 6, 18, 20, 28)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

Unique 3-star configurations in the graph are:
