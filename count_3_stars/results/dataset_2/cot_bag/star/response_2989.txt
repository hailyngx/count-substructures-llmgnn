Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 10) (12, 7) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 10) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: There are 5 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
The unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center are <0, (5, 15, 19)> and <0, (5, 17, 15)>.
For node 1: There are 5 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center are <1, (4, 16, 19)> and <1, (4, 10, 19)>.
For node 2: There are 3 edges incident with this node. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.
The unique 3-star with node 2 as the center is <2, (9, 3, 17)>.
For node 4: There are 3 edges incident with this node. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
The unique 3-star with node 4 as the center is <4, (8, 1, 19)>.
For node 6: There are 3 edges incident with this node. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
The unique 3-star with node 6 as the center is <6, (17, 11, 18)>.
For node 7: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center are <7, (15, 14, 0)> and <7, (15, 12, 7)>.
For node 8: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center are <8, (4, 10, 19)> and <8, (4, 8, 10)>.
For node 9: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center are <9, (16, 13, 9)> and <9, (16, 13, 15)>.
For node 10: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 10 as the center are <10, (5, 1, 8)> and <10, (5, 10, 1)>.
For node 11: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 11 as the center are <11, (6, 18, 17)> and <11, (6, 11, 17)>.
For node 13: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 13 as the center are <13, (15, 11, 9)> and <13, (15, 11, 13)>.
For node 15: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 15 as the center are <15, (7, 0, 13)> and <15, (7, 15, 13)>.
For node 16: There are 4 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 16 as the center are <16, (9, 18, 16)> and <16, (9, 1, 18)>.
For node 17: There are 5 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 17 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 17 as the center are <17, (0, 2, 11)> and <17, (0, 6, 11)>.
For node 18: There are 5 edges incident with this node. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 18 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with node 18 as the center are <18, (6, 11, 14)> and <18, (6, 11, 18)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, there are in total 88 3-stars [(10+10+1+1+1+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+10+10+10)].
