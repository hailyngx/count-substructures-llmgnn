Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 14) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 28) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (3, 0) (28, 23) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 3) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 14) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 12) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 16) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 6) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 9) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 28) (24, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are several nodes with only two neighbors, so we can start by identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 52 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets is [52].
