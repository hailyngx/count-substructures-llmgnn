Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 11) (11, 26) (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 17) (16, 18) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 20) (21, 22) (18, 16) (18, 22) (18, 12) (18, 3) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 24) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 19) (13, 12) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 8) (20, 21) (20, 1) (29, 4) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 25) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 25) (23, 5) (23, 27) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 25) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 0) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (2, 26) (2, 4) (25, 12) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 19) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  

1: {6, 20}  
2: {4, 26}  
3: {0, 9, 15, 18, 24}  
4: {2, 29}  
5: {0, 5, 7, 23, 25}  
6: {1, 27, 28}  
7: {5, 14, 19, 21}  
8: {10, 14, 28}  
9: {3, 14, 26}  
10: {8, 17, 21}  
11: {16, 26, 27}  
12: {13, 18, 25}  
13: {12}  
14: {7, 8, 9}  
15: {3, 24}  
16: {11, 17, 18, 28}  
17: {10, 16, 19}  
18: {3, 12, 16, 22}  
19: {7, 17, 25}  
20: {1, 21}  
21: {7, 10, 20, 22}  
22: {18, 21, 27}  
23: {5, 27}  
24: {0, 3, 15}  
25: {5, 12, 19, 1}  
26: {2, 11, 9}  
27: {6, 11, 22, 23}  
28: {6, 8, 16}  
29: {4}  

Now we can count the number of 3-stars formed:  
Node 3: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$  
Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$  
Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  
Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$  
Node 11: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$  
Node 12: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$  
Node 14: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$  
Node 16: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  
Node 18: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  
Node 21: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  
Node 22: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$  
Node 25: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  
Node 27: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$  

Summing them up: $10+10+4+1+1+1+1+4+4+4+1+4+4 = 48$

So, there are a total of 48 different 3-stars in this graph.   
Hence, the final answer is [48].  
Here are the unique 3-stars:

<3, (0, 15, 3)>  
<3, (0, 24, 3)>
