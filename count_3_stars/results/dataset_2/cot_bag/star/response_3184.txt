Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 21) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 4) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 20) (13, 23) (20, 13) (20, 5) (17, 2) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 19) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 14) (1, 17) (1, 23) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 27) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 26) (18, 26) (18, 24) (26, 3) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 28) (21, 29) (21, 8) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 24) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 12) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 20) (7, 27) (12, 28) (12, 23) (12, 14) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 28) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 3, node 10, node 25, and node 27. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets: [20]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (29, 11, 17)>
<3, (10, 25, 6)>
<10, (3, 27, 4)>
<25, (22, 0, 25)>
<27, (4, 7, 26)>
<27, (8, 10, 27)>
<27, (26, 27, 18)>
<27, (27, 4, 10)>
<27, (27, 8, 4)>
<27, (27, 10, 7)>
