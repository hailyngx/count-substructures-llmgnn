Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph. Here are the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 11}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 12, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 13}

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 13, 14)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 11)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 11, 12)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (8, 9, 14)>
<11, (4, 7, 12)>
<12, (7, 10, 13)>
<13, (0, 12, 14)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
