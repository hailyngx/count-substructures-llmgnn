Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 29) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (11, 7) (11, 23) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 6) (15, 20) (15, 24) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 10) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (13, 5) (13, 20) (13, 2) (29, 21) (29, 10) (29, 12) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 26) (27, 16) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 24) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 1) (12, 29) (12, 16) (12, 17) (16, 27) (16, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
\( 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 121 \)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [121]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 18, 22)> <0, (9, 18, 17)> <0, (9, 22, 0)> <0, (18, 22, 0)> <2, (10, 19, 28)> <2, (10, 19, 25)> <2, (10, 28, 6)> <2, (10, 28, 24)> <3, (4, 7, 23)> <4, (7, 21, 29)> <6, (7, 20, 13)> <7, (4, 21, 19)> <7, (21, 19, 29)> <10, (19, 25, 1)> <12, (29, 16, 27)> <13, (5, 20, 2)> <14, (23, 26, 1)> <17, (18, 19, 10)> <19, (21, 29, 12)> <24, (7, 15, 20)> <27, (26, 16, 12)>
