Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 9) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 8) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for that node

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4*3 + 4*4 + 4*4 + 4*4 + 10*1 + 4*4 + 4*4 + 4*4 + 3*1 + 4*4 = 100 \)

So, there are a total of [100] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <1, (4, 7, 17)>
- <7, (1, 11, 17)>
- <10, (4, 6, 17)>
- <11, (7, 14, 17)>
- <12, (3, 9, 15)>
- <13, (2, 7, 12)>
- <15, (5, 9, 19)>
- <16, (6, 8, 9)>
- <17, (1, 10, 11)>
- <19, (3, 18, 15)>
