Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: (9, 4, 8, 12)
- Node 2: (6, 3, 10, 13, 12)
- Node 3: (6, 11, 7, 2)
- Node 4: (1, 11, 8, 0)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 11, 13, 14)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 14, 0)
- Node 12: (5, 10, 8, 0, 2, 14)
- Node 14: (9, 8, 13, 7, 12)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56\)

Hence, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 8, 12)>, <2, (3, 10, 13)>, <3, (6, 7, 11)>, <4, (0, 8, 11)>, 
<7, (1, 11, 13)>, <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <12, (5, 8, 10)>, <13, (7, 14, 2)>
