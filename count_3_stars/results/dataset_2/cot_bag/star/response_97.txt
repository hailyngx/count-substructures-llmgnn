Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 or 5 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 10 = 14 \) 3-stars are formed with each of these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [14 \times 12] = 168 \).

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 12, 5)>
<1, (8, 6, 13)>
<2, (8, 14, 5)>
<3, (11, 4, 12)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<5, (10, 0, 14)>
<6, (13, 0, 3)>
<7, (9, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 9, 2)>
<9, (4, 13, 7)>
<10, (12, 5, 0)>
<11, (3, 14, 7)>
<12, (10, 0, 3)>
<13, (6, 4, 14)>
<14, (11, 5, 2)> 

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
