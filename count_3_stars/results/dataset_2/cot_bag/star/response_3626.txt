Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {9, 3, 8, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 6, 1, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 8, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 7, 2, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {8, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars. So, we will write [50] as the final count.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 8, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 1)>
<5, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (8, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
