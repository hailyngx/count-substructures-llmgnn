Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {9, 4, 7, 2, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 9, 6, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 7, 6, 0}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 1, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {9, 4, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 6, 2, 0}

Now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 66

So, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 4, 7)>, 
<0, (9, 4, 2)>, 
<0, (9, 7, 3)>, 
<0, (4, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (4, 1, 6)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 2)>, 
<1, (6, 2, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 8, 1)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 0)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 1)>.
