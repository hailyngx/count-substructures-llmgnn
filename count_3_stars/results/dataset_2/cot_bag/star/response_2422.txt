Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are node 6, node 9, node 4, node 7, node 8, and node 5. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <6, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 4)>, <9, (8, 7, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <4, (9, 8, 5)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (6, 9, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <8, (9, 4, 5)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (6, 8, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in this graph and we have listed the unique 3-stars above.
