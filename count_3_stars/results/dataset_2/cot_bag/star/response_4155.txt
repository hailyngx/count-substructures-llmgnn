Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

1: {9, 19, 6}
2: {12, 16, 15}
3: {14, 10, 12}
4: {5, 7, 0}
5: {4, 16}
6: {1, 8, 0}
7: {4, 14}
8: {10, 11, 6}
9: {1, 13}
10: {17, 3, 11, 8}
11: {10, 19, 8, 15}
12: {2, 13, 3, 8}
13: {9, 12, 16}
14: {7, 17, 3}
15: {11, 2}
16: {5, 2, 18, 13}
17: {14, 10, 0}
18: {16, 0}
19: {11, 1}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{2}{3} = 0

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 30
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 19, 6)>
<2, (12, 16, 15)>
<3, (14, 10, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (10, 11, 6)>
<10, (17, 3, 11)>
<11, (10, 19, 15)>
<12, (2, 13, 3)>
<13, (9, 16, 12)>
<14, (7, 17, 3)>
<16, (5, 2, 18)>
