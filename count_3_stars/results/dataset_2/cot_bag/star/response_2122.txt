Node 7 has 2 neighbors
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: (13, 25), (8, 25), (26, 25)
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (6, 19), (28, 19), (18, 19), (4, 19)
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (0, 18), (7, 18), (19, 18), (12, 18)
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (22, 10), (28, 10), (26, 10)
Node 26 has 5 neighbors: (17, 26), (20, 26), (25, 26), (10, 26), (27, 26)
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (23, 9), (11, 9), (27, 9)
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (5, 2), (16, 2), (24, 2)
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (14, 5), (2, 5), (21, 5)
Node 16 has 1 neighbor
Node 24 has 1 neighbor
Node 27 has 4 neighbors: (26, 27), (9, 27), (21, 27), (29, 27)
Node 29 has 2 neighbors
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (8, 15), (14, 15), (29, 15)
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (23, 4), (14, 4), (19, 4)
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: (14, 21), (5, 21), (27, 21), (4, 21)
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (3, 12), (11, 12), (18, 12), (21, 12)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + [inom{4}{3}] + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + [inom{4}{3}] + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].
