Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 4) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 7) (17, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 14) (14, 16) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<0, (18, 1, 6)>

For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
<1, (4, 13, 16)>
<1, (4, 13, 0)>
<1, (13, 18, 16)>
<1, (16, 18, 0)>

For node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
<2, (8, 17, 9)>
<2, (8, 17, 2)>
<2, (17, 18, 9)>
<2, (17, 18, 16)>

For node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<3, (8, 5, 14)>

For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
<4, (1, 10, 15)>
<4, (1, 10, 7)>
<4, (7, 15, 16)>
<4, (7, 15, 10)>

For node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<6, (15, 0, 19)>

For node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
<7, (4, 16, 19)>
<7, (4, 16, 17)>
<7, (17, 16, 2)>
<7, (17, 16, 19)>

For node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
<8, (3, 11, 13)>
<8, (3, 11, 2)>
<8, (2, 11, 17)>
<8, (2, 11, 3)>

For node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<13, (1, 18, 8)>

For node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<15, (16, 4, 6)>

For node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
<16, (18, 1, 7)>
<16, (18, 1, 15)>
<16, (18, 1, 16)>
<16, (18, 15, 17)>
<16, (18, 15, 16)>
<16, (18, 7, 19)>
<16, (18, 7, 16)>
<16, (18, 19, 7)>
<16, (18, 19, 6)>
<16, (19, 18, 7)>

For node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
<18, (13, 1, 16)>
<18, (13, 1, 0)>
<18, (13, 1, 18)>
<18, (13, 16, 7)>
<18, (13, 16, 15)>
<18, (13, 16, 18)>
<18, (13, 0, 18)>
<18, (13, 0, 1)>
<18, (13, 0, 16)>
<18, (13, 18, 16)>

For node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
<19, (7, 6, 18)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [45].
