- Node 11: 1, 3, 11, 15
- Node 12: 5, 10, 11

Based on the given information, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For each node with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 10: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 18: 2 neighbors, less than 3, no 3-star
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 16)>, <2, (0, 1, 17)>, <3, (5, 11, 13)>, <5, (0, 3, 12)>, <6, (3, 4, 16)>, <8, (9, 10, 16)>, <9, (8, 13, 17)>, <10, (8, 12, 14)>, <11, (1, 3, 15)>, <13, (3, 4, 7)>, <16, (0, 6, 8)>, <19, (4, 5, 6)>
