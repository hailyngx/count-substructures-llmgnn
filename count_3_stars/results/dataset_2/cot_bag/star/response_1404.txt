Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (18, 3) (18, 13) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 3) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (19, 13) (19, 16) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 15, 16, and 17.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

So, there are a total of 45 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 16, 17)>, <1, (10, 16, 17)>, <1, (4, 16, 10)>, <1, (10, 11, 17)>, <3, (7, 12, 18)>, <3, (7, 17, 18)>, <3, (7, 11, 18)>, <3, (12, 17, 18)>, <4, (1, 8, 15)>, <4, (1, 5, 15)>, <4, (8, 0, 15)>, <4, (8, 5, 15)>, <8, (0, 15, 16)>, <8, (0, 5, 15)>, <8, (5, 15, 16)>, <8, (0, 1, 15)>, <11, (2, 6, 9)>, <15, (4, 8, 9)>, <15, (5, 8, 9)>, <16, (0, 1, 2)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].
