Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 10 + 10] = 55 \).

The unique 3-stars identified in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 2)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 4)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 4)>
- <8, (7, 4, 5)>
