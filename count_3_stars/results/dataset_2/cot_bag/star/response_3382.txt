Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 27) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (12, 26) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 26) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 4) (28, 10) (28, 21) (28, 24) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 25) (26, 12) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 16) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 29) (25, 19) (25, 7) (3, 21) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 29) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 29) (2, 6) (2, 11) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 20) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 5) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 20) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 4) (0, 23) (0, 5) (0, 18) (13, 3) (13, 20) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 0) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 13) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are:  
Node 6 (with 3 neighbors), Node 14 (with 3 neighbors), Node 17 (with 3 neighbors), Node 21 (with 4 neighbors), Node 28 (with 3 neighbors), Node 26 (with 4 neighbors), Node 8 (with 5 neighbors), Node 29 (with 4 neighbors), Node 5 (with 5 neighbors), and Node 20 (with 4 neighbors).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
