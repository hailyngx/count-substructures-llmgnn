Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have at least 3 neighbors. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have at least 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 2)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 0)>

For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Adding all the 3-stars together: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].
