Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (17, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are three nodes with more than three neighbors: node 4, node 7, and node 3.

For node 4:
There are 3 edges incident to node 4: (4, 7), (4, 19), and (4, 3).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
Therefore, we have the 3-star <4, (7, 19, 3)>.

For node 7:
There are 4 edges incident to node 7: (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 8), and (7, 13).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
Therefore, we have the 3-stars <7, (4, 12, 8)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (12, 8, 13)>, and <7, (4, 8, 13)>.

For node 3:
There are 4 edges incident to node 3: (3, 4), (3, 9), (3, 11), and (3, 16).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
Therefore, we have the 3-stars <3, (4, 9, 11)>, <3, (4, 9, 16)>, <3, (4, 11, 16)>, and <3, (9, 11, 16)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, so the final answer is [9].
