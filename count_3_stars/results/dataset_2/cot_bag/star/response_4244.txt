Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 27) (8, 29) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 24) (4, 3) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 27) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 22) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 7) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 22) (25, 17) (25, 19) (10, 0) (10, 19) (26, 3) (26, 12) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 15) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 21) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (27, 9) (27, 20) (27, 23) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 1) (24, 23) (24, 14) (14, 24) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 21) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 17) (22, 16) (22, 28) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 26) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 61 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 20, 29>
<1, 11, 24>
<3, 4, 19>
<8, 12, 16>
<17, 20, 22>
<19, 21, 29>
<15, 23, 28>
<22, 27, 28>
<24, 13, 14>
