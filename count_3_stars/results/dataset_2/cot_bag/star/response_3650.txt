Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 34 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 5, 7)>.
