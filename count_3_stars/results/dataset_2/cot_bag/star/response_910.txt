Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 0) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 0) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 15) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 19) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32 \)

So, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 15, 4)>
<1, (0, 15, 10)>
<3, (7, 18, 9)>
<4, (15, 5, 19)>
<5, (4, 2, 17)>
<6, (7, 2, 11)>
<8, (11, 15, 8)>
<10, (1, 19, 13)>
<11, (8, 17, 6)>
<12, (16, 0, 17)>
<13, (10, 18, 9)>
<15, (0, 14, 4)>
<16, (0, 12, 19)>
<17, (11, 5, 12)>
<18, (13, 14, 3)>
<19, (16, 4, 10)>
