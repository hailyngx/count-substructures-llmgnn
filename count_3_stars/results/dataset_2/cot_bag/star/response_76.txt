Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 13, 3
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 9, 2, 13
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 14, 12, 0, 13
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 7, 6, 11, 10
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 5, 11, 12
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 8, 3
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, 5
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 6, 11, 3
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 7, 5, 1
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 14, 1
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 0, 14, 10
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 11, 5, 12
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 8, 0, 2, 1, 10
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 1
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, 5

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding up these values: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 13, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<5, (8, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 14, 13)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 13, 5)>
<9, (7, 6, 11)>
<11, (9, 8, 14)>
<13, (7, 8, 3)>
