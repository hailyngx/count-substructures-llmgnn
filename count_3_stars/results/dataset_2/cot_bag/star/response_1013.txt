Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Following the calculation for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors -> [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of 4 + 35 + 10 + 20 = 69 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [69].
