Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 3, 5, 11, 9
   - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
   - 3-stars: <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 11)>, <0, (4, 5, 3)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 11, 9)>

2. Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 6, 5, 10
   - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \)
   - 3-stars: <1, (4, 3, 7)>, <1, (4, 3, 10)>, <1, (4, 7, 10)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 10)>, <1, (7, 6, 10)>, <1, (3, 6, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 10)>, <1, (6, 5, 10)>

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 13, 14, 9, 10
   - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
   - 3-stars: <2, (3, 13, 14)>, <2, (3, 13, 9)>, <2, (3, 14, 9)>, <2, (13, 14, 9)>, <2, (13, 14, 10)>

4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 0, 14, 10, 2
   - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
   - 3-stars: <3, (1, 0, 14)>, <3, (1, 0, 10)>, <3, (1, 14, 10)>, <3, (0, 14, 10)>, <3, (0, 14, 2)>

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 12, 0, 10, 1
   - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars: <4, (12, 0, 10)>, <4, (12, 0, 1)>, <4, (12, 10, 1)>, <4, (0, 10, 1)>

6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 8, 5, 1
   - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 1 (only 3 neighbors)
   - 3-stars: <6, (8, 5, 1)>

7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 12, 14, 2, 0
   - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars: <9, (12, 14, 2)>, <9, (12, 14, 0)>, <9, (12, 2, 0)>, <9, (14, 2, 0)>

8. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 4, 1, 3, 8, 2
   - Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
   - 3-stars: <10, (4, 1, 3)>, <10, (4, 1, 8)>, <10, (4, 1, 2)>, <10, (4, 3, 8)>, <10, (4, 3, 2)>, <10, (1, 3, 8)>, <10, (1, 3, 2)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 60 3-stars [60].
