Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 9) (17, 15) (2, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 15) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

The 20 nodes are numbered from 0 to 19:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 10)
- (1, 0), (1, 10)
- (2, 6)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 10), (4, 11)
- (5, 0), (5, 12), (5, 14), (5, 18)
- (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 14)
- (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 15)
- (8, 3), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 18)
- (9, 7), (9, 13), (9, 17)
- (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 11)
- (11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 14)
- (12, 5), (12, 8), (12, 15), (12, 16)
- (13, 8), (13, 9), (13, 15)
- (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 11)
- (15, 7), (15, 12), (15, 13), (15, 17), (15, 19)
- (16, 12), (16, 18), (16, 19)
- (17, 9), (17, 15)
- (18, 5), (18, 8), (18, 16)
- (19, 15), (19, 16)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) calculation to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 12.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 15.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 16.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 35

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, 1, 10>
- <5, 0, 6>
- <8, 3, 13>
- <10, 1, 11>
- <11, 4, 14>
- <12, 5, 15>
- <15, 7, 19>
- <16, 18, 19>
