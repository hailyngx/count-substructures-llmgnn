Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{9}{3} = 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 84 + 20 + 84 = 272 \]

So, there are 272 total 3-stars in the given graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:

\[ <0, (5, 6, 11)>, <2, (6, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 8, 10)>, <6, (9, 1, 11)>, <8, (9, 4, 14)>, <10, (6, 4, 2)>, <11, (5, 6, 13)>, <12, (4, 13, 14)>, <14, (3, 8, 12)> \] 

Therefore, the final answer is [272].
