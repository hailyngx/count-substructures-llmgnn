Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 12, 4, 3, 14
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 12, 13
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 1, 0
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 13, 8
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 11, 7
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 10, 11
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 13, 4, 2, 0
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 8, 4
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 10, 8, 13
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 7, 12
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 2
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 2
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 0, 14
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 14
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 11, 12, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 5 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 1 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 contributes 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and they are:
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 9, 14>
<9, 1, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 11>
<5, 6, 12>
<8, 13, 4>
<13, 6, 4>
<4, 8, 10>
<11, 3, 7>
