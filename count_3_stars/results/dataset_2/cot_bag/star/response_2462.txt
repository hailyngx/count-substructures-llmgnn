Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
Applying the information given, we will list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 10
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8, 11
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 13, 14
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9, 10, 13
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9, 14
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 13, 14
- Node 9: 6, 7, 10, 11
- Node 10: 0, 6, 9, 11, 12
- Node 11: 1, 9, 10, 12
- Node 12: 10, 11
- Node 13: 5, 6, 8
- Node 14: 5, 7, 8

Now, we will find the total number of 3-stars using the formula stated earlier:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we find a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 80 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [80] and some unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <5, 13, 5>
- <5, 8, 13>
