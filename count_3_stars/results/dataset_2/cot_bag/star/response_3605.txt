Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph are nodes: 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 since each of these nodes has at least three neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.
2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 6.
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 8.
5. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 11.
6. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 12.
7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star centered at node 13.
8. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 15.
9. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star centered at node 16.
10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 17.
11. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 18.
12. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 19.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38 \]

Hence, there are 38 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars found are:
