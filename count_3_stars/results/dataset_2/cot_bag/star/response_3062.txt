Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 14) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 2) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars from the above nodes, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 30 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (4, 12, 15)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (14, 15, 18)>
<8, (13, 14, 15)>
<15, (13, 14, 18)>
