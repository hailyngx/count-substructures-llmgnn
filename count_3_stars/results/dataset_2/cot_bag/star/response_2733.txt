Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 6) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 13) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 1 neighbor
- Node 11: 1 neighbor
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 1 neighbor
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 has 4 or more neighbors. So, we need to calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of them.
- Node 1, 13 have 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for each of them.

Calculations for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing them up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \)

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (10, 16, 13)>
<1, (5, 12, 15)>
<3, (8, 13, 16)>
<4, (7, 8, 19)>
<6, (11, 15, 19)>
<13, (2, 15, 18)> 

So, the final answer is [60].
