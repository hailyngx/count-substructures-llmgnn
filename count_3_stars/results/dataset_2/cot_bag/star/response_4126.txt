Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 16) (10, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, which means they can be the center of a 3-star. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 14, 18, 12)
Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (1, 3, 14)>, <0, (1, 18, 12)>, <0, (1, 12, 14)>, <0, (3, 18, 12)>, <0, (3, 14, 12)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (7, 14, 15)
Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: 1
<2, (7, 14, 15)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (9, 19, 8, 12)
Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (9, 19, 8)>, <5, (9, 19, 12)>, <5, (9, 8, 12)>, <5, (19, 8, 12)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (11, 6, 4, 2)
Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (11, 6, 4)>, <7, (11, 6, 2)>, <7, (11, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>

Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (4, 14, 15)
Number of 3-stars with Node 13 as the center: 1
<13, (4, 14, 15)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20 3-stars formed in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
