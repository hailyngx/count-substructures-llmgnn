Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 17, 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
2. Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
3. Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
4. Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
5. Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
6. Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
7. Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
8. Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
9. Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 44

So, there are 44 3-stars in total, which we will represent as [44].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (1, 5, 3)>
<2, (14, 15, 2)>
<2, (10, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 10, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 0, 5)>
<6, (3, 10, 6)>
<6, (12, 10, 6)>
<6, (12, 4, 6)>
<6, (12, 3, 6)>
<12, (17, 13, 12)>
<12, (7, 17, 12)>
<12, (15, 7, 12)>
<12, (15, 14, 12)>
<13, (18, 9, 13)>
<13, (19, 18, 13)>
<13, (19, 9, 13)>
<13, (17, 19, 13)>
<17, (1, 13, 17)>
<17, (1, 12, 17)>
<18, (13, 19, 18)>
<18, (13, 9, 18)>
<18, (13, 17, 18)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [44]
