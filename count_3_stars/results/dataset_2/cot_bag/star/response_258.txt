Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 3-stars.

Adding these up: 2 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 2 = 25.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<2, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 5)>
