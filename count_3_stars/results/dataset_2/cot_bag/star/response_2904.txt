Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 17) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 27) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 28) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 21) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 13) (15, 12) (3, 20) (17, 22) (17, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 2) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (16, 18) (16, 29) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 13) (20, 18) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 12) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 7) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 29) (6, 14) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 20) (27, 21) (27, 28) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 24) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 19) (9, 1) (9, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 18, 22, 4, 8, 0, 14, 21, 28, 11, 1, 15, 20, 21, 25, 19, 22, 7, 16, 24, 23, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<18, (16, 17, 22)>, 
<22, (18, 17, 19)>, 
<4, (5, 8, 10)>, 
<8, (4, 11, 24)>, 
<0, (13, 14, 23)>, 
<21, (15, 25, 27)>, 
<28, (11, 21, 27)>, 
<11, (8, 18, 28)>, 
<1, (9, 10, 20)>, 
<15, (12, 13, 23)>, 
<20, (12, 20, 21)>, 
<25, (2, 10, 21)>, 
<19, (9, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<24, (12, 13, 24)>.
