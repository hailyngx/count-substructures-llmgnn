Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: neighbors {5, 4, 8}
Node 1: neighbors {5, 9, 3, 2, 8}
Node 2: neighbors {6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8}
Node 3: neighbors {4, 7, 1, 2}
Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 0, 3, 2}
Node 5: neighbors {9, 8, 1, 0}
Node 7: neighbors {9, 4, 3, 2}
Node 8: neighbors {5, 4, 1, 2, 0}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
Node 2: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
Node 3: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
Node 4: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
Node 5: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
Node 7: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
Node 8: [inom{5}{3} = 10]

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 63.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 63.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 1)>
<2, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 1, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
