Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 9, 1, 7, 0
- Node 4: 6, 9, 1, 8, 0
- Node 5: 6, 0, 7
- Node 6: 9, 5, 4, 0
- Node 7: 9, 3, 8, 5, 0
- Node 8: 4, 2, 7
- Node 9: 6, 4, 3, 7, 0

Based on the given graph, let's calculate the number of 3-stars. We'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up these, we get a total of 50 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (6, 4, 7)>, 
<0, (6, 4, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<0, (7, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 0, 7)>, 
<4, (6, 0, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 0, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 0, 9)>
