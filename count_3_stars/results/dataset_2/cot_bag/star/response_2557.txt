Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 29) (3, 26) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (25, 17) (25, 18) (25, 24) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 13) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 2) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 7) (19, 20) (19, 18) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 13) (18, 25) (18, 19) (18, 26) (2, 15) (2, 13) (22, 5) (22, 11) (16, 23) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (9, 27) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 10) (24, 25) (24, 0) (24, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 13) (23, 16) (23, 4) (23, 10) (4, 17) (4, 14) (4, 23) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 24) (10, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 20, 12, 27, 15, 25, 17, 29, 18, 5, 28, 13, 11, 14, 7, 0, 10, 24, 8, 22, 4, and 2.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
