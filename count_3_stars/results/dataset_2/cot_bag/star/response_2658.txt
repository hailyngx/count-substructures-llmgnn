Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 3, 10, 11, 4, 8, 7, 12, 2, 5, 13, 0, and 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Since there's only one 3-star for each node with exactly 3 neighbors, we don't need to include them in the count.

Adding up all the 3-stars we found:
\[ 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 78 \]

So, there are a total of 78 3-stars. Writing them in the requested format: 
\[ [78] \]
<6, (9, 12, 0)>, <9, (6, 12, 0)>, <1, (13, 4, 12)>, <3, (9, 14, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 2)>, <11, (10, 14, 8)>, <4, (1, 13, 5)>, <8, (11, 14, 2)>, <7, (6, 12, 0)>, <12, (6, 1, 11)>, <2, (9, 10, 11)>, <5, (6, 10, 4)>, <13, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <14, (9, 3, 11)>
