Response:
Given the provided information, let's first construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 4, 14, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 10
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 10, 11, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 12, 11, 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 10, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 11, 13, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 10, 7
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, 4, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, 5
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 0, 10
