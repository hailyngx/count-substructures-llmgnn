Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

1. For node 1: It has 4 neighbors (2, 13, 4, 12), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

2. For node 2: It has 6 neighbors (1, 7, 0, 12, 14, 11), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 2 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

3. For node 3: It has 3 neighbors (14, 8, 4), so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 3.

4. For node 4: It has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 13, 14), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

5. For node 5: It has 4 neighbors (7, 13, 11, 10), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

6. For node 7: It has 5 neighbors (4, 0, 11, 2, 5), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

7. For node 8: It has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 0, 12), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

8. For node 9: It has 4 neighbors (8, 11, 10, 13), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

9. For node 10: It has 4 neighbors (9, 5, 13, 0), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 10 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

10. For node 11: It has 5 neighbors (9, 7, 5, 0, 2), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 11 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

11. For node 12: It has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 2), so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 12.

12. For node 13: It has 6 neighbors (9, 1, 4, 5, 14, 10), so the total number of 3-stars formed with node 13 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

13. For node 14: It has 3 neighbors (3, 13, 2), so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get: 
\[ 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [83].
