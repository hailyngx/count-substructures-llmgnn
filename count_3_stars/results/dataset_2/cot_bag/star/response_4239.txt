Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 25) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 5) (2, 14) (2, 16) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 24) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 8) (21, 27) (21, 28) (28, 14) (28, 1) (28, 21) (13, 11) (13, 15) (26, 17) (26, 11) (5, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 24) (9, 17) (9, 29) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 7) (6, 17) (6, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (15, 4) (15, 13) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors


Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of the nodes listed above:

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <14, (17, 1, 28)>
- <17, (14, 29, 6)>
- <1, (3, 11, 16)>
- <3, (1, 10, 16)>
- <11, (1, 25, 26)>
- <20, (25, 29, 22)>
- <25, (11, 20, 25)>
- <27, (12, 19, 5)>
- <29, (14, 9, 24)>
