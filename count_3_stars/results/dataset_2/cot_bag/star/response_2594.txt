Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can go ahead and list the 3-stars formed in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 0.
<0, (6, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 1.
<1, (2, 7, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars with node 2.
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 3.
<3, (0, 6, 7)>

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 4.
<4, (2, 7, 0)>

6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 5.
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 6.
<6, (0, 3, 4)>

8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 7.
<7, (2, 4, 1)>

9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 8.
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars with node 9.
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [48].
