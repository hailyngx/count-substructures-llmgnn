Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 18) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 4) (15, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 18) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 4) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors: node 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 8: node 8 has 3 neighbors (13, 11, 17). Therefore, it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 10: node 10 has 4 neighbors (6, 3, 19, 9). Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 13: node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
4. Node 14: node 14 has 4 neighbors (7, 0, 16, 1). Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 16: node 16 has 4 neighbors (14, 3, 18, 9). Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 17: node 17 has 3 neighbors (8, 9, 18). Therefore, it forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 19: node 19 has 5 neighbors (10, 0, 5, 1, 16). Therefore, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 24 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (13, 11, 17)>, <10, (6, 3, 19)>, <14, (7, 0, 16)>, <16, (14, 3, 18)>, <19, (10, 0, 5)>, <19, (10, 1, 5)>, <19, (10, 1, 16)>, <19, (3, 1, 16)>, <19, (3, 5, 16)>, <19, (9, 1, 16)>, <19, (9, 5, 16)>, <19, (9, 3, 16)>, <19, (1, 5, 16)>
