Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 11) (6, 2) (9, 28) (9, 27) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 23) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 15) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 20) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 21) (3, 20) (23, 21) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 22) (24, 19) (24, 2) (22, 4) (22, 16) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 2) (20, 14) (20, 3) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 13) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 19) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 12) (26, 15) (26, 27) (27, 9) (27, 14) (27, 26) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 12) (25, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are:  
1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29  

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form and then sum them up:  

For node 1: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)   
For node 2: \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\)   
For node 4: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 5: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 7: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 8: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)   
For node 9: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 10: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)   
For node 11: \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\)   
For node 12: \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\)   
For node 13: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)   
For node 14: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 15: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)   
For node 16: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 17: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 18: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 20: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 21: \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\)   
For node 22: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)  
For node 23: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 24: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)   
For node 26: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)   
For node 27: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\)   
For node 28: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   
For node 29: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)   

Summing these up:  
\(3 + 10 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 3 + 15 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 10 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 99\) , so we have [99] 3-stars in total.  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (2, 16, 21)>  
<2, (1, 13, 20)>  
<4, (8, 15, 28)>  
<5, (15, 18, 23)>  
<7, (16, 18, 29)>  
<8, (4, 22, 29)>  
<9, (27, 28, 29)>  
<10, (11, 12, 20)>  
<11, (10, 21, 23)>  
<12, (10, 17, 19)>  
<13, (0, 2, 20)>  
<14, (0, 20, 27)>  
<15, (4, 5, 26)>  
<16, (1, 7, 22)>  
<17, (12, 17, 23)>  
<18, (5, 7, 17)>  
<20, (12, 13, 14)>  
<21, (1, 11, 23)>  
<22, (4, 16, 24)>  
<23, (5, 11, 17)>  
<24, (2, 19, 26)>  
<26, (12, 15, 27)>  
<27, (14, 26, 28)>  
<28, (9, 15, 29)>  
<29, (7, 9, 28)>
