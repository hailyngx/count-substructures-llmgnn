Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
  - Node 5 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 8 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 9 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 15 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 26 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 32 \). 

Therefore, there are a total of 32 3-stars in this graph, indicated inside brackets as [32]. Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (2, 25, 24)>
- <5, (2, 24, 22)>
- <5, (2, 24, 5)>
- <8, (13, 9, 21)>
- <8, (13, 9, 26)>
- <8, (13, 21, 26)>
- <9, (3, 18, 27)>
- <9, (3, 27, 12)>
- <9, (18, 11, 21)>
- <9, (18, 11, 27)>
- <9, (18, 21, 27)>
