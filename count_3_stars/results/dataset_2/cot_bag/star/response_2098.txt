Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 4), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 5, 7, 0, 1, 6)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 8, 2, 3)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 8)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 38 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 2, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>, <1, (4, 3, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (4, 3, 0)>, <5, (4, 3, 6)>, <5, (4, 0, 6)>, <4, (7, 3, 0)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <7, (3, 0, 6)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>
