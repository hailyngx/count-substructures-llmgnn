Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 16, 19)>, <2, (0, 4, 11)>, <2, (0, 4, 14)>, <2, (4, 11, 13)>, <3, (0, 9, 18)>, <4, (0, 2, 11)>, <4, (0, 2, 14)>, <4, (2, 11, 13)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 13, 14)>, <9, (3, 4, 18)>, <11, (4, 6, 13)>, <12, (10, 13, 18)>, <13, (6, 11, 12)>, <14, (5, 11, 18)>, <15, (5, 6, 19)>, <18, (3, 12, 14)>, <19, (1, 8, 16)>, <19, (1, 6, 17)>.
