Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 90

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [90].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 13, 14)>  
<0, (13, 14, 11)>  
<0, (14, 11, 2)>  
<0, (11, 2, 3)>  
<1, (9, 3, 7)>  
<1, (3, 7, 13)>  
<1, (7, 13, 6)>  
<1, (13, 6, 14)>  
<1, (6, 14, 10)>  
<3, (9, 1, 7)>  
<3, (1, 7, 13)>  
<3, (7, 13, 2)>  
<4, (9, 3, 10)>  
<4, (3, 10, 12)>  
<5, (9, 6, 10)>  
<5, (6, 10, 2)>  
<7, (1, 3, 13)>  
<9, (5, 6, 10)>  
<10, (5, 9, 6)>  
<13, (8, 7, 0)>  
<13, (7, 0, 14)>  
<13, (0, 14, 10)>  
<13, (14, 10, 4)>  
<14, (13, 0, 11)>
