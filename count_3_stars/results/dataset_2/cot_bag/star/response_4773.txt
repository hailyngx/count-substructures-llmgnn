Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 19) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 2) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 0) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (12, 13) (12, 18) (19, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the nodes:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 17, 0, 7).
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (5, 14).
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (15, 11, 7).
Node 15 has 4 neighbors (3, 14, 17, 2).
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (13, 11, 17).
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (5, 3, 19).
Node 10 has 2 neighbors (8, 14).
Node 17 has 4 neighbors (5, 15, 4, 2).
Node 6 has 1 neighbor (5).
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (15, 17, 8, 1, 13).
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (10, 2, 1, 18).
Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 14, 11).
Node 14 has 4 neighbors (9, 15, 10, 0).
Node 11 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 0, 1).
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 11).
Node 12 has 2 neighbors (13, 18).
Node 19 has 1 neighbor (7).
Node 13 has 4 neighbors (4, 2, 12, 18).
Node 18 has 3 neighbors (8, 12, 13).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 3: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 15: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 4: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 7: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 17: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 2: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 14: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 11: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 13: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 18: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node gives us a total of $10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48$. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[48]$.

List of unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 17)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 17, 0)>, <5, (6, 17, 0)>, <5, (6, 17, 7)>, <15, (3, 14, 17)>, <15, (3, 14, 2)>, <15, (3, 17, 2)>, <15, (14, 17, 2)>, <17, (5, 15, 4)>, <17, (5, 15, 2)>, <17, (5, 4, 2)>, <17, (15, 4, 2)>, <2, (15, 8, 1)>, <2, (15, 8, 13)>, <2, (15, 1, 13)>, <2, (8, 1, 13)>, <8, (10, 1, 18)>, <8, (10, 2, 1)>, <8, (10, 2, 18)>, <8, (2, 1, 18)>, <14, (9, 10, 0)>, <14, (9, 10, 15)>, <14, (9, 0, 15)>, <14, (10, 0, 15)>, <11, (3, 4, 0)>, <11, (3, 4, 1)>, <11, (3, 0, 1)>, <11, (4, 0, 1)>, <13, (4, 12, 18)>, <13, (4, 2, 12)>, <13, (4, 2, 18)>, <13, (12, 2, 18)>
