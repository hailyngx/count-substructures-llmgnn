Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 13) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 2) (4, 24) (4, 26) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (24, 4) (24, 19) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 22) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 7) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 20) (12, 1) (12, 23) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 27) (7, 18) (7, 15) (7, 27) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 16) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 29) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (19, 24) (19, 29) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 22) (1, 18) (1, 12) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 22) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 29) (22, 11) (27, 2) (27, 6) (27, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 5, 9, 3, 25, 17, 4, 18, 21, 24, 2, 26, 8, 13, 15, 14, 6, 7, 20, 0, 23, 29, 11, 22, 27, and 1.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 60 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].
