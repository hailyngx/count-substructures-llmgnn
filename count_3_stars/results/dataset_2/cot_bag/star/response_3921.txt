Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 28) (8, 20) (13, 21) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 25) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 28) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 24) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 23) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 24) (1, 19) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 21) (21, 13) (21, 6) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 20) (20, 8) (20, 4) (29, 23) (16, 0) (16, 28) (28, 15) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 16) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 18) (23, 0) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 7) (26, 12) (26, 23) (26, 7) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 26) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 14) (5, 17) (5, 25) (25, 10) (25, 5) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 1) (22, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's go through each one and count the number of 3-stars formed by that node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars formed.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars formed.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(1+4+1+4+1+1+1+1+10+4+10+4+4+1+1+4+1+1+4+1+1+4=51\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (13, 15, 16)>, <1, (12, 17, 19)>, <2, (6, 15, 24)>, <3, (10, 11, 15)>, <4, (19, 20, 24)>, <6, (2, 17, 21)>, <7, (11, 23, 26)>, <9, (13, 14, 15)>, <10, (11, 18, 22)>, <11, (3, 7, 23)>, <12, (1, 18, 26)>, <13, (0, 9, 21)>, <15, (3, 9, 28)>, <17, (1, 5, 6)>, <18, (10, 12, 19)>, <19, (1, 4, 18)>, <23, (0, 7, 26)>, <24, (1, 2, 4)>, <26, (12, 23, 7)>, <28, (12, 15, 16)>.
