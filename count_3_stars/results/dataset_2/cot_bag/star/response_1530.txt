Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 0, 5
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 at the center.
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 0)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>, <4, (1, 7, 5)>, <4, (1, 0, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <4, (6, 0, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors: 4, 2, 9, 0, 7, 1, 5
- There are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 5 at the center.
- <5, (4, 2, 9)>, <5, (4, 2, 0)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 1)>, <5, (4, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 9, 0)>, <5, (4, 9, 7)>, <5, (4, 9, 1)>, <5, (4, 9, 5)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 1)>, <5, (4, 0, 5)>, <5, (4, 7, 1)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (4, 1, 5)>, <5, (2, 9, 0)>, <5, (2, 9, 7)>, <5, (2, 9, 1)>, <5, (2, 9, 5)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 1)>, <5, (2, 0, 5)>, <5, (2, 7, 1)>, <5, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (2, 1, 5)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 1)>, <5, (9, 0, 5)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <5, (9, 7, 5)>, <5, (9, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 1)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (7, 1, 5)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 4, 2, 0
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 7 at the center.
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (9, 3, 4)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 2, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 0)>, <7, (3, 2, 0)>, <7, (4, 2, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found for nodes 4, 5, and 7, we get a total of 65 unique 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].
