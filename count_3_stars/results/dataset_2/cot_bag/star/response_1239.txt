Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on each node:

- Node 0: (0, 8), (0, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 18), (1, 10)
- Node 2: (2, 18), (2, 19), (2, 9), (2, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 11), (3, 17)
- Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 18), (5, 17)
- Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 10), (6, 19)
- Node 7: (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 10)
- Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 15)
- Node 10: (10, 7), (10, 1), (10, 6), (10, 14), (10, 16)
- Node 11: (11, 3), (11, 9)
- Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 16)
- Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 15), (13, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 16), (14, 10)
- Node 15: (15, 13), (15, 19), (15, 9), (15, 17)
- Node 16: (16, 12), (16, 14), (16, 19), (16, 10)
- Node 17: (17, 3), (17, 5), (17, 15)
- Node 18: (18, 2), (18, 5), (18, 1)
- Node 19: (19, 13), (19, 2), (19, 6), (19, 16), (19, 15)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms [6] 3-stars: <2, (18, 5, 1)>, <2, (18, 1, 10)>, <2, (19, 6, 4)>, <2, (19, 6, 10)>, <2, (19, 6, 16)>, <2, (19, 6, 14)>
- Node 3 forms [3] 3-stars: <3, (11, 9, 15)>, <3, (11, 9, 2)>, <3, (17, 5, 18)>
- Node 6 forms [1] 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 0)>
- Node 7 forms [1] 3-star: <7, (12, 16, 14)>
- Node 10 forms [1] 3-star: <10, (7, 0, 8)>
- Node 15 forms [2] 3-stars: <15, (13, 19, 2)>, <15, (13, 19, 6)>
- Node 16 forms [2] 3-stars: <16, (12, 7, 0)>, <16, (12, 7, 10)>
- Node 17 forms [1] 3-star: <17, (3, 11, 9)>
- Node 18 forms [1] 3-star: <18, (2, 19, 6)>
- Node 19 forms [2] 3-stars: <19, (13, 15, 9)>, <19, (13, 15, 17)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get a total of [19].
