Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {6, 8}
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {9, 3, 4, 8}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {9, 3, 8, 7}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 6, 2, 4}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 3, 2}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {9, 8, 7}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {3, 7, 8, 0}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 2}
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: {5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 0}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 2, 1}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 2 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes 4 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes 6 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (8, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 1)>
<2, (8, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 4)>
<3, (2, 8, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 3)>
<4, (2, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
