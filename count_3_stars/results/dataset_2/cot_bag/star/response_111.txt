Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (7, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 9, 8, 13, 14, 2, 1, 17, 11, 15, 12, 19, 16, 10.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{9}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{10}{3} = 84 \]

So, there are 84 3-stars in total.

Hence, the final answer is [84].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (12, 14, 10)>, 
<1, (15, 11, 17)>, 
<2, (8, 13, 11)>, 
<4, (12, 0, 19)>, 
<5, (9, 16, 17)>, 
<7, (9), (14), (16)>, 
<10, (8, 0, 1)>, 
<13, (8, 17, 3)>.
