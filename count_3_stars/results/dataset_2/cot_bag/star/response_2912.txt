Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 0: neighbors 9, 19, 11  
Node 1: neighbors 6, 17, 15, 16, 10  
Node 2: neighbors 18, 15, 7, 4  
Node 3: neighbors 8, 13, 12  
Node 4: neighbors 2, 8, 5  
Node 5: neighbors 4, 19, 12  
Node 7: neighbors 2, 17  
Node 8: neighbors 4, 12, 16, 3  
Node 9: neighbors 6, 17, 14, 0  
Node 11: neighbors 18, 17, 14, 0, 12  
Node 12: neighbors 8, 5, 11, 3  
Node 15: neighbors 2, 1  
Node 17: neighbors 9, 1, 11, 7  
Node 18: neighbors 2, 11  
Node 19: neighbors 5, 0, 13  

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 31 \)

So, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 19, 11)>
<1, (6, 17, 15)>
<1, (6, 17, 16)>
<1, (6, 17, 10)>
<1, (17, 15, 10)>
<2, (18, 15, 7)>
<2, (18, 15, 4)>
<2, (15, 7, 4)>
<2, (15, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 4, 2)>
<4, (8, 5, 12)>
<9, (6, 17, 14)>
<9, (6, 17, 0)>
<9, (17, 14, 0)>
<9, (17, 11, 14)>
<11, (18, 17, 14)>
<11, (18, 17, 0)>
<11, (18, 14, 0)>
<11, (17, 14, 0)>
<12, (5, 11, 3)>
<17, (1, 11, 7)>
<17, (16, 1, 7)>
<17, (16, 1, 11)>
<17, (1, 11, 7)>
<19, (5, 0, 13)>
