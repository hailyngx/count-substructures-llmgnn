Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (14, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

<3, (9, 0, 17)>
<6, (0, 15, 1)>
<7, (17, 15, 2)>
<8, (15, 12, 19)>
<9, (0, 12, 3)>
<10, (0, 15, 13)>
<11, (0, 16, 3)>
<12, (2, 9, 6)>
<13, (19, 15, 10)>
<15, (13, 8, 7)>
<16, (11, 1, 3)>
<17, (7, 3, 14)>
<19, (13, 8, 5)>
