Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes and sum them up:
Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph.
