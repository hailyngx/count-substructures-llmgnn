Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed with it.

For node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 1: Node 1 has 2 neighbors (0, 8). It cannot form any 3-star.

For node 2: Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>

For nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: These nodes have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each, but we have already calculated 3-stars involving these nodes earlier. So, they do not form any additional unique 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we have a total of 4 + 10 = 14 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
