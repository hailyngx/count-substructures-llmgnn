Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \(20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 100\), which we'll put inside brackets as [100].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 13)>
<1, (3, 9, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 10)>
<3, (12, 13, 0)>
<3, (1, 13, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 13)>
<4, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (13, 5, 10)>
<8, (7, 9, 14)>
<9, (0, 3, 12)>
<12, (0, 13, 14)>
<13, (5, 12, 0)>
<14, (5, 10, 6)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
