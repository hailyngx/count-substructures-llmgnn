Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 26) (2, 18) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 29) (7, 4) (7, 23) (18, 2) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 24) (22, 6) (22, 8) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 3) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 20) (9, 25) (9, 12) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 28) (0, 19) (28, 14) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 1) (16, 13) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 21) (27, 3) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 12) (13, 16) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 19) (1, 28) (1, 13) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 13) (20, 23) (20, 13) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 26) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 21) (26, 17) (26, 6) (26, 8) 

Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges in this graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (22, 8, 19, 26)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (29, 4, 23, 7)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (15, 27, 19, 23)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (17, 6, 9, 21)
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (16, 20, 1, 19)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (17, 27, 28, 14)
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (10, 8, 24, 15)
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: (10, 6, 25, 0, 13)
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: (25, 27, 12)
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (11, 4, 15, 0)
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: (9, 19, 21, 25)
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (6, 17, 8)
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: (14, 29, 10, 21, 3)
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: (5, 0, 1, 14)
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: (7, 27, 5)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (22, 8, 19, 26)>, <7, (29, 4, 23, 7)>, <10, (15, 27, 19, 23)>, <12, (17, 6, 9, 21)>, <13, (16, 20, 1, 19)>, <14, (17, 27, 28, 14)>, <15, (10, 8, 24, 15)>, <19, (10, 6, 25, 0, 13)>, <21, (25, 27, 12)>, <24, (11, 4, 15, 0)>, <25, (9, 19, 21, 25)>, <27, (14, 29, 10, 21, 3)>, <28, (5, 0, 1, 14)>.
