Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 13) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 20) (17, 22) (17, 29) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 16) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 10) (21, 29) (21, 3) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 26) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 25) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 15) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 12) (16, 26) (16, 25) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 20) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 5) (5, 29) (5, 20) (5, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (6, 4, 23)> 
<1, (6, 4, 8)> 
<1, (6, 7, 23)> 
<1, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<3, (27, 10, 21)>

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (7, 1, 24)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (4, 24, 8)> 
<7, (4, 24, 12)> 
<7, (4, 8, 1)> 
<7, (4, 8, 20)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (7, 4, 20)> 
<8, (7, 4, 1)> 
<8, (7, 24, 1)> 
<8, (7, 24, 12)>

For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<11, (19, 15, 26)>

For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<12, (25, 24, 2)> 
<12, (25, 24, 16)> 
<12, (25, 2, 20)> 
<12, (25, 2, 24)>

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<14, (9, 22, 26)>

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (22, 18, 11)> 
<15, (22, 18, 28)> 
<15, (22, 28, 5)> 
<15, (22, 11, 26)>

For node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<19, (26, 12, 11)>

For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<20, (27, 8, 5)> 
<20, (27, 8, 2)> 
<20, (27, 5, 28)> 
<20, (27, 5, 8)>

For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<22, (23, 17, 29)> 
<22, (23, 25, 14)> 
<22, (23, 14, 15)> 
<22, (23, 17, 29)>

For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<23, (22, 17, 29)> 
<23, (22, 25, 1)> 
<23, (22, 1, 27)> 
<23, (22, 17, 29)>

For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<24, (12, 7, 4)>

For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<25, (23, 12, 16)>

For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<26, (19, 14, 11)>

For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<27, (23, 29, 3)> 
<27, (23, 29, 17)> 
<27, (23, 3, 21)> 
<27, (23, 3, 29)>

For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<29, (27, 21, 17)> 
<29, (27, 21, 3)> 
<29, (27, 5, 20)> 
<29, (27, 5, 21)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [33].
