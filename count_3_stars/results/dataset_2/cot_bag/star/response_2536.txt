Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 15) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 20) (0, 24) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (26, 13) (26, 7) (27, 23) (27, 7) (27, 16) (7, 18) (7, 26) (7, 27) (25, 15) (25, 9) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 25) (9, 29) (29, 9) (29, 6) (8, 11) (8, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 29) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 27) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 0) (24, 28) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 22) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 23) (21, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures involving the following nodes:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star <0, (3, 20, 24)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star <2, (1, 20, 23)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star <6, (17, 18, 29)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star <7, (18, 26, 27)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star <9, (3, 15, 25)>
- Node 10 forms 2 3-stars <10, (2, 16, 22)> and <10, (12, 16, 22)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star <11, (4, 13, 22)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star <14, (5, 17, 21)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star <15, (9, 17, 20)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star <16, (10, 17, 27)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star <17, (14, 15, 16)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star <18, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star <19, (16, 23, 28)>
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star <20, (0, 15, 2)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star <22, (11, 13, 10)>
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star <23, (2, 19, 27)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star <24, (0, 28, 2)>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star <26, (7, 13, 18)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star <27, (16, 7, 23)>
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star <29, (6, 9, 18)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [19].
