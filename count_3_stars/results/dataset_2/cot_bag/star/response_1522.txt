Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 5) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 12) (15, 0) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 3) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 3) (13, 14) (13, 12) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes will have the potential to be the centers of 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 17), (1, 19), (1, 9). => 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2, 17), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 11), (2, 0). => 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 7), (3, 12), (3, 0). => 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 8), (4, 11). => 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 10), (5, 19), (5, 2). => 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 18). => 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 14), (8, 4), (8, 9), (8, 11). => 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 18), (9, 12). => 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 2), (11, 6). => 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (12, 9), (12, 2), (12, 16), (12, 13), (12, 3). => 10 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 17), (14, 8), (14, 18), (14, 13). => 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 2). => 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (18, 14), (18, 7), (18, 9). => 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (19, 1), (19, 5), (19, 6). => 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of these calculations: 
\[ 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 42 \]

Therefore, there are 42 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this number in brackets, we get: [42]

Here are the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, (17, 19, 9)>, <2, (17, 5, 12)>, <3, (7, 12, 0)>, <4, (8, 11, 4)>, <5, (10, 19, 2)>, <7, (3, 10, 18)>, <8, (14, 4, 9)>, <9, (8, 1, 18)>, <11, (4, 8, 6)>, <12, (9, 2, 16)>, <14, (17, 8, 13)>, <17, (14, 1, 2)>, <18, (14, 7, 9)>, <19, (1, 5, 6)>
