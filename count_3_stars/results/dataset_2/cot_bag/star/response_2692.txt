Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are the following nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: has neighbors {9, 7, 13, 10}
- Node 1: has neighbors {6, 11, 2}
- Node 2: has neighbors {6, 5, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 3: has neighbors {4, 8, 14}
- Node 4: has neighbors {7, 8, 12, 11, 3}
- Node 5: has neighbors {6, 13, 2}
- Node 6: has neighbors {9, 5, 1, 14, 2}
- Node 7: has neighbors {4, 12, 0, 13}
- Node 8: has neighbors {9, 4, 3}
- Node 9: has neighbors {6, 8, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: has neighbors {12, 0, 2, 14}
- Node 11: has neighbors {4, 1, 14}
- Node 12: has neighbors {9, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 13: has neighbors {9, 7, 5, 0}
- Node 14: has neighbors {6, 10, 11, 3, 2}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 65\)

So, there are 65 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us: [65]

We can now list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 7, 13)>
<0, (9, 7, 10)>
<0, (9, 13, 10)>
<0, (7, 13, 10)>
<1, (6, 11, 2)>
<2, (6, 5, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<4, (7, 11, 14)>
<4, (8, 3, 14)>
<4, (12, 7, 10)>
<6, (9, 5, 14)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<9, (6, 13, 12)>
<9, (8, 13, 12)>
<10, (12, 0, 14)>
<11, (4, 1, 14)>
<12, (9, 4, 7)>
<13, (9, 7, 5)>
<13, (7, 5, 0)>
<14, (2, 11, 3)>
