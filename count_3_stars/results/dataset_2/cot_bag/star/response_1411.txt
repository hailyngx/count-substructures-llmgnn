Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 18) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 17) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 37 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].
