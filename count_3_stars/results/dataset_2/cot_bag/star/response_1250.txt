Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 14) (18, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 21) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 27) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 19) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 9) (21, 22) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (28, 10) (1, 26) (1, 9) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 6) (7, 25) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 17) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 3) (14, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 0) (11, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 19) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 14) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (9, 27) (9, 1) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 8, 13, 20, and 26. 

For node 8: 
- It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- The 3-stars are: <8, (13, 3, 23)>, <8, (13, 4, 23)>, <8, (13, 3, 4)>, <8, (23, 4, 3)>

For node 13: 
- It forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- The 3-star is: <13, (8, 3, 27)>

For node 20: 
- It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- The 3-stars are: <20, (22, 15, 19)>, <20, (22, 10, 19)>, <20, (15, 24, 19)>, <20, (15, 10, 19)>

For node 26: 
- It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
- The 3-stars are: <26, (21, 14, 6)>, <26, (21, 5, 6)>, <26, (21, 1, 6)>, <26, (21, 5, 14)>, <26, (21, 1, 14)>, <26, (21, 1, 5)>, 
<26, (1, 5, 6)>, <26, (1, 14, 6)>, <26, (5, 14, 6)>, <26, (5, 14, 1)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
