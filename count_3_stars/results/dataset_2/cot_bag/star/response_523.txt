Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 20) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 0) (17, 11) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 26) (27, 6) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 12) (22, 9) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 29) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 11) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 1) (6, 27) (6, 20) (23, 10) (23, 26) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 1) (21, 27) (21, 18) (29, 12) (29, 18) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 6) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 26, and 27.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <3, (15, 18, 20)> <3, (15, 16, 20)> <3, (15, 16, 18)> <3, (18, 16, 20)>

2. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <4, (2, 13, 19)>

3. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <7, (1, 16, 25)> <7, (1, 16, 5)> <7, (1, 16, 7)> <7, (16, 25, 5)>

4. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <8, (5, 10, 11)>

5. Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

6. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <10, (15, 8, 23)>

7. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <12, (22, 27, 29)>

8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <14, (2, 5, 27)> <14, (2, 5, 25)> <14, (2, 5, 14)> <14, (5, 25, 27)>

9. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <15, (3, 16, 20)>

10. Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <16, (0, 1, 3)> <16, (0, 1, 7)> <16, (0, 3, 7)> <16, (0, 7, 25)> <16, (1, 3, 7)>
   <16, (1, 3, 15)> <16, (1, 7, 25)> <16, (3, 7, 15)> <16, (7, 15, 25)> <16, (0, 3, 15)>

11. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <18, (21, 26, 27)> <18, (21, 26, 29)> <18, (21, 26, 18)> <18, (21, 27, 29)>

12. Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <20, (3, 13, 6)>

13. Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

14. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <25, (0, 14, 27)> <25, (0, 14, 2)> <25, (0, 14, 5)> <25, (0, 14, 25)>

15. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <26, (11, 18, 27)> <26, (11, 18, 29)> <26, (11, 18, 21)> <26, (11, 18, 26)>

16. Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <27, (6, 14, 20)> <27, (6, 14, 25)> <27, (6, 14, 2)> <27, (6, 20, 25)> <27, (14, 20, 25)>
   <27, (14, 20, 2)> <27, (14, 25, 2)> <27, (20, 25, 2)> <27, (14, 20, 6)> <27, (14, 25, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [42] \]
