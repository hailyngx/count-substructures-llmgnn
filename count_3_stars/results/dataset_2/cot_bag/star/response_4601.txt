Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (18, 17) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 2) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Calculating for each applicable node:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 14, and 17 each contribute \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) 3-stars
- Nodes 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 19 each contribute \( 1 \times 9 = 9 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 28 + 9 = 37 \) 3-stars, so the final answer is [37].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 7, 14>
<0, 4, 3, 1>
<0, 7, 5, 14>
<0, 7, 10, 1>
<1, 10, 13, 5>
<2, 8, 12, 6>
<2, 9, 19, 5>
<3, 4, 0, 1>
<4, 0, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 12, 8>
<5, 13, 6, 10>
<7, 0, 4, 3>
<8, 2, 9, 19>
<9, 2, 8, 12>
<10, 1, 7, 0>
<11, 1, 10, 13>
<12, 6, 5, 13>
<14, 7, 0, 4>
<15, 1, 10, 13>
<17, 18, 17, 0>
