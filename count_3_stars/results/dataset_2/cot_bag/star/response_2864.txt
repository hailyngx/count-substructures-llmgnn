Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 13) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 14, 3
- Node 1: 8, 7, 13, 11
- Node 2: 5, 9, 13
- Node 3: 0, 7, 10, 13
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 8, 6, 2, 10, 7
- Node 6: 8, 5, 7, 10, 11
- Node 7: 5, 6, 3, 10, 13, 1
- Node 8: 4, 9, 5, 6, 1
- Node 9: 8, 14, 2, 12
- Node 10: 5, 6, 12, 3, 7
- Node 11: 6, 12, 1, 13
- Node 12: 14, 9, 10, 11
- Node 13: 2, 11, 3, 7, 1
- Node 14: 0, 9, 12

Since nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 have three or more neighbors, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

For node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 2, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.
For node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 5, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 6, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 7, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 8, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 10, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 11, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 12, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 13, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get:
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 91 \)

So, there are a total of 91 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [91].
