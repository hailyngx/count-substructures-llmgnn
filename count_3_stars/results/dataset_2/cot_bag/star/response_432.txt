Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (0, 14, 8)>
- <4, (7, 5, 11)>
- <4, (8, 7, 3)>
- <7, (10, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 11, 6)>
- <10, (6, 1, 13)>
- <11, (5, 10, 9)>
- <13, (1, 9, 3)>
- <14, (4, 8, 2)>
