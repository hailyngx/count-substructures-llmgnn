This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 13) (5, 6) (5, 24) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (10, 1) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 28) (11, 9) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 24) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 27) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 7) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 16) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 19) (3, 0) (3, 4) (16, 24) (16, 20) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 13) (2, 26) (2, 7) (2, 23) (12, 21) (12, 8) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 22) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 4) (18, 0) (27, 8) (27, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed.

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (21, 14, 10).
2. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 5, 19).
3. Node 9 has 5 neighbors (6, 8, 0, 11, 13).
4. Node 21 has 4 neighbors (1, 12, 15, 29).
5. Node 22 has 5 neighbors (26, 24, 20, 29, 7).
6. Node 26 has 4 neighbors (22, 14, 2, 17).
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors (22, 25, 14, 2, 17).
8. Node 25 has 2 neighbors (7, 23).
9. Node 10 has 1 neighbor (1).
10. Node 15 has 3 neighbors (21, 23, 28).
11. Node 11 has 2 neighbors (9, 20).
12. Node 23 has 4 neighbors (25, 15, 2, 24).
13. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (9, 12, 27).
14. Node 14 has 3 neighbors (1, 26, 7).
15. Node 24 has 4 neighbors (5, 22, 23, 16).
16. Node 17 has 3 neighbors (26, 7, 27).
17. Node 0 has 5 neighbors (9, 3, 28, 18, 19).
18. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 4).
19. Node 16 has 2 neighbors (24, 20).
20. Node 28 has 3 neighbors (15, 0, 13).
21. Node 2 has 3 neighbors (26, 7, 23).
22. Node 12 has 2 neighbors (21, 8).
23. Node 20 has 3 neighbors (22, 11, 16).
24. Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 19, 13).
25. Node 13 has 3 neighbors (9, 28, 4).
26. Node 18 has 1 neighbor (0).
27. Node 27 has 2 neighbors (8, 17).

Counting the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 9 forms 9 3-stars.
4. Node 21 forms 4 3-stars.
5. Node 22 forms 10 3-stars.
6. Node 26 forms 4 3-stars.
7. Node 7 forms 10 3-stars.
8. Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 23 forms 4 3-stars.
10. Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
11. Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
12. Node 24 forms 4 3-stars.
13. Node 17 forms 3 3-stars.
14. Node 0 forms 10 3-stars.
15. Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
16. Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
17. Node 20 forms 3 3-stars.
18. Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
19. Node 13 forms 3 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 9 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
