Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 6) (18, 13) (28, 4) (28, 19) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 5) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 25) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (23, 11) (23, 0) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 25) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 10) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 25) (24, 16) (24, 29) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 2) (27, 19) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 19) (19, 28) (19, 27) (19, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 13) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 18, 4, 26, 1, 9, 22, 5, 2, 29, 0, 25, 10, 12, 14, 13, 19, 17, and 15. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 58 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (16, 18, 29)>, <16, (11, 24, 1)>, <18, (11, 4, 26)>, <4, (18, 13, 28)>, <26, (18, 14, 22)>, <1, (16, 7, 29)>, <9, (16, 8, 17)>, <22, (26, 17, 12)>, <5, (16, 8, 26)>, <2, (11, 7, 12)>, <0, (3, 23, 25)>, <25, (8, 14, 13)>, <10, (9, 5, 12)>, <12, (22, 2, 10)>, <14, (22, 25, 13)>, <13, (18, 25, 19)>, <19, (28, 27, 13)>, <17, (15, 22, 9)>, <15, (20, 6, 17)>
