Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 9, 10, and 14.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 11, 12, and 14.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 9, 12, and 13.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 10, and 13.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 9, and 13.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, and 12.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, and 14.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 10, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64

So, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 12, 14)>
<2, (3, 12, 13)>
<3, (0, 2, 14)>
<4, (6, 13, 5)>
<6, (7, 13, 9)>
<9, (11, 0, 2)>
<12, (1, 7, 8)>
<13, (2, 4, 6)>
<14, (0, 10, 3)>
