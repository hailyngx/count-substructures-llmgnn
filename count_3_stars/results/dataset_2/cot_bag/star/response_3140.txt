Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 16) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 14) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 2) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 16) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first calculate the degree of each node based on the provided edge information:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars around each such node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: C(5,3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 11: C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 27 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, 11, 12>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <2, 11, 16>
- <4, 15, 18>
- <0, 18, 19>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 4, 18>
- <6, 9, 17>
- <1, 8, 5>
- <10, 11, 7>
- <15, 19, 14>
- <2, 12, 18>
- <2, 13, 5>
- <2, 14, 16>
- <3, 5, 13>
- <9, 6, 17>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <3, 10, 11>
- <4, 15, 19>
- <6, 2, 11>
- <7, 10, 11>
- <2, 6, 14>
- <6, 17, 11>
- <4, 1, 18>
- <13, 2, 5>
- <16, 9, 17>
