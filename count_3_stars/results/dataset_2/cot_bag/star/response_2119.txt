Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes in this graph with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up:

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors (9, 13, 8). So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 2, there are 5 neighbors (3, 8, 6, 4, 14). So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 5, there are 5 neighbors (3, 13, 6, 4, 10). So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors (7, 2, 0, 5). So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 8, there are 6 neighbors (1, 13, 2, 9, 11, 7). So, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 9, there are 5 neighbors (1, 8, 7, 10, 12). So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 10, there are 6 neighbors (3, 5, 9, 12, 14, 4). So, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 75.

So, there are [75] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
