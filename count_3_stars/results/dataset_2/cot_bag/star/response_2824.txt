Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 16, 19)>, 
<2, (9, 16, 15)>, 
<4, (13, 18, 6)>,
<5, (1, 7, 17)>,
<8, (13, 12, 9)>,
<9, (15, 2, 8)>,
<13, (4, 10, 19)>,
<14, (18, 11, 17)>,
<15, (3, 2, 5)>,
<16, (0, 18, 2)>,
<17, (7, 5, 14)>,
<18, (4, 11, 16)>,
<19, (0, 13, 16)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [61], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 16, 19)>, <2, (9, 16, 15)>, <4, (13, 18, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 17)>, <8, (13, 12, 9)>, <9, (15, 2, 8)>, <13, (4, 10, 19)>, <14, (18, 11, 17)>, <15, (3, 2, 5)>, <16, (0, 18, 2)>, <17, (7, 5, 14)>, <18, (4, 11, 16)>, <19, (0, 13, 16)>.
