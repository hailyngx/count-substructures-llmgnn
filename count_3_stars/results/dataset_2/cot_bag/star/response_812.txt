Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 7, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 0, 10, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 11, 0, 3, 7, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 12, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 11, 13, 5, 14, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 11, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 14, 5, and 5.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 8, 14, and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 8, and 2.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 10, and 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 10, and 7.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4, 9, 11, and 13 have 5 neighbors each, contributing a total of \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 1, 10, 12, and 14 have 4 neighbors each, but that's not enough to form 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 35 + 35 + 40] = [120] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 13)>
- <3, (5, 7, 13)>
- <3, (5, 7, 7)>
- <5, (7, 9, 11)>
- <5, (7, 9, 11)>
- <5, (7, 11, 13)>
- <5, (7, 11, 13)>
- <5, (7, 5, 13)>
- <5, (7, 5, 13)>
- <7, (5, 11, 13)>
- <7, (5, 11, 13)>
