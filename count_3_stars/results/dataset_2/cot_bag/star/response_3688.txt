Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: 17, 4, 9      
2: 0, 10      
3: 0, 9, 8      
4: 1, 19, 11, 9      
5: 13, 12, 17      
6: 18      
7: 13, 18      
8: 3, 15, 12      
9: 1, 3, 19, 10, 4      
10: 0, 2, 9      
11: 17, 18, 14, 12, 4      
12: 8, 5, 11, 14      
13: 5, 15, 7      
14: 11, 12      
15: 8, 13, 17      
16: 17      
17: 1, 5, 16, 15, 11      
18: 11, 6, 7      
19: 4, 9      

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 3-stars in the graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, 17, 4>
<3, 0, 9>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 11, 19>
<9, 3, 1>
<9, 11, 19>
<9, 10, 4>
<9, 11, 4>
<11, 12, 17>
<11, 17, 18>
<11, 12, 14>
<11, 12, 4>
<17, 15, 11>
<17, 5, 11>
<17, 16, 15>
<17, 15, 13>
<12, 8, 11>
<12, 5, 11>
<12, 14, 11>
<15, 8, 13>
<18, 11, 17>
<18, 7, 13>
<18, 11, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
