Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) 

Response:
This graph has a 3-star centered at node 0 with leaves (1, 4, 6). 
There is another 3-star centered at node 6 with leaves (3, 5, 13).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
