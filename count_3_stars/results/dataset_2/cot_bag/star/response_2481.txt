Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (27, 5) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 6) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 3) (14, 25) (14, 24) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 15) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 18) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 15) (9, 20) (9, 21) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 18) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 12) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 21) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 23) (16, 27) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 26) (15, 17) (24, 5) (24, 14) (24, 16) (21, 4) (21, 9) (21, 22) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 21) (29, 13) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 11) (18, 3) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 29) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 10) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 3 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 2 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 25: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 48

So, there are 48 3-stars in total. Now, let's list them:
<1, (10, 1, 12)>
<2, (2, 6, 17)>
<3, (10, 3, 11)>
<5, (5, 6, 24)>
<6, (4, 6, 20)>
<8, (5, 8, 16)>
<10, (10, 1, 3)>
<11, (3, 11, 18)>
<16, (27, 16, 24)>
<17, (7, 17, 16)>
<19, (19, 12, 29)>
<20, (6, 20, 25)>
<21, (4, 21, 22)>
<22, (19, 22, 21)>
<23, (7, 23, 10)>
<25, (14, 25, 24)>
<28, (6, 11, 28)>
<29, (13, 29, 19)>
