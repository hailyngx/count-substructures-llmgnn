Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we find that there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 44 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

All unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
