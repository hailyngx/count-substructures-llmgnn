Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 78 \)

Thus, there are a total of 78 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 14, 12)>, <0, (5, 9, 6)>, <0, (7, 4, 1)>, <0, (14, 4, 10)>, <2, (11, 12, 14)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (7, 4, 1)>, <2, (8, 13, 6)>, <2, (12, 14, 4)>, <3, (10, 13, 1)>, <3, (0, 7, 11)>, <3, (14, 4, 10)>, <4, (7, 10, 3)>, <4, (1, 9, 13)>, <4, (14, 0, 3)>, <7, (0, 5, 14)>, <7, (2, 11, 12)>, <7, (4, 1, 10)>, <7, (10, 3, 13)>, <7, (11, 12, 2)>, <10, (13, 3, 0)>, <10, (4, 1, 9)>, <10, (14, 0, 3)>, <13, (9, 1, 4)>, <13, (6, 5, 9)>, <13, (10, 3, 0)>, <13, (8, 2, 9)>, <13, (1, 9, 4)>, <14, (0, 3, 10)>, <14, (2, 11, 12)>, <14, (4, 1, 10)>, <14, (12, 2, 11)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [78].
