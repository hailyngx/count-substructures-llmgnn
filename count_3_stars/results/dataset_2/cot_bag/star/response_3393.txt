Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 4) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 9) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 13) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 13, 18
Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 10, 17
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 3: 1, 8, 11
Node 4: 9, 12, 14, 19
Node 5: 2, 11
Node 6: 2, 11
Node 7: 1, 17
Node 8: 3, 16, 18
Node 9: 4, 10, 16, 19
Node 10: 1, 9, 11, 19
Node 11: 3, 5, 6, 10
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 0, 16, 17
Node 14: 4, 18
Node 15: 17, 19
Node 16: 8, 9, 13
Node 17: 1, 7, 13, 15
Node 18: 0, 8, 14
Node 19: 4, 9, 10, 15

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 10, 17)>
<1, (3, 10, 11)>
<1, (7, 10, 17)>
<1, (17, 15, 19)>
<1, (17, 13, 16)>
<3, (1, 8, 16)>
<4, (9, 10, 19)>
<9, (4, 10, 19)>
<10, (1, 3, 11)>
<11, (5, 6, 10)>
<17, (7, 13, 15)>
<17, (13, 16, 15)>
<17, (15, 19, 1)>
<17, (15, 19, 7)>
<17, (19, 1, 17)>
<17, (19, 7, 1)>
