Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 7) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 5) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 19) (21, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (25, 29) (25, 15) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 25) (29, 5) (29, 3) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 14) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (23, 26) (23, 13) (8, 11) (19, 18) (19, 21) (10, 21) (10, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 2) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 17) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 13) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 26) (12, 20) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 2) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 22, 27, 21, 26, 4, 16, 14, 5, 1, 17, 24, 15, 29, and 6.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
3. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3}= 4 \)
12. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars: \(10 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 43\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<22, (5, 29, 16)>
<27, (4, 24, 0)>
<21, (1, 26, 10)>
<26, (7, 14, 21)>
<4, (24, 22, 16)>
<16, (4, 2, 20)>
<14, (26, 6, 22)>
<5, (29, 22, 1)>
<1, (5, 10, 17)>
<17, (1, 26, 15)>
<24, (13, 6, 4)>
<15, (25, 17, 13)>
<29, (3, 5, 25)>
<6, (24, 14, 21)>
