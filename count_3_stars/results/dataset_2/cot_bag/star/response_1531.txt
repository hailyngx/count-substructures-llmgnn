Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up:

1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Thus, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (9, 7, 1)>
2. <1, (5, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (5, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (5, 7, 1)>
5. <6, (9, 4, 2)>
6. <7, (4, 9, 0)>
7. <9, (6, 4, 8)>
8. <9, (6, 4, 1)>
