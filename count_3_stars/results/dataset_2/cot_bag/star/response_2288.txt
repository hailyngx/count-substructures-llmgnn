Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges: 
(11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) 
(16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) 
(5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) 
(9, 13) 
(6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) 
(19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) 
(1, 15) (1, 14) 
(15, 7) (15, 0) 
(13, 17) (13, 3) 
(17, 0) 
(18, 0) 
(7, 15) 
(14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) 
(0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) 
(3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) 
(10, 19) (10, 3) 
(4, 16) 
(12, 3)
```

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (13 nodes total)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum_{i=1}^{13} \binom{deg(i)}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 43 \]

So, there are a total of 43 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [43]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 15, 18>, <0, 17, 18>, <0, 17, 15>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 10, 12>, <4, 12, 14>, <5, 6, 19>, <5, 17, 3>, <6, 10, 19>, <13, 17, 3>, <14, 4, 11>, <14, 4, 12>, <15, 0, 17>, <16, 4, 11>, <16, 4, 14>, <17, 0, 15>, <18, 0, 15>, <19, 6, 10>, <19, 6, 14>
