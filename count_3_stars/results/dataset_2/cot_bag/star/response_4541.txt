Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14.

For the central node 4, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For the central node 7, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For the central node 10, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For the central node 11, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For the central node 12, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For the central node 14, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 10, 12)>
<7, (4, 10, 12)>
<10, (4, 5, 14)>
<11, (3, 6, 2)>
<12, (4, 7, 14)>
<14, (4, 10, 6)>
