Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9)
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (2, 7, 8, 9)
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5)
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5)
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
For nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 36 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
