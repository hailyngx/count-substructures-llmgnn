Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 10, 9, 6
- Node 1: 12, 11, 14
- Node 2: 13, 10, 17, 14
- Node 3: 15, 13
- Node 4: 12
- Node 5: 8, 11
- Node 6: 15, 12, 0
- Node 7: 17, 16, 14
- Node 8: 13, 5, 16, 11
- Node 9: 19, 0, 16, 11
- Node 10: 15, 0, 18, 2
- Node 11: 8, 5, 1, 9
- Node 12: 19, 4, 6, 1
- Node 13: 3, 8, 17, 2
- Node 14: 7, 1, 2
- Node 15: 3, 10, 6
- Node 16: 8, 7, 9
- Node 17: 13, 2, 7
- Node 18: 10
- Node 19: 12, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <2, (13, 10, 17)>, <2, (13, 10, 14)>, <2, (13, 17, 14)>, <2, (10, 17, 14)>
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <8, (13, 5, 16)>, <8, (13, 5, 11)>, <8, (13, 16, 11)>, <8, (5, 16, 11)>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <9, (19, 0, 16)>, <9, (19, 0, 11)>, <9, (19, 16, 11)>, <9, (0, 16, 11)>
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <10, (15, 0, 18)>, <10, (15, 0, 2)>, <10, (15, 18, 2)>, <10, (0, 18, 2)>
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <12, (19, 6, 1)>, <12, (19, 6, 4)>, <12, (19, 1, 4)>, <12, (6, 1, 4)>
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <13, (3, 8, 17)>, <13, (3, 8, 2)>, <13, (3, 17, 2)>, <13, (8, 17, 2)>
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <16, (8, 7, 9)>, <16, (8, 7, 11)>, <16, (8, 9, 11)>, <16, (7, 9, 11)>
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <19, (12, 9, 16)>, <19, (12, 9, 11)>, <19, (12, 16, 11)>, <19, (9, 16, 11)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives a final count of [28].
