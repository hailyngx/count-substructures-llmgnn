Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (1, 11) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 4) (18, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 5, 9, 10, 17, 8, 1, 6, 2, 12, 19, 7, 4, and 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars and list them:
- For node 11, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <11, (16, 10, 1)>, <11, (16, 10, 5)>, <11, (10, 1, 5)>, <11, (1, 5, 16)>
- For node 5, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 11)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- For node 9, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars: <9, (17, 4, 19)>, <9, (17, 4, 6)>, <9, (17, 4, 8)>, <9, (17, 4, 9)>, <9, (17, 6, 8)>, <9, (17, 6, 19)>, <9, (17, 8, 19)>, <9, (4, 6, 19)>, <9, (4, 8, 19)>, <9, (6, 8, 19)>
- For node 10, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars: <10, (17, 15, 19)>, <10, (17, 6, 19)>, <10, (17, 15, 6)>, <10, (17, 15, 10)>, <10, (17, 6, 15)>, <10, (15, 19, 6)>, <10, (15, 6, 19)>, <10, (15, 6, 10)>, <10, (15, 19, 17)>, <10, (6, 19, 17)>
- For node 17, there are $\binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars
- For node 8, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <8, (6, 12, 0)>, <8, (12, 0, 13)>, <8, (12, 2, 0)>, <8, (0, 13, 12)>
- For node 1, there is only 1 3-star: <1, (7, 11, 5)>
- For node 6, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <6, (4, 10, 8)>, <6, (4, 2, 10)>, <6, (4, 12, 10)>, <6, (2, 8, 12)>
- For node 2, there are $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star: <2, (12, 4, 5)>
- For node 12, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <12, (0, 3, 8)>, <12, (0, 13, 2)>, <12, (2, 4, 3)>, <12, (0, 13, 4)>
- For node 19, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <19, (7, 15, 10)>, <19, (7, 15, 9)>, <19, (7, 3, 15)>, <19, (7, 3, 19)>
- For node 7, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <7, (19, 3, 1)>, <7, (19, 3, 15)>, <7, (19, 3, 7)>, <7, (19, 3, 12)>
- For node 4, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <4, (13, 2, 9)>, <4, (13, 0, 6)>, <4, (13, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>
- For node 13, there is only 1 3-star: <13, (0, 4, 12)>

Summarizing the total number of 3-stars calculated: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
