Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 9) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 4) (27, 11) (27, 25) (27, 19) (9, 16) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 7) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 0) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 21) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 21) (2, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 14) (20, 11) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 25) (5, 3) (5, 29) (25, 27) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 28) (0, 23) (0, 29) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 18) (14, 24) (14, 18) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 7) (7, 26) (7, 18) (7, 13) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 29) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 15, 3, and 28.
- Node 2 has neighbors 8, 19, and 4.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 10, and 13.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 28, and 29.
- Node 6 has neighbors 17, 25, and 29.
- Node 7 has neighbors 26, 18, and 13.
- Node 8 has neighbors 23, 2, and 28.
- Node 9 has neighbors 16, 26, and 24.
- Node 11 has neighbors 10, 27, and 20.
- Node 12 has neighbors 21, 25, and 18.
- Node 15 has neighbors 1, 23, and 4.
- Node 16 has neighbors 22, 9, and 24.
- Node 17 has neighbors 6, 19, and 21.
- Node 18 has neighbors 6, 14, and 12.
- Node 21 has neighbors 17, 2, and 25.
- Node 22 has neighbors 16, 24, and 14.
- Node 24 has neighbors 26, 22, and 14.
- Node 25 has neighbors 27, 21, and 6.
- Node 26 has neighbors 9, 24, and 7.
- Node 28 has neighbors 1, 8, and 4.
- Node 29 has neighbors 5, 0, and 6.

Based on the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each and then sum them up:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 21 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 24 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 25 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 26 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <7, (26, 18, 13)>
- <7, (26, 18, 14)>
- <18, (6, 12, 14)>
- <18, (6, 12, 25)>
- <22, (16, 14, 24)>
- <22, (16, 24, 26)>
- <22, (24, 16, 26)>
- <24, (14, 16, 22)>
- <24, (14, 18, 26)>
- <24, (14, 22, 26)>
- <25, (6, 12, 18)>
- <25, (6, 12, 21)>
- <25, (12, 6, 18)>
- <26, (7, 9, 24)>
- <28, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 21, 25)>
- <29, (0, 5, 6)>
