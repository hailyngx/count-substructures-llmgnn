Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 5) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 82

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 14)>, <0, (1, 7, 12)>, <0, (1, 7, 14)>, <0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 7, 11)>, <0, (1, 11, 13)>, <0, (1, 7, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 13)>, <0, (3, 7, 11)>, <0, (3, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 12)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 8, 12)>, <8, (9, 11, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].
