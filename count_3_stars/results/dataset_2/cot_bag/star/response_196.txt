Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, and 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 6, and 10: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 7, and 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 8, and 12: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 8, and 11: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, and 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 7, 10, and 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 9, and 11: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 8, and 14: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes 8, 11, and 14: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 11, and 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we have a total of 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 4>,
<1, 3, 6>,
<3, 1, 7>,
<4, 0, 8>,
<6, 1, 8>,
<8, 4, 13>,
<9, 7, 10>,
<10, 1, 11>,
<11, 6, 14>,
<13, 8, 14>,
<14, 5, 11>.
