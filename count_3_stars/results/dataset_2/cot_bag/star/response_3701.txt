Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 3>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 0, 5>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 8, 1>, <6, 1, 3>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 7>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 2, 0>, <6, 3, 1>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 9, 5>, <7, 3, 6>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 3, 1>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 3>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 5, 0>, <9, 6, 7>, <9, 6, 2>, <9, 6, 5>.
