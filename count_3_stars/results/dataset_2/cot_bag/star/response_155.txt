Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges as described. 

Let's first identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 13, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 9, 6, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 12, 5, 10, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 12, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 9, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 2, 11, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 1, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 10, 5, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 9, 0, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 13, 4, 3, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 6, 2, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 6, 14, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 13, 2, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 9, 3, 12, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbor {11}

Next, we determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 8, 13, and 2. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 6. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 12, and 5. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 12, and 9. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 11. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, and 11. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 10. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 5. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 9, and 0. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, and 4. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 2. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 14. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, and 2. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 3. => [(3 choose 3) = 1 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 13, 2>, <1, 7, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 12, 5>, <3, 13, 12, 9>, <4, 2, 9, 11>, <5, 7, 2, 11>, <6, 7, 1, 10>, <7, 6, 10, 5>, <8, 13, 9, 0>, <9, 8, 13, 4>, <10, 7, 6, 2>, <11, 4, 6, 14>, <12, 8, 13, 2>, <13, 8, 9, 3>
