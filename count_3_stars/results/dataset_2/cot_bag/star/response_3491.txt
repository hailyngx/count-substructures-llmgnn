This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 28) (29, 5) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 6) (0, 25) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 23) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 12) (26, 19) (22, 20) (22, 19) (22, 4) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 14) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 27) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 12) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 15) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 27) (1, 25) (1, 7) (1, 24) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 24) (10, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 11) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 15) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Node 4: Neighbors - 13, 22, 27
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = 1

Node 5: Neighbors - 12, 23, 27, 29
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 7: Neighbors - 1, 3, 18, 28
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 8: Neighbors - 9, 11, 13, 16
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 13: Neighbors - 4, 6, 8, 17
Number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 15: Neighbors - 11, 12, 23, 24
Number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 16: Neighbors - 8, 9, 18
Number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center = 1

Node 17: Neighbors - 3, 13, 27
Number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center = 1

Node 18: Neighbors - 7, 16, 25
Number of 3-stars with node 18 as the center = 1

Node 19: Neighbors - 12, 22, 26
Number of 3-stars with node 19 as the center = 1

Node 20: Neighbors - 22, 23, 28
Number of 3-stars with node 20 as the center = 1

Node 21: Neighbors - 6, 14, 24
Number of 3-stars with node 21 as the center = 1

Node 22: Neighbors - 19, 20, 4
Number of 3-stars with node 22 as the center = 1

Node 23: Neighbors - 12, 15, 20, 5
Number of 3-stars with node 23 as the center = 4

Node 24: Neighbors - 1, 15, 21, 2
Number of 3-stars with node 24 as the center = 1

Node 25: Neighbors - 0, 18, 1
Number of 3-stars with node 25 as the center = 1

Node 27: Neighbors - 4, 5, 14, 17
Number of 3-stars with node 27 as the center = 1

Node 28: Neighbors - 2, 7, 0, 20
Number of 3-stars with node 28 as the center = 1

Node 29: Neighbors - 5
Number of 3-stars with node 29 as the center = 0

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated from each node, we get a total of 30 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (13, 22, 27)>
<5, (12, 23, 27)>
<7, (1, 3, 18)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<13, (4, 6, 17)>
<15, (11, 12, 23)>
<16, (8, 9, 18)>
<17, (3, 13, 27)>
<18, (7, 16, 25)>
<19, (12, 22, 26)>
<20, (22, 23, 28)>
<21, (6, 14, 24)>
<22, (4, 19, 20)>
<23, (5, 12, 15)>
<24, (1, 15, 21)>
<25, (0, 18, 25)>
<27, (4, 5, 14)>
<28, (0, 20, 2)>
