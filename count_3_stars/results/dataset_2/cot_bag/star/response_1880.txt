Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 8) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 4) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 13) (1, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 29) (17, 28) (3, 11) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (12, 29) (12, 18) (23, 16) (23, 26) (23, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 13) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 12) (10, 13) (5, 21) (5, 4) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 22) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 0: 3-stars = 1
2. Node 2: 3-stars = 1
3. Node 4: 3-stars = 1
4. Node 8: 3-stars = 1
5. Node 11: 3-stars = 1
6. Node 14: 3-stars = 1
7. Node 16: 3-stars = 1
8. Node 18: 3-stars = 1
9. Node 19: 3-stars = 1
10. Node 20: 3-stars = 1
11. Node 21: 3-stars = 1
12. Node 22: 3-stars = 1
13. Node 23: 3-stars = 1
14. Node 24: 3-stars = 1
15. Node 25: 3-stars = 1
16. Node 26: 3-stars = 1
17. Node 27: 3-stars = 1
18. Node 28: 3-stars = 1
19. Node 29: 3-stars = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 19 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ [19] \]

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 21, 20)>
<2, (0, 29, 24)>
<4, (27, 19, 5)>
<8, (16, 25, 19)>
<11, (16, 14, 3)>
<14, (22, 15, 11)>
<16, (11, 8, 23)>
<18, (15, 27, 12)>
<19, (23, 8, 4)>
<20, (9, 0, 13)>
<21, (0, 4, 5)>
<22, (7, 14, 24)>
<23, (26, 19, 16)>
<24, (2, 29, 1)>
<25, (8, 26, 6)>
<26, (29, 25, 23)>
<27, (15, 18, 4)>
<28, (17, 13, 2)>
<29, (26, 12, 2)>
