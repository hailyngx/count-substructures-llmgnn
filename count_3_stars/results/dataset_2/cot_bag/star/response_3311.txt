Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 17) (19, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 17) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Add all these up: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 55 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 13, 14>
<3, 6, 12>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 0, 17>
<6, 3, 14>
<7, 6, 11>
<9, 14, 19>
<12, 10, 16>
<15, 2, 18>
<17, 9, 19>
