Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 20) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 22) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 7) (4, 21) (27, 28) (27, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (25, 15) (25, 18) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 21) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 6) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 5) (24, 1) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 20) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 13) (29, 7) (29, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 18) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 22) (6, 7) (21, 4) (21, 19) (18, 25) (18, 5) (18, 12) (20, 11) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 29) (12, 18) (28, 27) (28, 15) (23, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 45 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
These 3-stars can be represented as: 
<0, 14, 12>, <1, 3, 10>, <2, 17, 19>, <2, 17, 1>, <2, 19, 14>, <2, 19, 22>, <3, 10, 17>, <6, 11, 20>, 
<7, 13, 29>, <7, 13, 6>, <8, 2, 19>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 6>, <10, 3, 9>, <12, 14, 17>, 
<12, 14, 0>, <12, 14, 18>, <12, 17, 2>, <12, 17, 0>, <12, 17, 29>, <12, 18, 5>, <14, 0, 15>, <14, 0, 19>, 
<14, 0, 16>, <14, 16, 26>, <15, 26, 13>, <15, 26, 16>, <15, 26, 0>, <15, 26, 28>, <16, 24, 1>, <16, 24, 20>, 
<16, 24, 23>, <19, 2, 1>, <19, 2, 22>, <19, 2, 21>, <19, 21, 4>, <19, 21, 14>, <19, 22, 8>, <19, 22, 6>, 
<22, 6, 11>, <22, 6, 27>, <24, 1, 3>, <24, 1, 16>, <24, 1, 20>, <24, 20, 11>, <24, 23, 24>, <26, 13, 29>, 
<26, 13, 7>, <26, 16, 14>, <26, 16, 24>, <28, 27, 6>.
