Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 
\( 4 + 35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 96 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [96]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 14)>, <1, (2, 7, 14)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (9, 10, 13)>, <4, (2, 9, 12)>, <5, (1, 7, 13)>, <6, (2, 7, 11)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 12)>, <11, (6, 10, 12)>, <12, (4, 8, 11)>, <13, (1, 3, 5)>, <14, (0, 6, 8)>.
