Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are two nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors: node 4 and node 7. 

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms the following 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)> (3-stars formed: 3)

For node 7:
- Node 7 forms the following 3-stars: <7, (4, 9, 11)> (1 3-star formed)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <4, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <7, (4, 9, 11)>.
