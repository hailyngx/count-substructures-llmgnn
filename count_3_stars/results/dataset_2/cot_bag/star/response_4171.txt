Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 21) (15, 3) (15, 18) (27, 29) (27, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 8) (1, 3) (1, 28) (1, 7) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 0) (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 7) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 6) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 25) (6, 22) (6, 10) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 28) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 19) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 7) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 24) (14, 20) (18, 15) (18, 0) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 16) (20, 27) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 14) (21, 26) (21, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
