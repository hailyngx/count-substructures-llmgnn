Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up gives a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
