Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 20) (23, 10) (23, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) (8, 28) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 27) (26, 4) (26, 1) (26, 11) (21, 19) (28, 8) (28, 12) (28, 18) (28, 5) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (9, 19) (10, 23) (10, 3) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 20) (6, 0) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 16) (11, 26) (11, 29) (25, 13) (25, 18) (0, 6) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 6) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 29) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 18) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 21) (19, 9) (19, 20) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 19) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [55] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 55.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 20, 22)>
<2, (1, 22, 27)>
<5, (13, 16, 18)>
<6, (1, 20, 29)>
<12, (3, 24, 28)>
<13, (5, 17, 25)>
<16, (2, 5, 18)>
<18, (5, 16, 25)>
<19, (9, 20, 21)>
<20, (4, 6, 19)>
<22, (14, 17, 27)>
<24, (7, 12, 29)>
<26, (1, 11, 29)>
<27, (1, 9, 22)>
<28, (7, 18, 24)>
<29, (6, 15, 20)>
