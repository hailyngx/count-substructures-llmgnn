Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 6, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For node 0 and node 3, they both have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
