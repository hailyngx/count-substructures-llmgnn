Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 21) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 17) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 26) (28, 9) (29, 11) (29, 20) (29, 14) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 13) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 23) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 14) (12, 17) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 23) (22, 4) (22, 5) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 13) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (9, 17) (17, 21) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 9) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 23) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will identify the central nodes and count the number of 3-stars formed with each central node.

Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 1: 6, 18  
Node 2: 15, 18, 19  
Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 25, 26  
Node 4: 14, 22, 23  
Node 5: 3, 16, 22  
Node 6: 1, 3, 23, 25  
Node 7: 21, 24  
Node 8: 3, 14  
Node 9: 10, 17, 27, 28  
Node 10: 9, 11, 18  
Node 11: 10, 20, 25, 29  
Node 12: 17  
Node 13: 19, 24, 26, 27  
Node 14: 4, 8, 29  
Node 15: 2, 23, 27  
Node 16: 5, 19, 23, 27  
Node 17: 9, 12, 19, 21  
Node 18: 1, 2, 10, 26  
Node 19: 2, 13, 16, 17, 20  
Node 20: 11, 19, 23, 29  
Node 21: 7, 17  
Node 22: 4, 5  
Node 23: 4, 6, 15, 16, 20  
Node 24: 7, 13  
Node 25: 3, 6, 10, 11  
Node 26: 3, 13, 18  
Node 27: 9, 13, 15, 16  
Node 28: 9  
Node 29: 11, 14, 20  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 15: [1]  
Node 27: [1]  
Node 3: [1]  
Node 13: [1]  
Node 11: [1]  
Node 25: [1]  
Node 18: [1]  
Node 9: [1]  
Node 16: [1]  
Node 17: [1]  
Node 19: [3]  
Node 20: [1]  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<15, 2, 27>
<27, 9, 13>
<3, 5, 6>
<13, 19, 26>
<11, 10, 25>
<25, 3, 6>
<18, 1, 10>
<9, 17, 27>
<16, 19, 23>
<17, 12, 21>
<19, 16, 20>
<20, 11, 29>
<25, 6, 11>
<18, 2, 26>
