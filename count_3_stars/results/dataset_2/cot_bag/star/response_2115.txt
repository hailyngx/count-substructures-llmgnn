Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 9) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 11) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 5) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 19) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 10
- Node 2: has neighbors 0, 17, 19
- Node 3: has neighbors 5, 8, 12
- Node 4: has neighbors 0, 5, 17
- Node 5: has neighbors 3, 4, 14
- Node 6: has neighbors 12, 13, 19
- Node 7: has neighbors 10, 11, 13
- Node 9: has neighbors 8, 11, 15
- Node 10: has neighbors 0, 7, 13
- Node 11: has neighbors 7, 9, 14
- Node 12: has neighbors 1, 3, 6, 14
- Node 13: has neighbors 6, 7, 10, 19
- Node 14: has neighbors 1, 5, 11, 12, 18
- Node 18: has neighbors 14, 16, 19
- Node 19: has neighbors 2, 13, 18, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 17, 19)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<4, (0, 5, 17)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<6, (12, 13, 19)>
<7, (10, 11, 13)>
<9, (8, 11, 15)>
<10, (0, 7, 13)>
<11, (7, 9, 14)>
<12, (1, 3, 6), (1, 6, 12), (3, 6, 12), (14, 1, 12)>
<13, (6, 7, 10), (6, 10, 13), (7, 10, 13), (6, 13, 19)>
<14, (1, 5, 11), (1, 11, 14), (5, 11, 14), (1, 12, 14), (12, 11, 14)>
<18, (14, 16, 18), (14, 18, 19), (16, 18, 19)>
<19, (2, 13, 19), (2, 18, 19), (13, 6, 19), (6, 12, 19)>
