Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, and 15. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
10. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up gives a total of 24 3-stars. Putting this number inside brackets gives us [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (10, 15, 5)>, <1, (15, 5, 10)>, <1, (15, 12, 3)>, <1, (15, 14, 7)>, <2, (8, 13, 17)>, <3, (17, 2, 7)>, <3, (17, 5, 0)>, <3, (17, 7, 11)>, <3, (5, 10, 15)>, <4, (10, 11, 7)>, <5, (10, 15, 1)>, <5, (10, 15, 19)>, <5, (15, 10, 1)>, <5, (19, 5, 10)>, <6, (0, 19, 14)>, <7, (11, 17, 14)>, <10, (1, 4, 5)>, <10, (4, 11, 18)>, <14, (15, 7, 9)>, <15, (1, 10, 5)>, <15, (12, 14, 3)>
