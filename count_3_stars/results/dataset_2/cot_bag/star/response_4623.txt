Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 19:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 12, 19)>
<3, (0, 7, 12)>
<4, (9, 15, 18)>
<19, (2, 7, 11)>
