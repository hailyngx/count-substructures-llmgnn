Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors, which means they could be the center of a 3-star. Let's identify these nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 16, 2, 14 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has neighbors: 22, 24, 7 (3 neighbors) -> only 1 3-star
- Node 22 has neighbors: 13, 23, 25 (3 neighbors) -> only 1 3-star
- Node 2 has neighbors: 29, 23, 10 (3 neighbors) -> only 1 3-star
- Node 29 has neighbors: 20, 6, 2, 15 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has neighbors: 23, 27, 25, 28, 9 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 has neighbors: 22, 2, 3, 21, 0 (5 neighbors) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has neighbors: 29, 1, 19 (3 neighbors) -> only 1 3-star
- Node 28 has neighbors: 18, 3 (2 neighbors) -> no 3-star
- Node 7 has neighbors: 13, 1 (2 neighbors) -> no 3-star
- Node 24 has neighbors: 13, 0, 8, 1 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has neighbors: 16, 19, 9 (3 neighbors) -> only 1 3-star
- Node 15 has neighbors: 29, 12, 8, 14 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 has neighbors: 23, 19, 26, 9 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has neighbors: 10, 26, 4, 15 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 7, 20, 24 (4 neighbors) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<10, (11, 16, 14)>
<13, (22, 24, 7)>
<22, (13, 23, 25)>
<29, (20, 6, 15)>
<3, (23, 27, 25)>
<23, (22, 2, 21)>
<24, (13, 0, 8)>
<17, (16, 19, 9)>
<15, (29, 12, 14)>
<21, (23, 19, 26)>
<14, (10, 26, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 24)>
