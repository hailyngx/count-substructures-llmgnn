Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 4, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
