Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's determine the number of neighbors each node has:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors - {7, 12, 10, 13, 6, 2}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors - {5, 11, 14, 2, 13}
Node 2 has 6 neighbors - {4, 7, 12, 3, 0, 1}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors - {7, 12, 2}
Node 4 has 5 neighbors - {5, 12, 2, 6, 11}
Node 5 has 5 neighbors - {12, 1, 11, 4, 7}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors - {4, 11, 0, 13}
Node 7 has 5 neighbors - {5, 12, 0, 3, 2}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors - {14, 11}
Node 9 has 1 neighbor - {13}
Node 10 has 2 neighbors - {0, 13}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors - {5, 8, 1, 6, 4}
Node 12 has 6 neighbors - {5, 4, 7, 2, 0, 3}
Node 13 has 5 neighbors - {9, 0, 10, 1, 6}
Node 14 has 2 neighbors - {8, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars and list them:

- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <5, (12, 4, 7)>, <5, (12, 2, 1)>, <5, (12, 2, 11)>, <5, (12, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 11, 7)>, <5, (2, 11, 7)>, <5, (2, 11, 1)>, <5, (2, 1, 13)>, <5, (11, 1, 14)>

- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (4, 11, 0)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <6, (11, 0, 13)>, <6, (0, 13, 10)>

- Node 13 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <13, (0, 10, 1)>, <13, (0, 1, 14)>, <13, (0, 1, 2)>, <13, (10, 1, 6)>, <13, (10, 1, 4)>, <13, (1, 6, 14)>, <13, (1, 6, 2)>, <13, (1, 6, 11)>, <13, (6, 2, 11)>, <13, (6, 11, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars is [64].
