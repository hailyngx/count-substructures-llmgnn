Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Based on the given edges, Node 1 has neighbors {2, 6, 7, 11, 14}, Node 2 has neighbors {1, 5, 6, 10, 14}, Node 3 has neighbors {0, 4, 11, 12}, Node 4 has neighbors {3, 8, 10}, Node 5 has neighbors {2, 8, 12}, Node 6 has neighbors {1, 2, 13}, Node 7 has neighbors {0, 1, 9, 14}, Node 8 has neighbors {4, 5, 10, 13}, Node 9 has neighbors {7, 10, 14}, Node 10 has neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}, Node 11 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 12}, Node 12 has neighbors {3, 5, 11, 13, 14}, Node 13 has neighbors {6, 8, 12, 14}, Node 14 has neighbors {1, 7, 9, 12, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 4, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 5, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 6, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 10, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 11, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 12, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 13, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 14, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

In total, we have \(10+10+1+1+1+1+4+4+1+4+4+10+4+20 = 74\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
