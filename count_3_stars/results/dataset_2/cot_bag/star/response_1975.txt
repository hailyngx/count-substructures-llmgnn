Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 2) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 29) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 22) (15, 14) (20, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 5) (26, 0) (26, 2) (26, 16) (29, 22) (29, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 7) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 5) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 9) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 8) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 16) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 25) (4, 10) (4, 24) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 25) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 18) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 23) (9, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 13: \( C(2,3) = 0 \) 3-stars
5. Node 14: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 16: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 21: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 22: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 24: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 25: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 26: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star
12. Node 27: \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars
13. Node 29: \( C(2,3) = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars we found gives us a total of \( 4+10+10+4+1+4+10+4+4+1+10 = 52 \) 3-stars. 

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 21, 29)>, <4, (2, 19, 25)>, <5, (8, 16, 24)>, <14, (4, 12, 27)>, <16, (6, 26, 5)>, <21, (1, 27, 5)>, <22, (15, 19, 27)>, <24, (7, 4, 25)>, <25, (0, 18, 11)>, <26, (0, 2, 16)>, <27, (14, 18, 22)>
