Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, let's first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: {5, 4, 0, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {4, 7, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {5, 4, 0}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10] = [50] \)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (5, 4, 6)>
- <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- <5, (9, 2, 7)>
- <7, (5, 4, 8)>
- <7, (9, 0, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 3)>
