Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (6, 15) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 7, 15, 18, and 19.
        
        Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
        - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
        - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
        - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
        - Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
        - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
        - Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36
        
        So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
        
        Listing the unique 3-stars:
        <3, (12, 15, 19)>
        <4, (7, 18, 2)>
        <7, (2, 4, 18)>
        <15, (3, 17, 19)>
        <18, (2, 4, 8)>
        <19, (3, 12, 9)>
