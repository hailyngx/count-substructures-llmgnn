Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
Since we have 20 nodes, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Starting with node 0: 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 4, and 12. 
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 
1. <0, (8, 4, 19)>
2. <0, (8, 4, 12)>
3. <0, (8, 19, 12)>
4. <0, (4, 19, 12)>

Moving on to node 1: 
Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 4.
Node 1 does not form a 3-star.

Continuing with node 2: 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 14, 18, and 19.
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 2 as the center: 
5. <2, (5, 14, 18)>

Proceeding to node 3: 
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 12.
Node 3 does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 4: 
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 10, 14, 19, and 0.
There are 1 possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 
6. <4, (1, 10, 14)>

Moving on to node 5: 
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 9 and 2.
Node 5 does not form a 3-star.

Continuing with node 6: 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 7, 12, and 17.
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 6 as the center: 
7. <6, (7, 12, 17)>

Proceeding to node 7: 
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 17, 6, and 3.
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 7 as the center: 
8. <7, (17, 6, 3)>

Checking node 8: 
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 13, 19, 15, and 0.
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 8 as the center: 
9. <8, (13, 15, 19)>
10. <8, (13, 15, 0)>
11. <8, (13, 19, 0)>
12. <8, (15, 19, 0)>

Moving on to node 9: 
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 10.
Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Continuing with node 10: 
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 16, 9, and 4.
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 10 as the center: 
13. <10, (16, 9, 4)>

Proceeding to node 11: 
Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 13 and 17.
Node 11 does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 12: 
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 17, 6, 3, and 0.
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 12 as the center: 
14. <12, (17, 6, 3)>
15. <12, (17, 6, 0)>
16. <12, (17, 3, 0)>
17. <12, (6, 3, 0)>

Continuing with node 13: 
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 11, 8, and 15.
Node 13 does not form a 3-star.

Proceeding to node 14: 
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 17, 4, and 2.
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 14 as the center: 
18. <14, (17, 4, 2)>

Checking node 15: 
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 16, 8, and 13.
Node 15 does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 16: 
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 18, 10, and 15.
Node 16 does not form a 3-star.

Continuing with node 17: 
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 11, 14, 12, and 7.
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 17 as the center: 
19. <17, (11, 14, 12)>
20. <17, (11, 14, 7)>
21. <17, (11, 12, 7)>
22. <17, (14, 12, 7)>

Proceeding to node 18: 
Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 16 and 2.
Node 18 does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 19: 
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 4, and 0.
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 19 as the center: 
23. <19, (8, 2, 4)>
24. <19, (8, 2, 0)>
25. <19, (8, 4, 0)>
26. <19, (2, 4, 0)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [26].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 4, 19)>
<0, (8, 4, 12)>
<0, (8, 19, 12)>
<0, (4, 19, 12)>
<2, (5, 14, 18)>
<4, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (7, 12, 17)>
<7, (17, 6, 3)>
<8, (13, 15, 19)>
<8, (13, 15, 0)>
<8, (13, 19, 0)>
<8, (15, 19, 0)>
<10, (16, 9, 4)>
<12, (17, 6, 3)>
<12, (17, 6, 0)>
<12, (17, 3, 0)>
<12, (6, 3, 0)>
<14, (17, 4, 2)>
<17, (11, 14, 12)>
<17, (11, 14, 7)>

<19, (8, 2, 0)>
<19, (8, 4, 0)>
<19, (2, 4, 0)>
