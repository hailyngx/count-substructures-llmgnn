Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 9, 14, 18, 19, 2, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions gives a total of 38 3-stars:

\[ [38] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 14, 19)>
- <9, (15, 8, 2)>
- <9, (15, 8, 17)>
- <9, (15, 2, 17)>
- <9, (15, 17, 18)>
- <14, (1, 0, 5)>
- <14, (1, 5, 19)>
- <18, (11, 12, 19)>
- <18, (11, 13, 7)>
- <18, (12, 16, 19)>
- <18, (12, 18, 13)>
- <19, (1, 6, 16)>
- <19, (6, 16, 17)>
- <2, (10, 9, 17)>
- <7, (15, 6, 19)>
