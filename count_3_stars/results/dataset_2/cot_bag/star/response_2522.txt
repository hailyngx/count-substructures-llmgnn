Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 19) (21, 8) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 17) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 6) (22, 25) (8, 21) (8, 15) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 24) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (26, 28) (26, 25) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 20) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 19) (28, 2) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 29) (20, 16) (11, 12) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 3) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 10) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 26) (24, 13) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 14) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes available for creating 3-stars in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the given formula and the provided edges:   

For each node with three or more neighbors:   
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star <1, (21, 25, 16)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star <21, (1, 16, 13)> and 2 additional 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star <8, (21, 15, 27)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star <13, (21, 18, 24)> and 2 additional 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star <12, (27, 17, 6)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star <27, (8, 12, 24)> and 2 additional 3-stars
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star <20, (18, 27, 29)> and 2 additional 3-stars
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star <16, (1, 20, 0)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star <3, (23, 0, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star <4, (9, 24, 6)> and 3 additional 3-stars
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star <25, (1, 22, 26)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star <24, (13, 27, 17)> and 3 additional 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star <14, (19, 2, 10)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star <2, (28, 14, 4)> and 3 additional 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [27].
