Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 1) (9, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 1:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 3:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 7:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 10:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 11:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 12:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 14:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding up all the 3-stars we can form from these nodes, we get:
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [55] \]

So, there are a total of 55 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 14>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 14, 5>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 6, 12>
<2, 7, 13>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 10, 6>
<10, 1, 5>
