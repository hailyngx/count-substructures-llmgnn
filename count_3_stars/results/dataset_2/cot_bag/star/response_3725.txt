Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 9) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 13) (28, 21) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (15, 12) (15, 1) (8, 6) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (10, 27) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (11, 26) (11, 0) (0, 11) (3, 23) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 18) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 29) (2, 23) (2, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 4) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with three or more neighbors, which are: 
7, 21, 12, 26, 1, 15, 8, 9, 10, 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<7, (21, 18, 10)>, <7, (21, 9, 13)>, <7, (21, 10, 9)>, <7, (21, 13, 9)>, <7, (18, 12, 15)>, <7, (18, 21, 12)>, <7, (18, 21, 5)>, <7, (18, 12, 21)>, <7, (18, 5, 21)>, <7, (18, 12, 28)>

For node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<21, (7, 28, 10)>, <21, (7, 9, 13)>, <21, (7, 10, 19)>, <21, (7, 13, 29)>, <21, (7, 10, 27)>, <21, (28, 25, 4)>, <21, (28, 10, 19)>, <21, (28, 4, 29)>, <21, (28, 25, 6)>, <21, (28, 4, 5)>, <21, (10, 19, 27)>, <21, (10, 19, 26)>, <21, (10, 27, 14)>, <21, (19, 10, 27)>, <21, (19, 26, 11)>, <21, (19, 26, 20)>, <21, (26, 11, 0)>, <21, (26, 8, 29)>, <21, (26, 20, 16)>, <21, (26, 8, 9)>

For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<12, (7, 15, 18)>, <12, (7, 18, 16)>, <12, (15, 1, 16)>, <12, (18, 16, 5)>

For node 26: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<26, (19, 20, 11)>, <26, (19, 20, 16)>, <26, (19, 8, 29)>, <26, (19, 10, 27)>, <26, (20, 16, 24)>, <26, (20, 16, 18)>, <26, (20, 16, 1)>, <26, (20, 16, 4)>, <26, (11, 0, 26)>, <26, (11, 0, 29)>, <26, (11, 0, 4)>, <26, (8, 29, 13)>, <26, (8, 29, 4)>, <26, (8, 9, 3)>, <26, (8, 9, 21)>, <26, (8, 4, 29)>, <26, (9, 3, 23)>, <26, (9, 21, 13)>, <26, (9, 21, 10)>, <26, (9, 21, 7)>

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<1, (15, 16, 4)>, <1, (15, 12, 7)>, <1, (16, 17, 14)>, <1, (16, 17, 28)>, <1, (16, 17, 20)>, <1, (16, 24, 22)>, <1, (16, 24, 4)>, <1, (16, 24, 12)>, <1, (16, 18, 7)>, <1, (16, 18, 9)>

For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<15, (12, 1, 16)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (26, 9, 29)>, <8, (26, 25, 4)>, <8, (26, 20, 16)>, <8, (29, 13, 4)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (7, 21, 10)>, <9, (7, 21, 13)>, <9, (8, 29, 13)>, <9, (8, 29, 4)>

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (27, 14, 17)>, <10, (27, 14, 16)>, <10, (27, 14, 4)>, <10, (27, 14, 18)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (25, 24, 16)>, <4, (25, 6, 13)>, <4, (25, 6, 29)>, <4, (25, 6, 5)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 77.

Therefore, there are [77] 3-stars in the given graph.
