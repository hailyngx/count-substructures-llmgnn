Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 6, 5, 8, 2, 4
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 6, 4, 0
- Node 3: 7, 5, 8, 4
- Node 4: 6, 9, 3, 2, 0
- Node 5: 6, 1, 3, 8, 0, 7
- Node 6: 9, 5, 2, 4, 0
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 0, 7
- Node 9: 6, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].
