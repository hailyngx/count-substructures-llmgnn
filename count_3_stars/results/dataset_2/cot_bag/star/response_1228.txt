Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 9) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 18) (0, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 9) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (12, 17) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 14, 17, 4, 7, 18, 16, 11, 15, 13, and 5. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 69 \]

So, there are 69 total 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<4, (16, 19, 13)>, <5, (1, 11, 7)>, <7, (14, 11, 5)>, <9, (13, 17, 15)>, <11, (5, 14, 6)>, <13, (17, 19, 10)>, <14, (5, 7, 11)>, <16, (18, 4, 8)>, <17, (12, 9, 13)>, <18, (0, 15, 1)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [69].
