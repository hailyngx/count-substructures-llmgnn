Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using its nodes and connections as described:
  
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1)

Next, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 5, 10, 13) => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (6, 8, 10, 13, 12) => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (9, 5, 14, 3, 1) => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 12) => 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (6, 8, 4, 3, 10) => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (7, 10, 3, 12) => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors (9, 13, 0, 7, 4, 11) => inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (8, 5, 0, 11, 4) => inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (14, 12, 3, 1) => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 12, 3) => 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (8, 14, 11, 2) => inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 5, 0) => 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [72].
