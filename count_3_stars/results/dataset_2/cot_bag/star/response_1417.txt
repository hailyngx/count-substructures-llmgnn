Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 1) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 5) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 19) (11, 7) (11, 9) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 5) (16, 8) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \left[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \right] = [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4]. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ [48] = 48. \]

Therefore, there are 48 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (15, 2, 10)>
<2, (0, 8, 17)>
<3, (14, 6, 19)>
<4, (15, 14, 13)>
<5, (15, 6, 12)>
<6, (3, 6, 17)>
<7, (17, 18, 11)>
<8, (2, 8, 1)>
<12, (6, 14, 9)>
<15, (5, 0, 19)>
<17, (2, 5, 7)>
<19, (3, 15, 18)>
