Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 68 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 5)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
4. <4, (0, 7, 9)>
