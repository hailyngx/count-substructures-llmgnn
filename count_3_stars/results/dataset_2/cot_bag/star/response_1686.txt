Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (1, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. Let's go through the process:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (9, 12, 8, 11, 3, 4)
- Node 2: (6, 7, 8, 13, 14)
- Node 3: (12, 8, 13, 0, 4)
- Node 4: (14, 0, 3)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 12, 8)> <0, (9, 12, 11)> <0, (9, 12, 3)> <0, (9, 8, 11)> <0, (9, 8, 3)> 
<0, (9, 11, 3)> <0, (12, 8, 11)> <0, (12, 8, 3)> <0, (12, 11, 3)> <0, (8, 11, 3)> 
<2, (6, 7, 8)> <2, (6, 7, 13)> <2, (6, 7, 14)> <2, (6, 8, 13)> <2, (6, 8, 14)>
<2, (7, 8, 13)> <2, (7, 8, 14)> <2, (8, 13, 14)> 
<3, (12, 8, 13)> <3, (12, 8, 0)> <3, (12, 8, 4)> <3, (12, 13, 0)> <3, (12, 13, 4)>
<3, (8, 13, 0)> <3, (8, 13, 4)> <3, (13, 0, 4)>
<4, (14, 0, 3)>
