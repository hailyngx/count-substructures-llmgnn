Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 3}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {4}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12}

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 10)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 10)>, <1, (2, 8, 10)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 10)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <1, (6, 8, 10)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (4, 9, 0)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>, <2, (1, 6, 4)>, <2, (1, 6, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>, <2, (1, 9, 0)>, <2, (4, 9, 0)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
    - <3, (9, 11, 12)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 14)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 14)>, <4, (2, 7, 14)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 14)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
    - <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 14)>, <5, (4, 7, 14)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 14)>, <5, (1, 7, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (0, 10, 7)>, <5, (0, 10, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>, <5, (4, 10, 7)>, <5, (4, 10, 14)>, <5, (4, 7, 14)>, <5, (1, 10, 7)>, <5, (1, 10, 14)>, <5, (1, 7, 14)>, <5, (10, 7, 14)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <6, (2, 7, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 14)>, <6, (1, 7, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <7, (8, 12, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (10, 12, 14)>, <7, (5, 8, 12)>, <7, (5, 8, 14)>, <7, (5, 12, 14)>, <7, (10, 5, 12)>, <7, (10, 5, 14)>, <7, (10, 12, 14)>, <7, (8, 5, 14)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <8, (12, 14, 3)>, <8, (12, 14, 1)>, <8, (12, 14, 7)>, <8, (12, 3, 1)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
    - <12, (3, 8, 14)>
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
    - <14, (6, 7, 0)>, <14, (6, 7, 2)>, <14, (6, 7, 5)>, <14, (6, 0, 2)>, <14, (6, 0, 5)>, <14, (6, 2, 5)>, <14, (7, 0, 2)>, <14, (7, 0, 5)>, <14, (7, 2, 5)>, <14, (0, 2, 5)>, <14, (12, 8, 3)>, <14, (12, 8, 1)>, <14, (12, 8, 7)>, <14, (12, 3, 1)>, <14, (12, 3, 7)>, <14, (12, 1, 7)>, <14, (8, 1, 3)>, <14, (8, 1, 7)>, <14, (8, 3, 7)>, <14, (1, 3, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].
