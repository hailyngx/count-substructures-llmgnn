Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 3, 10, 11, 5, 13, 7, 12, 8, 4, 14, and 2.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 11)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 11, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 11)>, <6, (1, 2, 11)>, <6, (3, 2, 11)>, <6, (2, 11, 3)>, <6, (2, 11, 2)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 12)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 12)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 12)>, <9, (6, 7, 12)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 12)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>, <9, (8, 3, 12)>, <9, (8, 7, 12)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 12)>, <9, (4, 7, 12)>, <9, (3, 7, 12)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <1, (3, 4, 6)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (10, 11, 6)>, <3, (10, 11, 8)>, <3, (10, 6, 8)>, <3, (11, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (11, 14, 5)>, <10, (11, 14, 8)>, <10, (11, 5, 8)>, <10, (14, 5, 8)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <11, (8, 12, 10)>, <11, (8, 12, 13)>, <11, (8, 10, 13)>, <11, (12, 10, 13)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (2, 4, 10)>, <5, (2, 4, 13)>, <5, (2, 10, 13)>, <5, (4, 10, 13)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <13, (7, 10, 12)>, <13, (7, 10, 5)>, <13, (7, 12, 5)>, <13, (10, 12, 5)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <7, (2, 12, 13)>, <7, (2, 12, 0)>, <7, (2, 13, 0)>, <7, (12, 13, 0)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <12, (0, 8, 7)>, <12, (0, 8, 9)>, <12, (0, 7, 9)>, <12, (8, 7, 9)>, <12, (11, 13, 8)>, <12, (11, 13, 10)>, <12, (11, 8, 10)>, <12, (13, 8, 10)>, <12, (4, 9, 8)>, <12, (4, 9, 11)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (3, 11, 14)>, <8, (3, 11, 12)>, <8, (3, 14, 12)>, <8, (11, 14, 12)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <8, (4, 9, 14)>, <8, (4, 12, 14)>, <8, (9, 12, 14)>, <8, (6, 2, 7)>, <8, (6, 2, 12)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (1, 5, 9)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars found for each node, we get:
\[ [10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4] = [72] \]
