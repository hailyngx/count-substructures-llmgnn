Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 6, 2, 5.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 5, 8, 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 1 as center: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 6, 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 3 as center: <3, (1, 7, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>.

For nodes 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 6, 2, 5:
- These nodes have 4 neighbors each, forming 4 unique 3-stars with each of them as the center.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4*7 = 10 + 4 + 28 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].
