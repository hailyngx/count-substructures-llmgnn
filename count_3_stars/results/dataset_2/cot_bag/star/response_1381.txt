Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 24) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 26) (7, 27) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 26) (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (28, 1) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 21) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 19) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 27) (10, 19) (21, 8) (21, 0) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 2) (24, 16) (24, 6) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 29) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 21) (0, 15) (15, 29) (15, 0) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (27, 7) (27, 10) (27, 19) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 2) (19, 23) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph, which are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 29. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are a total of 44 different 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
