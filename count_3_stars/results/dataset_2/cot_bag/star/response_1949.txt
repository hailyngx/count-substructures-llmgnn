Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 11) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with 5 neighbors
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 5 neighbors
- Node 7 with 6 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 4 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 13 with 5 neighbors
- Node 14 with 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 75 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [75]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 14)>
- <0, (1, 4, 13)>
- <0, (1, 4, 12)>
- <0, (1, 4, 14)>
- <0, (1, 12, 13)>
- <1, (0, 4, 13)>
- <1, (0, 4, 12)>
- <1, (0, 12, 13)>
- <2, (4, 10, 14)>
- <4, (0, 1, 13)>
- <4, (0, 1, 12)>
- <4, (0, 12, 13)>
- <6, (2, 4, 10)>
- <7, (0, 1, 14)>
- <10, (2, 4, 6)>
- <13, (0, 1, 4)>
- <14, (0, 1, 7)>
