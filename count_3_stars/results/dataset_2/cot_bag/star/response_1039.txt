Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 25) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 23) (25, 3) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 21) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 14) (20, 5) (20, 10) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 20) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 27) (10, 20) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 28) (17, 28) (17, 7) (28, 19) (28, 17) (28, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (6, 16) (24, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 21) (9, 0) (9, 15) (21, 22) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 2) (5, 20) (5, 0) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 29) (12, 28) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 24) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 18, 23, 19, 21
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 22, 8, 25
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 25, 7, 4
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 23, 3, 2
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 23, 29, 15, 21
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 14, 4, 19
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 14, 16, 27, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 1, 26, 21
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 26, 14, 10, 13
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 14, 5, 10
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 8, 16, 12, 11
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 1, 26, 27, 20
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 27, 20, 15
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 22, 1, 2, 28
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 19, 17, 12
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 17, 15
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 26, 29, 6, 2
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 8, 7, 9, 13
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 25, 19, 16, 21
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 15
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 22, 8, 4, 2
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 20, 0
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 29, 28
- Node 24 has 1 neighbor: 13
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 16
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 13, 9

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1. For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. For Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. For Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [40] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, 23, 29>, <26, 14, 27>, <3, 4, 25>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 21>, <25, 2, 3>, <25, 2, 19>, <25, 2, 16>, <22, 19, 2>, <22, 19, 28>, <22, 1, 19>, <22, 1, 4>, <22, 1, 14>, <22, 18, 23>, <8, 29, 16>, <8, 29, 12>, <8, 29, 11>, <8, 29, 16>, <4, 26, 14>, <4, 26, 27>, <4, 21, 2>, <27, 14, 20>, <14, 20, 10>, <19, 28, 17>, <3, 7, 17>, <9, 0, 15>, <21, 4, 2> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
