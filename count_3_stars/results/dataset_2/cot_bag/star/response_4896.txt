Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
The node degrees are:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 (degree 4):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
<Node 1, (8, 6, 7)>

Node 2 (degree 4):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
<Node 2, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 6 (degree 4):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
<Node 6, (4, 1, 0)>

Node 8 (degree 6):
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 3-stars
<Node 8, (4, 9, 5)> <Node 8, (5, 4, 3)> <Node 8, (9, 4, 0)> <Node 8, (3, 4, 8)> <Node 8, (9, 0, 2)> <Node 8, (0, 9, 1)>

Node 9 (degree 5):
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars
<Node 9, (4, 8, 0)> <Node 9, (8, 4, 1)> <Node 9, (4, 3, 8)> <Node 9, (3, 4, 9)> <Node 9, (8, 1, 2)> <Node 9, (1, 8, 7)> <Node 9, (2, 0, 6)> <Node 9, (0, 2, 9)> <Node 9, (2, 1, 7)> <Node 9, (1, 2, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10] = 42.
