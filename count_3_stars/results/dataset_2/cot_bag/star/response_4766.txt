Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   9 ---- 8 --- 7 --- 5
   |     /|   /  /   |
   |    / |  /  /    |
   |   /  | /  /     |
   |  /   |/  /      |
   0 --- 3 --- 1 --- 6
     \   |     \
      \  |      \
       \ |       \
         4
```

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for node 0, we find 10 3-stars originating from node 0.
Calculating \( \binom{6}{3} \) for node 1, we find 20 3-stars originating from node 1.
Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for node 3, we find 4 3-stars originating from node 3.
Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for node 4, we find 1 3-star originating from node 4.
Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for node 6, we find 1 3-star originating from node 6.
Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for node 7, we find 10 3-stars originating from node 7.
Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for node 8, we find 1 3-star originating from node 8.
Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for node 9, we find 10 3-stars originating from node 9.

Adding these up, we get a total of 57 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are:
