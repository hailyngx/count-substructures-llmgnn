Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 28) (6, 29) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 20) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 3) (22, 24) (22, 19) (22, 12) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 2) (16, 23) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 8) (18, 19) (18, 8) (25, 15) (25, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 1) (28, 17) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 20) (8, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 14) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 10) (20, 23) (20, 12) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 23) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 15, 19, 24, 26, and 29.

Let's find the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 33

So, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, 9, 21>, <9, 5, 21>, <9, 2, 10>, <9, 10, 2>, <15, 11, 17>, <15, 17, 11>, <15, 19, 22>, <15, 22, 19>, <19, 10, 20>, <19, 20, 10>, <19, 22, 18>, <19, 18, 22>, <24, 5, 21>, <24, 21, 5>, <24, 14, 28>, <24, 28, 14>, <26, 4, 21>, <26, 21, 4>, <26, 17, 28>, <26, 28, 17>, <29, 6, 8>, <29, 8, 6>, <29, 12, 25>, <29, 25, 12>
