Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
For Node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For Node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For Node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 7:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
For Node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For Node 13:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For Node 14:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding these up:
\[ 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 96 \]

Since we found 96 3-stars in the graph, we can represent them as follows:
\[ [96] \]
Unique 3-stars:
