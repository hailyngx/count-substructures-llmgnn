Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three neighbors: nodes 5, 6, and 7. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 7). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 0). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \), which can be represented as [9].
The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>.
