Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 8) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 18) (8, 2) (8, 28) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 9) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 23) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (23, 19) (23, 11) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (9, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 6) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 10) (7, 1) (7, 14) (21, 13) (21, 5) (20, 9) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 27) (22, 10) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 14) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 21) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 3, 0, 27, 1, 26, 4, 18, 26, 17, 26, 19, 4, 26, 11, 13, 26, 29, 6, 12, 16, 26, 23, 19, 17, 27, 11, 13, 17, 9, 19, 23, 11, 16, and 25.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and sum them up:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{3} = 72 \]

So, there are a total of 72 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, 15, 28>, 
<0, 16, 11>, 
<27, 22, 17>, 
<1, 26, 7>, 
<4, 18, 12>, 
<19, 26, 23>, 
<17, 13, 9>, 
<11, 26, 23>, 
<16, 12, 6>, and 
<25, 14, 5>.

Putting this final count inside brackets gives us: [72].
