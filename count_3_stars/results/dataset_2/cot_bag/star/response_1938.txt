Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 18) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 17) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 16) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 11, 16, 3, 15, 8, 13, 4, 14, 5, 0, 7, 17, 2, 12, 6, 19, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 39 3-stars. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
