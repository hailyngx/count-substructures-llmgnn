Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 72.
