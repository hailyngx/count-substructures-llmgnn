Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
Firstly, let's draw the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

```
         7----1----2
         |         | \
         |         |  \
         14---6---5---0
          \  |   |     
           \ |   |    
              10--9    
             /|   |     
            / |   |    
         4---13 12--11
          \         
           \        
             3
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [52].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<6, (9, 11, 3)>
<6, (9, 12, 4)>
<6, (11, 14, 3)>
<6, (12, 10, 1)>
<6, (12, 11, 13)>
<6, (14, 3, 7)>
<11, (6, 14, 3)>
<11, (6, 4, 10)>
<11, (0, 12, 2)>
<11, (0, 2, 1)>
<12, (9, 11, 6)>
<12, (9, 13, 4)>
<12, (13, 4, 10)>
<12, (13, 1, 10)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
