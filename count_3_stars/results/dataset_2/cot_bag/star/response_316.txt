Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed. Let's list all the nodes with their neighbors:

1: 5, 8, 0  
2: 6, 4  
3: 5, 6, 4, 8  
4: 5, 7, 3, 2, 0  
5: 9, 8, 1, 4, 3  
6: 9, 3, 2, 8, 0  
7: 9, 4, 8  
8: 5, 6, 7, 3, 1  
9: 5, 6, 7, 0  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

1: inom{3}{3} = 1  
2: inom{2}{3} = 0  
3: inom{4}{3} = 4  
4: inom{5}{3} = 10  
5: inom{5}{3} = 10  
6: inom{5}{3} = 10  
7: inom{3}{3} = 1  
8: inom{5}{3} = 10  
9: inom{4}{3} = 4  

Adding these up: 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 50

So, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 8, 1)>  
<4, (5, 7, 8)>  
<5, (9, 8, 1)>  
<5, (9, 8, 3)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<5, (4, 3, 8)>  
<6, (9, 2, 0)>  
<6, (3, 2, 8)>  
<8, (5, 7, 3)>  
<8, (5, 1, 0)>
