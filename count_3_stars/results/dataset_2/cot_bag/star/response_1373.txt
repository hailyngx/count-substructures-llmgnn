Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is found by iterating through each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's calculate it:

For node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (6, 2, 8, 1). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. Thus, we have 4 3-stars.

For node 9: This node has 5 neighbors (4, 2, 1, 7, 0). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. Thus, we have 10 3-stars.

For node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 6). So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center. Thus, we have 1 3-star.

For node 7: This node has 5 neighbors (9, 0, 3, 2, 8). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center. Thus, we have 10 3-stars.

For node 1: This node has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 6). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. Thus, we have 4 3-stars.

For node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (7, 6, 8). So, there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center. Thus, we have 1 3-star.

For node 8: This node has 5 neighbors (5, 7, 3, 2, 0). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. Thus, we have 10 3-stars.

For node 6: This node has 4 neighbors (5, 4, 1, 3). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. Thus, we have 4 3-stars.

For node 2: This node has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 8). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. Thus, we have 4 3-stars.

For node 0: This node has 3 neighbors (9, 7, 8). So, there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center. Thus, we have 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 49 3-stars in this graph, which we represent as [49].
