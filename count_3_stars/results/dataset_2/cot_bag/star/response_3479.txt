Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (6, 7, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <6, (9, 2, 1)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 1, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
