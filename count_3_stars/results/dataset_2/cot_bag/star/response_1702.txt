Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
4, 7, 6, 9, 11, 12, 0, 2, 5, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
4: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
0: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
13: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
