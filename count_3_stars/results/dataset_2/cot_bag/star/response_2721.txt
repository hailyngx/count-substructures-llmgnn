Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 5) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with 3 or more neighbors are:  
- Node 0: neighbors {16, 10, 14, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {11, 8, 6, 13}
- Node 3: neighbors {11, 0, 13, 18}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 19}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 17}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 18, 13}
- Node 7: neighbors {12, 0, 14}
- Node 8: neighbors {9, 1}
- Node 9: neighbors {8, 17}
- Node 10: neighbors {17, 0, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {3, 1, 19}
- Node 13: neighbors {12, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 14: neighbors {10, 7, 15}
- Node 16: neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 17: neighbors {5, 9, 10, 18}
- Node 18: neighbors {17, 3, 15, 6}
- Node 19: neighbors {4, 2, 11}

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula, the total number of 3-stars is:

\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (16, 10, 14)>
<1, (11, 8, 13)>
<3, (11, 13, 18)>
<4, (5, 19, -)>
<5, (4, 17, -)>
<6, (1, 18, 13)>
<7, (12, 14, -)>
<9, (8, 17, -)>
<10, (17, 0, 14)>
<11, (3, 1, 19)>
<13, (12, 1, 6)>
<14, (10, 7, 15)>
<16, (0, 2, -)>
<17, (5, 9, 18)>
