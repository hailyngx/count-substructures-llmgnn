Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: 5, 4, 8, 0, 7
2: 9, 7, 8, 0
3: 6, 7, 8
4: 5, 6, 1, 7
5: 9, 6, 1, 4
6: 5, 9, 3, 4
7: 9, 1, 3, 4, 0, 2
8: 1, 3, 2
9: 5, 2, 7, 0

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars formed:

For node 5, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (4, 9, 6)>
For node 9, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 1)>, <9, (2, 0, 7)>, <9, (7, 0, 1)>
For node 1, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 0, 8)>
For node 4, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (7, 1, 5)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 5, 3)>
For node 7, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <7, (4, 1, 9)>, <7, (4, 1, 3)>, <7, (4, 1, 0)>, <7, (9, 1, 0)>, <7, (4, 9, 0)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>
For node 0, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (9, 1, 7)>, <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <0, (1, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 7, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [30]

Unique 3-stars formed: 
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 6)>
<5, (4, 9, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)>
<9, (2, 7, 1)>
<9, (2, 0, 7)>
<9, (7, 0, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 5, 3)>
<7, (4, 1, 9)>
<7, (4, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
<7, (9, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<7, (9, 0, 2)>
<7, (1, 0, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 1, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
