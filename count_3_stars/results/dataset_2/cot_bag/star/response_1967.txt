Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 15) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 8) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (6, 14) (6, 15) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 13) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three of more neighbors: node 5, node 14, and node 16. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5:
There are 5 neighbors of node 5: 9, 19, 18, 0, and 10.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<5, (9, 19, 18)>, <5, (9, 19, 0)>, <5, (9, 19, 10)>, <5, (9, 18, 0)>, <5, (9, 18, 10)>, <5, (9, 0, 10)>, <5, (19, 18, 0)>, <5, (19, 18, 10)>, <5, (19, 0, 10)>, <5, (18, 0, 10)>

For node 14:
There are 4 neighbors of node 14: 11, 9, 17, and 6.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<14, (11, 9, 17)>, <14, (11, 9, 6)>, <14, (11, 17, 6)>, <14, (9, 17, 6)>

For node 16:
There are 4 neighbors of node 16: 7, 18, 2, and 3.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<16, (7, 18, 2)>, <16, (7, 18, 3)>, <16, (7, 2, 3)>, <16, (18, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \).
