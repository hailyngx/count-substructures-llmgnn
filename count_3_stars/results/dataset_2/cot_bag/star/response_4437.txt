Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 11: 5 neighbors
Node 16: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 10: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 17: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<11, (16, 17, 6)>, <11, (17, 6, 0)>, <11, (6, 0, 4)>, <11, (0, 4, 17)>, <11, (4, 17, 16)>, <11, (16, 17, 11)>, <11, (17, 11, 16)>, <11, (11, 16, 17)>, <11, (16, 11, 17)>, <11, (11, 17, 16)>

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<1, (13, 7, 18)>

Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (6, 5, 13)>, <10, (6, 5, 10)>, <10, (6, 10, 5)>, <10, (5, 13, 7)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (0, 8, 17)>

Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (10, 5, 13)>, <6, (10, 5, 6)>, <6, (10, 6, 5)>, <6, (5, 13, 7)>, <6, (5, 13, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (13, 7, 1)>, <6, (10, 6, 17)>, <6, (6, 17, 2)>, <6, (17, 2, 9)>

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (5, 7, 1)>, <13, (5, 7, 2)>, <13, (7, 2, 19)>, <13, (2, 19, 14)>

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (6, 17, 9)>, <2, (6, 17, 2)>, <2, (6, 2, 9)>, <2, (17, 2, 9)>

Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<17, (4, 6, 2)>, <17, (4, 6, 17)>, <17, (6, 2, 9)>, <17, (6, 2, 17)>, <17, (2, 9, 16)>, <17, (6, 17, 11)>, <17, (17, 11, 16)>, <17, (11, 16, 17)>, <17, (16, 17, 11)>, <17, (17, 11, 16)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph you provided is 44.
