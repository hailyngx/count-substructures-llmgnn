Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the edges given, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. So we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 5 neighbors of node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
Number of 3-stars involving node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 1:
There are 5 neighbors of node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars involving node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2: 0, 1, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars involving node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
There are 5 neighbors of node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars involving node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
There are 3 neighbors of node 4: 6, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
There are 4 neighbors of node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5
Number of 3-stars involving node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 8:
There are 5 neighbors of node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9, 2
Number of 3-stars involving node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 9:
There are 4 neighbors of node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8
Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [53].
