Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 25) (27, 18) (27, 2) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 24) (1, 6) (1, 0) (20, 11) (20, 10) (25, 15) (25, 21) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 29) (17, 4) (17, 23) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 28) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (9, 2) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 12) (22, 9) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 14) (28, 13) (13, 5) (13, 28) (13, 11) (11, 20) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 21) (12, 4) (12, 9) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 10) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 16) (24, 0) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 10) (0, 1) (0, 24) (23, 29) (23, 17) (23, 9) (10, 20) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors 27, 9, and 4.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 8, 18, 12, and 17.
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 8, 5, 14, and 11.
- Node 8 has neighbors 4, 28, 24, 6, and 17.
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 22, 23, and 12.
- Node 11 has neighbors 20, 6, 13, and 21.
- Node 14 has neighbors 6, 28, 16, and 10.
- Node 16 has neighbors 7, 24, and 14.
- Node 17 has neighbors 29, 4, 23, and 18.
- Node 18 has neighbors 27, 4, 19, and 10.
- Node 19 has neighbors 26, 18, 7, and 28.
- Node 23 has neighbors 29, 17, 9.
- Node 24 has neighbors 29, 8, 16, and 0.
- Node 25 has neighbors 15, 21.
- Node 26 has neighbors 15, 19, 28.
- Node 28 has neighbors 8, 19, 26, 14, and 13.
- Node 29 has neighbors 17, 23, 24.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 24 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 28 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 5 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the contributions, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 57 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (27, 9, 4)>, <4, (2, 8, 6)>, <6, (1, 8, 11)>, <8, (4, 28, 16)>, <9, (2, 22, 23)>, <11, (20, 6, 13)>, <14, (6, 28, 16)>, <16, (7, 24, 14)>, <17, (29, 4, 23)>, <18, (27, 19, 10)>, <19, (26, 18, 7)>, <23, (29, 17, 9)>, <24, (29, 8, 16)>, <26, (15, 19, 28)>, <28, (8, 19, 26)>
