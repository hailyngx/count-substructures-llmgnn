Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 54. 

Therefore, the final answer is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<1, 0, 7>
<2, 1, 10>
<3, 2, 13>
<4, 3, 12>
<5, 2, 6>
<7, 5, 9>
<10, 8, 4>
<12, 9, 13>
<14, 5, 10>
