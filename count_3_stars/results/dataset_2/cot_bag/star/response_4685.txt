Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

Let's first draw the graph based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 5 forms a 3-star with the leaves 1, 4, and 9: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with the leaves 4, 6, and 8: <9, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with the leaves 6, 8, and 9: <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
