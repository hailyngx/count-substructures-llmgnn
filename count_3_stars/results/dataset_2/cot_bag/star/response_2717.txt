Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Each node and its neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 0, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 2, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3, 0}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 1 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (9, 8, 7)>, <0, (9, 2, 6)>, <0, (9, 2, 4)>, <0, (9, 8, 5)>, <0, (2, 7, 6)>, <0, (2, 7, 4)>, <0, (2, 8, 5)>, <0, (8, 7, 5)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 4)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (9, 3, 0)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 0)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <7, (2, 8, 0)>
