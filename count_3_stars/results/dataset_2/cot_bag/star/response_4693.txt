Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 109

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [109].

The unique 3-stars are:
