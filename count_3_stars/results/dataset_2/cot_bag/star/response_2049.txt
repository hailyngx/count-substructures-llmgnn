Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7} - can form 1 3-star
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8} - can form 1 3-star
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8} - can form 1 3-star
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 9} - can form 1 3-star
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9} - can form 1 3-star
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9} - can form 1 3-star
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9} - can form 1 3-star
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5} - cannot form a 3-star
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4} - cannot form a 3-star
Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6} - can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
