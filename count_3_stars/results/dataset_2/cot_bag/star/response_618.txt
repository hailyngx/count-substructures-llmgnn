Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 88 \)

So, there are a total of 88 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:

[88]  
<1, (5, 6, 14)>  
<6, (1, 9, 7)>  
<7, (5, 9, 13)>  
<8, (0, 3, 10)>  
<10, (6, 8, 13)>  
<11, (13, 14, 2)>  
<13, (8, 10, 7)>  
<14, (0, 6, 3)>
