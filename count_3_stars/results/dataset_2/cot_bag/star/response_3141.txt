Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: (0)   
2: (15, 16)  
3: (6, 7)  
4: (8, 9, 18)   
5: (16)  
6: (3, 13)    
7: (3, 17, 8, 19)   
8: (4, 7, 12)  
9: (1, 4, 14)   
10: (11, 16, 17, 19)  
11: (10, 13, 14, 15, 18)  
12: (0, 8, 18)  
13: (6, 11, 1, 19)  
14: (9, 11, 0, 16)  
15: (2, 11)  
16: (2, 5, 10, 14)  
17: (10, 7)  
18: (4, 12, 11)  
19: (10, 7, 13)  

Now let's determine the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

Node 4 forms 1 3-star. <4, (8, 9, 18)>

Node 7 forms 2 3-stars. <7, (3, 17, 8)> <7, (3, 10, 19)>

Node 10 forms 1 3-star. <10, (16, 17, 19)>

Node 11 forms 5 3-stars. <11, (13, 14, 18)> <11, (13, 15, 2)> <11, (13, 1, 9)> <11, (14, 0, 16)> <11, (14, 18, 12)>

Node 13 forms 1 3-star. <13, (1, 6, 19)>

Node 16 forms 2 3-stars. <16, (2, 14, 5)> <16, (2, 10, 14)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [12].
