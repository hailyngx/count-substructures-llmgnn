Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) 
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
(4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) 
(7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
(6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
(8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) 
(2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) 
(3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
(0, 6) (0, 3) 
(1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Now, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors in order to calculate the total number of 3-stars. The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

For node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (1 unique 3-star)
For node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
For node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (10 unique 3-stars)
For node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
For node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) (10 unique 3-stars)
For node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
For node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (9, 1, 8)>
<2, (4, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 3, 1)>
<3, (4, 3, 8)>
<3, (7, 3, 9)>
<4, (7, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (9, 1, 6)>
