Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 43 \). 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [43].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
