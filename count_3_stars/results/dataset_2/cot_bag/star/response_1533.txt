Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will analyze each node to determine how many 3-stars can be formed with it as the central node.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 10, 13, 4.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 7, 0, 14, 6, 5.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 0, 8, 5.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 9, 5, 8, 12.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 12, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 10, 11, 2, 9, 7.
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 10, 11, 6, 7.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 13, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 8, 13, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 12, 9.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 80.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 7, 0)>, <10, (1, 0, 8)>, <11, (7, 9, 5)>, <8, (10, 11, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 10)>, <6, (3, 5, 13)>, <0, (3, 10, 12)>, <14, (3, 7, 9)>.
