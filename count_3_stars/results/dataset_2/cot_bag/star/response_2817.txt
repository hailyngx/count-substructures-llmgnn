Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 3, 2
Node 1: 5, 4, 3, 2
Node 2: 9, 1, 3, 0
Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 0
Node 4: 5, 9, 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 9, 1, 4
Node 6: 7, 3, 8
Node 7: 9, 0, 6, 8
Node 8: 7, 6
Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 7, 0, 1

There are no nodes with less than three neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 2: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 3: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
Node 4: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
Node 5: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
Node 6: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 8: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$
Node 9: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 20 = 70$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [70].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (4, 1, 5)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 0, 3)>, <1, (4, 3, 9)>, <2, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (9, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 0, 4)>, <3, (9, 4, 5)>, <3, (9, 5, 1)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (7, 3, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 2, 4)>.
