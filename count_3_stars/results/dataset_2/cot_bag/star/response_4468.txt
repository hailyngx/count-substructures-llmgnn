Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges based on the given information:
```
    0 --- 1
   /|    /|
  3 |   4 |
   \|   \|
    5 --- 2
     \   /
      \7/
       6
      /|\
     9 | 8
       \| 
        
```  
Based on the graph structure, we can determine the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 9, 7)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 5)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7, 2)

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1]
  - <0, (1, 3, 5)>

- Node 1: [1]
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>

- Node 2: [1]
  - <2, (1, 4, 9)>

- Node 3: [0]

- Node 4: [1]
  - <4, (1, 2, 9)>

- Node 5: [2]
  - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 6: [1]
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 7: [0]

- Node 8: [1]
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)>

- Node 9: [2]
  - <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [9].
