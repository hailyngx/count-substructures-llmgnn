Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, 9  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 9  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 9  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6  

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star
- Node 0: Only 1 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-stars
- Node 7: \({3 \choose 3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 9: Only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
