Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (5, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 12) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 8) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 8) (8, 16) (8, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:  
Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 6), (3, 12), (12, 3), (15, 3), (6, 3)  
Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 17), (7, 4), (9, 4), (13, 4), (17, 4)  
Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 18), (6, 13), (3, 6), (5, 6), (1, 6), (13, 6), (18, 6)  
Node 7: (7, 15), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 17), (15, 7), (4, 7), (0, 7), (17, 7)  
Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 15), (12, 14), (12, 18), (12, 16), (3, 12), (15, 12), (14, 12), (18, 12), (16, 12)  
Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 2), (4, 13), (6, 13), (1, 13), (2, 13)  
Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 7), (15, 14), (15, 12), (3, 15), (7, 15), (14, 15), (12, 15)  
Node 16: (16, 14), (16, 12), (16, 8), (14, 16), (12, 16), (8, 16)  
Node 17: (17, 4), (17, 7), (17, 10), (17, 0), (4, 17), (7, 17), (10, 17), (0, 17)  
Node 18: (18, 6), (18, 11), (12, 18), (6, 18), (11, 18)  
Node 19: (19, 9), (19, 11), (9, 19), (11, 19)  

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{10}{3} = 120 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{10}{3} = 120 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
Node 15: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 17: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 56 + 120 + 56 + 120 + 56 + 56 + 1 + 56 + 10 + 4 = 555  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [555].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (15, 6, 12)>  
<4, (7, 9, 13)>  
<6, (3, 5, 1)>  
<7, (15, 4, 0)>  
<12, (3, 15, 14)>  
<13, (4, 6, 1)>  
<15, (3, 7, 14)>  
<16, (14, 12, 8)>  
<17, (4, 7, 10)>  
<18, (6, 11, 12)>  
<19, (9, 11, 19)>
