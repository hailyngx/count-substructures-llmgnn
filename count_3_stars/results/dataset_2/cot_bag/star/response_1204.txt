Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 2) (11, 19) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 19) (2, 14) (2, 6) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 18) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4, 10  
Node 1: 3, 16  
Node 2: 6, 14  
Node 3: 1, 13, 17  
Node 4: 0, 14, 19  
Node 5: 7, 17  
Node 6: 2, 16  
Node 7: 5, 9, 16, 17  
Node 8: 12, 15, 16, 19  
Node 9: 7, 12, 15  
Node 10: 0, 12, 13, 16  
Node 11: 19  
Node 12: 8, 9, 10, 18  
Node 13: 3, 10, 18  
Node 14: 2, 4, 15  
Node 15: 8, 9, 14, 19  
Node 16: 1, 6, 7, 8, 10  
Node 17: 3, 5, 7  
Node 18: 12, 13  
Node 19: 4, 8, 11, 15

There are 6 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 7, 8, 12, 15, and 16.

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (1, 13, 17)>  
<7, (5, 9, 16)>  
<8, (12, 15, 19)>  
<12, (8, 9, 18)>  
<15, (8, 9, 19)>  
<16, (1, 7, 10)>  
<16, (1, 7, 8)>  
<16, (1, 8, 10)>  
<16, (6, 7, 10)>  
<16, (6, 7, 8)>  
<16, (6, 8, 10)>
