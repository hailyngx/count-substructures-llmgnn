Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 58 3-stars. So, we have \[ 58 \] 3-stars in this graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
