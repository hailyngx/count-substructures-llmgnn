Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 5, 0, 8, and 3.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41

Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
