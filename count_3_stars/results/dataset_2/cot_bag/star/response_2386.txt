Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 28 \]

Therefore, we have a total of [28] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
