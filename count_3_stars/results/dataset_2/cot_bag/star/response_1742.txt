Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which are nodes 4, 6, 9, 12, 5, 2, 8, 0, 14, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<4, (5, 14, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<12, (2, 0, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 11)>
<5, (8, 11, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<2, (12, 10, 3)>
<8, (9, 5, 11)>
<8, (5, 11, 1)>
<8, (8, 11, 1)>
<0, (12, 5, 13)>
<0, (5, 1, 13)>
<0, (12, 13, 1)>
<14, (4, 7, 13)>
<14, (7, 9, 13)>
<14, (9, 13, 1)>
<1, (8, 11, 13)>
<1, (11, 13, 1)>
