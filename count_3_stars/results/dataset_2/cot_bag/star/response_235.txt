Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (25, 5) (25, 21) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 2) (12, 24) (12, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (26, 23) (26, 5) (26, 11) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 21) (13, 23) (13, 9) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 18) (28, 15) (9, 13) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 0) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (18, 28) (18, 21) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 8) (17, 23) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 15) (16, 29) (16, 17) (16, 1) (20, 8) (20, 21) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 8) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 4) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 18) (21, 8) (21, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 28) (14, 1) (11, 26) (11, 27) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 10) (4, 15) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5: <5, (25, 21, 8)>
2. Node 8: <8, (5, 24, 21)>
3. Node 10: <10, (22, 4, 1)>
4. Node 12: <12, (24, 19, 9)>
5. Node 15: <15, (28, 6, 4)>
6. Node 16: <16, (29, 17, 1)>
7. Node 17: <17, (23, 6, 0)>
8. Node 21: <21, (25, 5, 18)>
9. Node 24: <24, (12, 19, 9)>
10. Node 26: <26, (23, 5, 11)>
11. Node 28: <28, (0, 14, 18)>
12. Node 29: <29, (27, 0, 16)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars in total, as calculated. So the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
