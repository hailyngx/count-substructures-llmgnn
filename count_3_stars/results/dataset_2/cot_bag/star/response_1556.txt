Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges:
- 0: (27), (15), (9)
- 1: (25), (29), (19)
- 2: (25)
- 3: (27), (17), (28), (21)
- 4: (18), (29), (14)
- 5: (27), (22), (24)
- 6: (9), (15), (12)
- 7: (11), (10), (25), (25)
- 8: (11), (28), (26), (29)
- 9: (0), (6)
- 10: (17), (7), (23)
- 11: (16), (24), (7), (8)
- 12: (6), (20), (13)
- 13: (12)
- 14: (17), (4)
- 15: (0), (6), (14), (23), (24)
- 16: (11), (21)
- 17: (14), (17), (3)
- 18: (4), (26), (23)
- 19: (21), (1)
- 20: (27), (12)
- 21: (16), (25), (3), (19)
- 22: (5)
- 23: (18), (10), (29), (15)
- 24: (11), (5), (15)
- 25: (7), (26), (25), (1), (2)
- 26: (18), (25), (8)
- 27: (0), (3), (20), (5)
- 28: (3), (8)
- 29: (4), (1), (8), (23)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [3 3-stars]
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [44]
