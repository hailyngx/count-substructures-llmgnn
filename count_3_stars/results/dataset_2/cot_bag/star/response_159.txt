Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph according to the given criteria:

For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
For Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 60 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 2, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 2, 3)>, <1, (7, 2, 5)>, <1, (7, 3, 5)>, <1, (7, 4, 8)>, <1, (7, 5, 2)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 0, 1)>, <5, (3, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 2, 1)>, <5, (7, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 9, 7)>, <8, (2, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 0, 3)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
