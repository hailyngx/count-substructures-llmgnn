Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these together, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 22 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
3. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
4. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
7. <1, (5, 6, 7)>
8. <1, (9, 3, 6)>
9. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
10. <2, (0, 8, 7)>
11. <2, (1, 6, 7)>
12. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
13. <3, (1, 6, 7)> 
14. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
15. <3, (6, 7, 9)>
16. <3, (7, 9, 5)>
17. <9, (1, 3, 6)>
18. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
19. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
20. <9, (5, 7, 1)>
21. <4, (8, 9, 3)>
22. <8, (0, 7, 2)>
