Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 5 and 9 neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 4, 14, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
- The neighbors of node 5 are 9, 13, 2, 1, 0.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
- Unique 3-stars involving node 5 are <5, (9, 13, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (13, 2, 1)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>.
  
For node 9:
- The neighbors of node 9 are 5, 6, 4, 11, 14.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.
- Unique 3-stars involving node 9 are <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (6, 4, 11)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>, <9, (11, 14, 5)>.

For node 4:
- The neighbors of node 4 are 9, 7, 12, 14, 3.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
- Unique 3-stars involving node 4 are <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <4, (7, 12, 3)>, <4, (12, 3, 14)>, <4, (3, 14, 9)>.

For node 14:
- The neighbors of node 14 are 9, 4, 6, 11, 10.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 14.
- Unique 3-stars involving node 14 are <14, (9, 6, 4)>, <14, (6, 4, 11)>, <14, (4, 11, 10)>, <14, (11, 10, 9)>.

For node 12:
- The neighbors of node 12 are 4, 0, 3, 8.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 12.
- Unique 3-stars involving node 12 are <12, (4, 0, 3)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [46].
