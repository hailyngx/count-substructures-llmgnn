Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 

- Node 4 has neighbors: {9, 13, 5, 6}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {12, 11, 14, 8, 13}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 0, 12, 8}
- Node 11 has neighbors: {7, 10, 0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 12 has neighbors: {7, 1, 3}
- Node 10 has neighbors: {11, 9, 5, 14}
- Node 14 has neighbors: {7, 1, 10, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 10, 2, 0, 14}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 73

Thus, the final answer is [73] and the unique 3-stars found are:
