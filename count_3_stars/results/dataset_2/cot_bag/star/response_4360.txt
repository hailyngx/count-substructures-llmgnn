Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (22, 17) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 20) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 25) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 27) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 26) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 12) (17, 22) (17, 28) (20, 9) (20, 28) (15, 1) (15, 23) (23, 18) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 27) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 24) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 25) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 27) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 7) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 23) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 27) (27, 5) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For each of these nodes, we will find the number of 3-stars that can be formed.
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \).

For node 0, there are no 3-stars.
For node 1, there are no 3-stars.
For node 3, there are no 3-stars.
For node 5, there is 1 3-star. 
For node 6, there is 1 3-star. 
For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 10, there is 1 3-star.
For node 11, there are 1 3-star. 
For node 14, there is 1 3-star.
For node 18, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 19, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 21, there are no 3-stars.
For node 23, there are 1 3-star.
For node 24, there are 1 3-star. 
For node 26, there are 1 3-star.
For node 27, there is 1 3-star.
For node 28, there is 1 3-star.
For node 29, there is 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars:
\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 14>
<8, 9, 19>

<18, 19, 25>

<18, 19, 23>
<18, 25, 26>
<19, 23, 25>
<23, 24, 29>
<1, 3, 21>
