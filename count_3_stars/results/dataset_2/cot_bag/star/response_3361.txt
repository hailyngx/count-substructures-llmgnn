Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 18) (14, 20) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 15) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 7) (29, 5) (29, 11) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 14) (18, 19) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (3, 22) (3, 10) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 4) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (25, 0) (25, 11) (27, 17) (27, 5) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (12, 2) (12, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 24) (16, 0) (16, 13) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 13) (28, 20) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 24) (11, 29) (11, 9) (11, 25) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: Neighbors {17, 6, 25, 16, 24}
- Node 1: Neighbors {15, 10, 8, 24}
- Node 2: Neighbors {12, 26, 10, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {26, 21, 9, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {29, 23, 6, 27}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 26, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {29, 9, 25}
- Node 14: Neighbors {22, 18, 20}
- Node 15: Neighbors {17, 1, 6}
- Node 19: Neighbors {17, 22, 18, 21}
- Node 20: Neighbors {14, 21, 28}
- Node 22: Neighbors {14, 23, 19, 3}
- Node 24: Neighbors {1, 0, 13}
- Node 26: Neighbors {2, 10, 4}
- Node 27: Neighbors {17, 5}
- Node 29: Neighbors {5, 11}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
15. Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
16. Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].
