Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 3, 7, 2
- Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5, 3, 7, 8, 0
- Node 3: 7, 0, 2
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 0
- Node 6: 9, 0
- Node 7: 3, 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 9, 1, 4, 7, 2
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].
