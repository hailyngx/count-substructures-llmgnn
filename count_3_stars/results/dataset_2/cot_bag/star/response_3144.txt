Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will now calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Examining the degrees of the nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars each node contributes:
- Node 1, 3, and 2 each contribute 1 3-star.
- Nodes 10, 8, 4, 5, and 12 each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 11, 13, 0, and 14 each contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 9, 7, and 6 do not contribute to any 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars by summing up the contributions:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + (5 \times 10) + (4 \times 4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 50 + 16 = 69 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 14)>
<2, (11, 8, 6)>
<10, (1, 11, 8)>
<11, (1, 10, 7)>
<8, (10, 13, 4)>
<13, (8, 5, 14)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<5, (13, 4, 12)>
<12, (10, 4, 14)>
<0, (3, 4, 14)>
<14, (3, 13, 0)>
