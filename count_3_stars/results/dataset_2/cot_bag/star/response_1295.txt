Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 52

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
