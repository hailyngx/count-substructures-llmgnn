Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9, 11, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 10, and 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 10, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3 and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 12, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 11, and 13.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating the 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 72 \)

So, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in the given graph.
These 3-stars are: <1, (4, 9, 5)>, <1, (4, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (1, 9, 5)>, <4, (1, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 10, 6)>, <5, (8, 10, 13)>, <6, (1, 10, 8)>, <6, (11, 10, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 14)>, <7, (1, 0, 6)>, <7, (1, 0, 14)>, <7, (2, 6, 14)>, 
<7, (2, 13, 14)>, <7, (6, 0, 1)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 11, 14)>, <7, (6, 11, 2)>, <7, (6, 2, 14)>, <7, (6, 2, 13)>, <7, (10, 6, 11)>, <7, (10, 6, 2)>, <7, (11, 6, 14)>, <7, (11, 2, 14)>, 
<7, (14, 0, 1)>, <7, (14, 0, 2)>, <7, (14, 2, 6)>, <7, (14, 2, 13)>, <8, (5, 10, 13)>, <8, (5, 4, 9)>, <8, (10, 11, 6)>, <11, (4, 14, 9)>, <11, (6, 14, 8)>, <14, (4, 7, 11)>, <14, (4, 7, 13)>, <14, (7, 11, 4)>, <14, (7, 13, 4)>, <14, (13, 2, 7)>.
