Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors).
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 46 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
