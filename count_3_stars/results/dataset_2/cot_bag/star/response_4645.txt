Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 15) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 19) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 5, 0, 17, 10, 18
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 13, 5, 14, 10
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 19, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 8, 5, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 13, 16, 11
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 2, 17, 19, 9
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 16, 18, 15
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 3, 14, 9
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 6, 0, 12, 14
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 12
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 5, 11, 4

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). There is only 1 3-star if a node has exactly 3 neighbors. 

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
