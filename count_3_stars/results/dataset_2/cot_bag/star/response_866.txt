Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
After examining the graph, we find that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes and then sum them up:

- Node 0: 4C3 = 4
- Node 1: 4C3 = 4
- Node 2: 4C3 = 4
- Node 3: 4C3 = 4
- Node 4: 4C3 = 4
- Node 5: 4C3 = 4
- Node 6: 3C3 = 1
- Node 10: 3C3 = 1
- Node 11: 3C3 = 1
- Node 12: 3C3 = 1
- Node 13: 2C3 = 0
- Node 14: 4C3 = 4
- Node 15: 4C3 = 4
- Node 17: 3C3 = 1
- Node 19: 4C3 = 4

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35

Thus, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 17>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 17>
<1, 12, 17>
<2, 5, 16>
<3, 9, 17>
<3, 17, 19>
<4, 8, 11>
<6, 7, 14>
<10, 15, 19>
<11, 14, 18>
<12, 1, 17>
<14, 5, 18>
<15, 10, 19>
<15, 13, 0>
