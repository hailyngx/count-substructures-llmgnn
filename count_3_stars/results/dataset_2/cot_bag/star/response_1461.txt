Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 4) (27, 18) (27, 9) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 26) (9, 27) (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 17) (26, 7) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 8) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 23) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (3, 23) (21, 4) (21, 22) (13, 16) (13, 17) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 23) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 23) (2, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 29) (29, 11) (29, 10) (29, 25) (8, 26) (8, 10) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 10) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (18, 27) (18, 7) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 20) (19, 28) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 24) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph. Let's find the total number of 3-stars formed:

Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding all these up: 

\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44 \]

So, there are 44 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets: [44]

Now listing the unique 3-stars:

<11, (5, 17, 25)>
<16, (1, 13, 12)>
<15, (4, 22, 24)>
<9, (17, 26, 28)>
<26, (7, 5, 8)>
<20, (0, 19, 23)>
<17, (9, 11, 13)>
<24, (6, 15, 23)>
<10, (1, 14, 29)>
<29, (10, 11, 25)>
<22, (15, 25, 28)>
