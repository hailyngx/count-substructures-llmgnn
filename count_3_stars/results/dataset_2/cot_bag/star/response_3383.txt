Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) (19, 15) (19, 0) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 19) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 19) (3, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph described, we will first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: Neighbors 11, 7, 2, 13
- Node 4: Neighbors 6, 7, 14
- Node 5: Neighbors 11, 16, 8, 10
- Node 6: Neighbors 9, 17, 18, 4, 0
- Node 7: Neighbors 4, 12, 1, 10
- Node 8: Neighbors 9, 2, 5
- Node 10: Neighbors 9, 7, 3, 5
- Node 11: Neighbors 16, 1, 5
- Node 14: Neighbors 4, 12, 13
- Node 15: Neighbors 17, 2, 18, 19
- Node 16: Neighbors 11, 5
- Node 17: Neighbors 6, 15, 0
- Node 18: Neighbors 6, 15
- Node 19: Neighbors 15, 0

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 22 \). Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <6, (9, 17, 18)>
- <15, (17, 2, 18)>
