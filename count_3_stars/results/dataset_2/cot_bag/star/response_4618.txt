Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 22) (21, 20) (21, 29) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 22) (23, 26) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 24) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 18) (3, 7) (3, 22) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 25) (26, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 25) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 27) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 24) (18, 20) (18, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 22) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 28) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (19, 14) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 24) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 24) (24, 17) (24, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 28) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 28) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 6) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 3 + 3 \) gives us a total of 67 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [67], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (8, 13, 22)>, <4, (5, 16, 19)>, <5, (4, 13, 15)>, <6, (14, 27, 28)>, <7, (3, 9, 14)>, <8, (2, 11, 22)>, <9, (7, 12, 14)>, <10, (6, 18, 27)>, <11, (0, 2, 25)>, <12, (9, 13, 22)>, <13, (2, 5, 15)>, <14, (6, 7, 19)>, <15, (5, 13, 6)>, <20, (17, 18, 21)>, <22, (1, 8, 12)>, <24, (14, 10, 29)>, <26, (6, 23, 25)>, <27, (10, 6, 28)>, <28, (25, 24, 27)>
