Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the provided information:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8), (1, 2), (3, 6), (2, 8), (8, 6), (0, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, 7. <5, (9, 3, 7)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 2. <9, (5, 4, 2)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, 1. <4, (9, 7, 1)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 0. <7, (4, 5, 0)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, 2. <1, (9, 4, 2)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 6. <3, (5, 4, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, 8. <2, (9, 1, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, 6. <8, (7, 2, 6)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, 4. <0, (7, 6, 4)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, 8. <6, (4, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [9].
