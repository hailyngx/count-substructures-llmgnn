Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 27) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 16) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 23) (24, 8) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 29) (19, 29) (19, 23) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 19) (1, 25) (1, 28) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 28) (25, 1) (25, 12) (29, 15) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 19) (16, 27) (16, 8) (18, 12) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 13) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (11, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 23, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

So, the final answer is: [56]
