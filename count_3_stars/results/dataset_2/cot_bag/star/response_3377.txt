Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (21, 7) (21, 17) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 3) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (7, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 27) (6, 28) (6, 19) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 18) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (3, 5) (25, 5) (25, 22) (25, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 17) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 14) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (29, 16) (29, 24) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 10) (27, 23) (27, 8) (27, 18) (27, 13) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 10) (14, 25) (14, 20) (14, 15) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 1, 5, 9, 17, 22, 26, 28. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 28

Thus, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 13, 17)>, <5, (3, 20, 24)>, <5, (9, 8, 10)>, <5, (9, 10, 3)>, <5, (20, 14, 25)>, <5, (9, 10, 18)>, <5, (9, 10, 12)>, <5, (9, 8, 26)>, <5, (20, 8, 26)>, <5, (3, 9, 10)>, <9, (8, 10, 18)>, <17, (2, 21, 1)>, <22, (15, 23, 25)>, <22, (15, 14, 25)>, <22, (23, 27, 15)>, <22, (15, 23, 27)>, <26, (2, 8, 17)>, <28, (0, 4, 6)>, <28, (0, 4, 18)>, <28, (6, 19, 12)>, <28, (6, 4, 18)>, <28, (6, 4, 0)>, <28, (6, 19, 26)>, <28, (6, 4, 19)>, <28, (6, 19, 28)>, <28, (6, 28, 0)>, <28, (6, 19, 18)>, <28, (6, 19, 4)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 28.
