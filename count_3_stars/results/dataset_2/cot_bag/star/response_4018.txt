Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 15) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 14) (13, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 4) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node for easier reference:

- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 9, 12, 14, 19
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 10, 15, 16
- Node 5: 3, 11, 17
- Node 6: 12
- Node 7: 0, 9, 16, 18, 19
- Node 8: 2, 15, 18
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 11, 18
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 5, 9
- Node 12: 1, 6, 13, 17, 19
- Node 13: 12, 14, 18
- Node 14: 1, 13
- Node 15: 4, 8, 17
- Node 16: 4, 7, 17
- Node 17: 5, 12, 15, 16
- Node 18: 7, 8, 9, 13
- Node 19: 1, 7, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 0 3-stars
- Node 15: 0 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 16)>
<1, (9, 12, 19)>
<4, (10, 15, 16)>
<5, (3, 11, 17)>
<7, (0, 9, 18)>
<8, (2, 15, 18)>
<9, (1, 7, 11)>
<11, (5, 9, 17)>
<12, (1, 6, 13)>
<16, (4, 7, 17)>
<17, (5, 12, 15)>
<18, (7, 9, 13)>
<19, (1, 7, 12)>
