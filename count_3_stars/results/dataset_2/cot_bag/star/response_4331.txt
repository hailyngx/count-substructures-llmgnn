Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 14) (2, 15) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 15) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 18) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (11, 8) (11, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 10, 6, 0, 16, 3, 14, 12, 13, 18, 1, 19, 15.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
