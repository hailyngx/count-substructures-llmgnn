Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
1: 4, 8, 11, 2
2: 8, 0, 14, 5, 1
3: 6, 4, 7, 11, 14
4: 9, 8, 1, 3
5: 6, 10, 12, 0, 2
6: 5, 14, 7, 3
7: 6, 12, 3
8: 2, 4, 1
9: 4, 10, 13, 12
10: 9, 13, 5
11: 13, 3, 1
12: 9, 7, 5, 14
13: 9, 11, 10, 0
14: 6, 12, 0, 3, 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
1: [1]
2: [1]
3: [1]
4: [1]
5: [1]
6: [1]
7: [1]
8: [1]
9: [1]
10: [1]
11: [1]
12: [1]
13: [1]
14: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (8, 0, 14)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (6, 10, 12)>
<6, (5, 14, 7)>
<7, (6, 12, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (9, 10, 13)>
<10, (11, 13, 3)>
<11, (13, 10, 9)>
<12, (9, 12, 7)>
<13, (11, 3, 1)>
<14, (14, 6, 7)>
