Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (18, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 0) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 11) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 9) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (5, 16) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
There are some nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph:
- Node 4: neighbors are 7, 18, 13, 3, 15
- Node 7: neighbors are 4, 6, 17
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 17, 2, 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 4, 1, 8
- Node 15: neighbors are 4, 10, 11
- Node 13: neighbors are 4, 17, 0
- Node 11: neighbors are 15, 14, 19, 2
- Node 16: neighbors are 10, 12, 9, 5
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 11, 19, 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 10, 12, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we have 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:

<4, (7, 3, 15)>
<4, (18, 17, 13)>

<4, (1, 17, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 17)>
<1, (3, 17, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<15, (4, 10, 11)>
<13, (4, 17, 0)>
<11, (15, 14, 19)>
<11, (15, 14, 2)>
<11, (15, 19, 2)>
<11, (15, 11, 19)>
<16, (10, 12, 9)>
<16, (10, 12, 5)>
<16, (10, 9, 5)>
