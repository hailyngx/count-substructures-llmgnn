Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14 have three or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (10, 13, 14)>, <0, (10, 2, 14)>, <0, (13, 2, 14)>, <0, (10, 13, 2)>

For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<1, (4, 10, 12)>, <1, (4, 10, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (4, 2, 14)>, 
<1, (10, 2, 12)>, <1, (10, 2, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 2)>, <1, (10, 12, 2)>, <1, (12, 2, 14)>

For Node 2: 1 3-star
<2, (5, 8, 0)>

For Node 4: 2 3-stars
<4, (1, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 10, 1)>

For Node 6: 2 3-stars
<6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 13, 3)>

For Node 7: 1 3-star
<7, (4, 6, 10)>

For Node 8: 1 3-star
<8, (2, 14, 6)>

For Node 10: 2 3-stars
<10, (1, 4, 12)>, <10, (0, 12, 14)>

For Node 12: 2 3-stars
<12, (1, 4, 10)>, <12, (1, 8, 14)>

For Node 13: 2 3-stars
<13, (0, 6, 3)>, <13, (7, 8, 3)>

For Node 14: 2 3-stars
<14, (0, 8, 10)>, <14, (1, 8, 0)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 27 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 27, which can be represented as [27].
