Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 23) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 20) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 22) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 2) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 10) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 10) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (23, 16) (10, 6) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 16) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 2) (13, 25) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 1) (25, 13) (24, 9) (24, 0) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 27) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 18) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) 

Response:
There are 21 nodes with degree 3 or more:

- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 5
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 23 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 4

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center. We will then sum up the total number of 3-stars formed.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
