Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 6, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 12, 0, 14, 2, 8, 11, 5, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: $4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 92$.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is equal to 92.

List of unique 3-stars found: 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 12)>, <4, (2, 3, 13)>, <7, (5, 0, 12)>, <1, (3, 0, 10)>, <3, (1, 5, 12)>, <12, (5, 0, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <14, (7, 13, 10)>.
