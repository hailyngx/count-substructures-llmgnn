Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 27) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 0) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 17) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (25, 10) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 19) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 27) (21, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 14) (6, 19) (17, 18) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (15, 16) (15, 24) (15, 7) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 21) (29, 0) (28, 5) (28, 14) (28, 4) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 14) (4, 28) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 6) (12, 23) (12, 26) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Looking at each node, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 20, 22)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 9, 19)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (10, 11, 23, 25)
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (8, 21, 25)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 28)
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (11, 15, 18)
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (5, 16, 17, 26)
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 27)
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors (4, 10, 22, 23, 27)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors (8, 12, 21, 27)
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (12, 13, 18, 26)
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors (7, 20, 21, 27)
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 14)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34 \]

So, there are a total of 34 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [34].
