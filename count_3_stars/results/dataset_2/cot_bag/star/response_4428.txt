- Node 3: 8, 15, 16, 18, 21
- Node 4: 1, 17, 19
- Node 5: 8, 18, 22, 23
- Node 6: 0, 22, 24
- Node 7: 12, 15
- Node 8: 2, 3, 16, 23
- Node 9: 11, 24
- Node 10: 2, 14, 28
- Node 11: 9, 23
- Node 12: 7, 20, 28, 29
- Node 13: 0, 26
- Node 14: 10
- Node 15: 3, 7, 24, 25
- Node 16: 3, 8, 21, 26
- Node 17: 0, 2, 4, 29
- Node 18: 3, 5, 20, 29
- Node 19: 4, 25
- Node 20: 12, 18
- Node 21: 3, 16
- Node 22: 5, 6, 25
- Node 23: 5, 8, 11, 26
- Node 24: 6, 9, 15
- Node 25: 15, 19, 22, 27
- Node 26: 1, 13, 16, 21
- Node 27: 0, 25
- Node 28: 10, 12
- Node 29: 0, 12, 17, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <3, (8, 15, 16)>, <3, (8, 15, 18)>, <3, (8, 15, 21)>, <3, (8, 16, 21)>, <3, (15, 24, 25)>, <15, (3, 7, 25)>, <15, (3, 24, 25)>, <15, (7, 12, 25)>, <0, (6, 22, 27)>, <0, (13, 26, 29)>, <0, (17, 27, 29)>, <8, (2, 5, 23)>, <8, (2, 10, 23)>, <8, (5, 22, 23)>, <16, (3, 8, 26)>, <16, (3, 21, 26)>, <16, (8, 21, 26)>, <16, (21, 26, 29)>, <18, (5, 20, 29)>, <18, (20, 29, 29)>, <26, (1, 13, 26)>
