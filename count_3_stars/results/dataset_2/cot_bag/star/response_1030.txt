Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 17) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 10)>, <4, (0, 7, 11)>, <7, (4, 10, 9)>, <7, (5, 10, 14)>, <10, (0, 7, 14)>, <10, (8, 7, 0)>, <11, (4, 15, 9)>, <12, (17, 13, 14)>, <15, (1, 19, 5)>, <15, (5, 11, 19)>, <15, (5, 19, 1)>, <15, (19, 1, 6)>, <17, (12, 16, 19)>, <17, (16, 2, 19)>, <17, (2, 16, 17)>, <17, (19, 12, 2)>, <19, (17, 15, 6)>, <19, (6, 1, 15)>, <19, (15, 5, 19)>, <19, (6, 15, 17)>, <19, (15, 17, 19)>, <19, (6, 17, 15)>
