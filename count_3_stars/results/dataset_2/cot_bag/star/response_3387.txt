Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (14, 12) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors, which can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 11, 12, 13, 3, 6 (total: 5)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 9, 11, 7, 2 (total: 5)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 8, 1, 3 (total: 4)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 7, 12, 2, 0, 6 (total: 5)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 10 (total: 2)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 10, 12, 13, 3, 0 (total: 5)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 10, 11, 12, 2 (total: 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 7, 13 (total: 3)
- Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 6, 4, 8 (total: 4)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 7, 14, 0, 6, 3, 8 (total: 6)
- Node 13 has neighbors: 5, 9, 0, 6 (total: 4)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{2}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 67 \]

Therefore, there are 67 3-stars in this graph.

In <>: <0, (11, 2, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <3, (7, 12, 6)>, <8, (10, 11, 12)>, <12, (7, 14, 6)>
