Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can visualize the connections to determine the 3-stars.

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 forms \(\binom{5}{3}\) 3-stars = 10 3-stars

For Node 2:
- Node 2 forms \(\binom{6}{3}\) 3-stars = 20 3-stars

For Node 3:
- Node 3 forms \(\binom{5}{3}\) 3-stars = 10 3-stars

For Node 4:
- Node 4 forms \(\binom{4}{3}\) 3-stars = 4 3-stars

For Node 7:
- Node 7 forms \(\binom{4}{3}\) 3-stars = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 2, 9)>
- <1, (4, 3, 7)>
- <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 3)>
