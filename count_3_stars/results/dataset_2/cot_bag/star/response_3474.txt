Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 15) (29, 4) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 22) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 27) (13, 18) (0, 27) (27, 11) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 20) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 10) (28, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 3) (26, 22) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 25) (1, 24) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 18) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (25, 7) (25, 24) (25, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 15) (19, 8) (19, 28) (19, 23) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (17, 18) (12, 14) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 3) (20, 9) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 22) (3, 20) (3, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 29) (4, 21) (6, 25) (6, 3) (23, 1) (23, 19) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 66 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars inside [] is 66.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 14, 23)>, <7, (3, 9, 22)>, <8, (10, 19, 28)>, <13, (0, 14, 27)>, <15, (1, 10, 18)>, <16, (2, 5, 29)>, <18, (1, 5, 17)>, <20, (3, 7, 27)>, <21, (4, 22, 28)>, <22, (3, 7, 26)>, <27, (11, 13, 20)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 66, and they are: <1, (4, 14, 23)>, <7, (3, 9, 22)>, <8, (10, 19, 28)>, <13, (0, 14, 27)>, <15, (1, 10, 18)>, <16, (2, 5, 29)>, <18, (1, 5, 17)>, <20, (3, 7, 27)>, <21, (4, 22, 28)>, and <22, (3, 7, 26)>.
