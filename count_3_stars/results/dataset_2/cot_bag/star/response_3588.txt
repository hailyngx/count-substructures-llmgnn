Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 8) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 16) (19, 12) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 15) (10, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. We can then calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22  
Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 4, 17>
- <4, 1, 14>
- <9, 3, 13>
- <10, 5, 16>
- <12, 13, 15>
