Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 6) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 13) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 9) (16, 3) (16, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 2) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges into a more readable format:

Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 15)
Node 1: (1, 13), (1, 17)
Node 2: (2, 13), (2, 9)
Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 16), (3, 19)
Node 4: (4, 18), (4, 14)
Node 5: (5, 15)
Node 6: (6, 8), (6, 17), (6, 18), (6, 16)
Node 7: (7, 8), (7, 0)
Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 19), (8, 6), (8, 12), (8, 7)
Node 9: (9, 14), (9, 2)
Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 15)
Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 19), (11, 18), (11, 15)
Node 12: (12, 8), (12, 14)
Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 1), (13, 19)
Node 14: (14, 4), (14, 3), (14, 12), (14, 9)
Node 15: (15, 10), (15, 11), (15, 18), (15, 0), (15, 5)
Node 16: (16, 3), (16, 6)
Node 17: (17, 1), (17, 6)
Node 18: (18, 11), (18, 4), (18, 15), (18, 6)
Node 19: (19, 8), (19, 13), (19, 11), (19, 3)

Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 54

Thus, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Next, we can list out the unique 3-stars:

<3, (11, 14, 16)>, <6, (8, 17, 18)>, <8, (13, 19, 12)>, <11, (10, 18, 15)>, <13, (8, 2, 1)>, <14, (4, 3, 9)>, <15, (10, 11, 18)>, <18, (11, 4, 6)>, <19, (8, 13, 11)>
