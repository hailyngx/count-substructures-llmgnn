Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following 3-stars:
- [(node 5)]: <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <5, (3, 4, 1)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 0)>
- [(node 4)]: <4, (9, 8, 7)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- [(node 3)]: <3, (5, 4, 1)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>, <3, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (4, 8, 1)>
- [(node 8)]: <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (7, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 8, 1)>, <8, (4, 8, 1)>
- [(node 0)]: <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [23].
