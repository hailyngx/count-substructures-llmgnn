Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 2, 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (1, 3, 2)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 2)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 2)>, 
<0, (9, 8, 5)>, 
<8, (7, 3, 6)>, 
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
