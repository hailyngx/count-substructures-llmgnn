Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 15) (18, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 17) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 16) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (16, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 16) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (11, 9, 5, 12), so it can form 4 3-stars.
2. Node 15: Has 3 neighbors (18, 8, 2), so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 14: Has 3 neighbors (17, 6, 10), so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 17: Has 3 neighbors (14, 1, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 7: Has 3 neighbors (12, 5, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 12: Has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 13), so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 18: Has 2 neighbors (15, 4), so it cannot form any 3-star.
8. Node 11: Has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 2), so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (17, 7, 13, 19), so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 13: Has 3 neighbors (12, 1, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (15, 19, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 19: Has 4 neighbors (1, 8, 10, 16), so it can form 4 3-stars.
13. Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (3, 13, 16), so it can form 1 3-star.
14. Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 11, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.
15. Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (14, 4, 10), so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 10: Has 4 neighbors (14, 19, 6, 16), so it can form 4 3-stars.
17. Node 2: Has 2 neighbors (15, 11), so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
