Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
