Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 12) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (17, 18) (17, 9) (17, 8) (12, 2) (12, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 18, 0, 14, 2, 19, 15, 13, 17, 12, 7, 9, 10, 8, 16.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of, and then sum them up.

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them all up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (1, 7, 18)>, <6, (10, 16, 11)>, <4, (18, 15, 16)>, <18, (4, 17, 8)>, <14, (0, 9, 16)>, <9, (14, 19, 15)>, <17, (18, 9, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 13)>, <10, (6, 19, 7)>, <15, (1, 4, 11)>.
