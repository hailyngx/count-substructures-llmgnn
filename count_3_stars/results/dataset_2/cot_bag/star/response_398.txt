Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 15) (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (8, 16) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 24) (15, 22) (15, 20) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (26, 25) (26, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 2) (17, 9) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 14) (14, 22) (14, 29) (14, 2) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 27) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 26) (0, 28) (0, 19) (0, 12) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 0) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 10) (24, 13) (24, 23) (24, 19) (24, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 8, 5, 23, 10
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 14, 19, 28
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 25, 23
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 27, 22, 1, 29
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 16, 23, 10, 1
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 13, 6, 17, 27
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 24
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 22, 24, 9
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 22, 29, 2
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 7, 20, 6, 8
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 24, 2, 21, 0
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 16, 15, 29
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 13, 14, 15, 5
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 13, 23, 19, 10
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 18
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 12
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 20, 5, 14, 8

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3}] \]

Calculating these values:
\[ [0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 56 + 84 + 120 + 286 + 28 + 560 + 969 + 1140 + 1540 + 2024 + 35 + 3276 + 2030] \]
\[ = [11409] \]

Therefore, there are 11,409 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
