Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 11, 4, 14.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 8, 10, 13, 12.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 14, 12, 8.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 2, 10.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 11, 7, 4, 13.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 4.
Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 5, 3.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3, 10, 12, 0, 8.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 7, 13, 0.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 8, 14.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 7, 2.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 7, 12, 2.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 12, 14.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 10, 14.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 13, 4.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} ] = [ 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 ] = [ 57 ] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 57.
Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (2, 4, 14)>
<9, (8, 10, 13)>
<6, (8, 12, 14)>
<1, (2, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<3, (4, 10, 13)>
<7, (0, 8, 12)>
<7, (3, 8, 10)>
<12, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 13)>
<14, (2, 6, 13)>
<14, (4, 5, 13)>
