Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these numbers up, we get a total of 74 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [74]. 

Now we list the unique 3-stars found:
