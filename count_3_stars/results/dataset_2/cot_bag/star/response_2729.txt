Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
