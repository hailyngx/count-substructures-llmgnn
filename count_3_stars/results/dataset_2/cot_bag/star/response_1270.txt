Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Checking each node, we see the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 

Adding these up: 
\( [ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 ] = [ 52 ] \)

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
