Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars. 

There are several nodes with more than 3 neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (7, 10, 16)>, <1, (10, 16, 21)>, <1, (1, 16, 27)>, <1, (16, 21, 27)>, <1, (1, 10, 21)>, 
<3, (7, 12, 16)>, 
<5, (13, 15, 19)>, <5, (15, 19, 25)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<10, (4, 6, 10)>, 
<11, (10, 11, 29)>, 
<13, (5, 13, 19)>, 
<15, (4, 15, 19)>, <15, (5, 15, 19)>, 
<16, (1, 3, 16)>, 
<19, (15, 19, 25)>, <19, (19, 24, 25)>, <19, (13, 19, 25)>, 
<24, (19, 24, 25)>, 
<26, (18, 26, 29)>, 
<28, (0, 24, 28)>.
