Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 9, 1, 4, 8, 7
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <2, (9, 1, 8)>)

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 5, 3, 8, 2
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <4, (5, 3, 8)>)

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 9, 8, 4, 0, 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <5, (9, 8, 4)>)

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 2
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <7, (9, 6, 8)>)

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 5, 1, 4, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <8, (5, 1, 4)>)

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 7, 0
- Number of 3-stars: 1 (3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 2)>)

There are no additional 3-stars formed by nodes 1, 3, 6. So the total number of 3-stars is [7].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (9, 1, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (9, 8, 4)>, 
<7, (9, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (5, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 2)>.
