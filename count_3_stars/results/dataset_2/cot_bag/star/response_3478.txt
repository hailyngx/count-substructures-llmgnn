Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 9) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 8) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 2) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (9, 0) (9, 4) (6, 17) (6, 18) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 15) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 12, and 18.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For node 0, there are 2 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 2, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 3, there are 3 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 12, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 18, there are 4 choices for the three neighbors out of 4 total neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars for each node gives a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24\).  
So, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (12, 16, 9)>
<2, (3, 16, 13)>
<3, (2, 16, 11)>
<4, (1, 13, 9)>
<12, (0, 16, 13)>
<18, (3, 6, 7)>
