Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 24) (5, 28) (5, 14) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 7) (29, 17) (29, 18) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 5) (24, 11) (24, 22) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 13) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 28) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 16) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (25, 11) (25, 8) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 23) (14, 13) (14, 4) (6, 26) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 22) (22, 1) (22, 24) (22, 6) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 12) (2, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 3, 10, 17, 26, 29, 0, 7, 21, 18, 11, 24, 15, 19, 12, 20, 8, 23, 13, 25, 27, 14, 6, 22, 28, 4, and 16.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.

Thus, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, 24, 14>
<9, 17, 13>
<1, 26, 28>
<3, 9, 26>
<10, 17, 7>
<17, 29, 18>
<26, 7, 3>
<29, 17, 11>
<0, 7, 21>
<18, 29, 20>
<11, 24, 25>
<24, 5, 22>
<15, 19, 13>
<19, 21, 15>
<12, 21, 20>
<20, 18, 27>
<8, 25, 27>
<23, 17, 14>
<13, 9, 19>
<25, 8, 11>
<27, 20, 6>
<14, 5, 23>
<6, 26, 3>
<22, 1, 24>
<28, 5, 1>
<4, 14, 2>
