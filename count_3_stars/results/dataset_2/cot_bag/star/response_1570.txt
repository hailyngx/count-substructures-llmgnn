Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 10) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (11, 0) (11, 15) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38 \)

Therefore, there are 38 3-stars. Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 16>
<1, 4, 16>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 9, 16>
<4, 16, 8>
<4, 16, 17>
<8, 5, 12>
<8, 13, 19>
<8, 13, 7>
<8, 13, 3>
<9, 0, 11>
<9, 0, 17>
<10, 6, 2>
<10, 6, 3>
<10, 6, 15>
<10, 3, 9>
<10, 3, 18>
<13, 3, 10>
<15, 12, 19>
<15, 14, 4>
<15, 14, 10>
<16, 1, 8>
<16, 1, 9>
<16, 1, 2>
<16, 1, 4>
<18, 3, 19>
<19, 12, 5> 

Putting the final number in brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [38].
