Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 18) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 14) (10, 9) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 29 3-stars. So, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 11, 17>
- <2, 14, 17>
- <2, 18, 3>
- <2, 13, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <4, 17, 7>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <5, 13, 2>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <6, 13, 12>
- <6, 4, 17>
- <6, 8, 15>
- <8, 0, 19>
- <8, 6, 4>
- <8, 15, 12>
- <10, 14, 4>
- <14, 17, 1>
- <14, 7, 5>
- <14, 2, 10>
- <17, 14, 7>
- <17, 1, 3>
- <17, 0, 19>
- <17, 4, 6>
- <18, 2, 13>
- <18, 3, 11>
- <18, 15, 8>
