Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them and then calculate the total number of 3-stars they form based on the given information.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 5
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 14, 5
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 11, 13, 7
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 13, 2, 8
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 14, 13, 12, 10, 2
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 13, 4, 12, 9
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 12, 5
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 11, 4, 10, 6, 9
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5, 10, 9, 7, 6
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 3, 0, 8, 9, 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node and add them up:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 73 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 73. 

Therefore, the answer is [73]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 11>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<10, 12, 13>
<11, 12, 14>
<12, 13, 14>
<13, 14, 9>
<1, 5, 11>
