Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 1, 3, 10, 11, 0, 14, 2, 8, 4, 12, 6, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing these up: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 94 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars are:
