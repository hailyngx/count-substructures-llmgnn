Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (6, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 92 \)

So, there are 92 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:

<1, (5, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 12)>
<9, (2, 13, 11)>
<10, (1, 3, 14)>
<12, (1, 8, 7)>
<13, (9, 2, 6)>
<14, (9, 1, 4)>
