Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 

Response:
There are 17 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19.   

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so there are 0 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so there are 0 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 10 = 46 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (4, 12, 19)>, 
<2, (7, 14, 16)>, 
<4, (1, 10, 12)>, 
<5, (0, 10, 19)>,  
<6, (7, 8, 13)>,  
<8, (14, 16, 19)>,  
<10, (4, 5, 16)>,  
<12, (1, 4, 19)>,
<13, (0, 6, 19)>,
<14, (0, 2, 8)>,
<16, (2, 10, 14)>,
<19, (0, 5, 12)>.
