Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 15) (27, 11) (15, 9) (15, 27) (15, 23) (8, 22) (8, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 25) (17, 22) (17, 3) (29, 1) (29, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 21) (18, 3) (16, 13) (28, 18) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 11) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 29) (3, 17) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (14, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 19) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 20) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 25) (24, 10) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 6) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 5, 6, 26, 27}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 10, 29}
- Node 3: neighbors {14, 17, 18, 29}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 9, 18}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 11, 12, 19}
- Node 7: neighbors {9, 20, 23}
- Node 8: neighbors {21, 22}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 7, 15, 26}
- Node 11: neighbors {6, 21, 22, 27}
- Node 15: neighbors {9, 15, 23, 27}
- Node 18: neighbors {3, 4, 21, 28}
- Node 19: neighbors {2, 6, 13, 25}
- Node 21: neighbors {8, 10, 11, 18}
- Node 22: neighbors {8, 11, 17, 25, 26}
- Node 25: neighbors {10, 19, 22, 26}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 26)>, <0, (2, 6, 19)>, <0, (2, 5, 26)>, <0, (2, 5, 27)>, <1, (9, 10, 29)>, <3, (14, 17, 18)>, <4, (5, 9, 18)>, <6, (11, 19, 6)>, <7, (20, 7, 23)>, <9, (1, 15, 9)>, <11, (6, 21, 11)>, <15, (23, 15, 27)>, <18, (3, 21, 18)>, <19, (2, 6, 19)>, <21, (8, 11, 21)>, <22, (8, 25, 22)>, <25, (10, 25, 25)>.
