Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 0, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, and Node 13.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes based on their degrees.

- Node 0: Degree = 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: Degree = 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: Degree = 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: Degree = 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12: Degree = 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: Degree = 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 84 3-stars.

Putting it all together:

[84]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 12, 10)>
<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<7, (5, 10, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<12, (5, 9, 0)>
<13, (5, 9, 6)>
<13, (5, 9, 11)>
<13, (6, 11, 14)>
<13, (12, 11, 14)>
