Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 7) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 14, 17, 6, 9, 7, 12, 5, 19, 8, 0, 15, 4, 13, 2.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by summing up the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 37 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [37]. The unique 3-stars found are <11, (16, 1, 0)>, <16, (11, 0, 14)>, <14, (16, 17, 4)>, <17, (14, 15, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 15)>, <7, (6, 18, 13)>, <12, (13, 15, 19)>, <5, (16, 19, 8)>, <19, (12, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 19, 0)>, <0, (11, 16, 8)>, <15, (17, 6, 12)>, <4, (17, 19, 1)>, <13, (11, 7, 12)>, <2, (9, 5, 10)>.
