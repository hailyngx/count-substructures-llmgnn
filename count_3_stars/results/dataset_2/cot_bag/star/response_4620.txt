Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs centered at each of these nodes:

Centered at node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Centered at node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Centered at node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 47 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 29)>
<4, (19, 24, 29)>
<5, (1, 14, 28)>
<7, (0, 10, 13)>
<10, (6, 12, 17)>
<13, (0, 7, 22)>
<14, (5, 16, 24)>
<15, (11, 23, 25)>
<17, (9, 10, 12)>
<19, (4, 12, 29)>
<21, (11, 16, 26)>
<22, (7, 13, 26)>
<23, (15, 27, 28)>
<24, (2, 4, 14)>
<25, (15, 27, 29)>
<26, (7, 21, 22)>
<27, (23, 25, 29)>
<28, (3, 5, 23)>
<29, (4, 18, 25)>
