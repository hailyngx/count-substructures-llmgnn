Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 6, 9, 10, 7, 12, 2, 8, 0, 14, 5, 13, and 1. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 77 \)

Therefore, there are 77 3-stars in this graph.  

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
