Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 13 can't form any 3-star
- Node 17 can't form any 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 0 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars formed: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (6, 15, 19)>
<6, (3, 11, 15)>
<11, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 13, 14)>
<4, (0, 8, 13)>
<0, (4, 7, 16)>
<19, (15, 18, 6)>
<2, (12, 14, 9)>
