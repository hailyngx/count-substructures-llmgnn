Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- From node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [50].
