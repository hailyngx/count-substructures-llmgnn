Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars. Thus, the final number to put inside brackets is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 5)>
- <0, (1, 6, 2)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 8, 5)>
- <1, (2, 6, 0)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (8, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 0)>
- <5, (0, 8, 3)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 2)>
- <5, (6, 1, 0)>
- <8, (1, 0, 5)>
