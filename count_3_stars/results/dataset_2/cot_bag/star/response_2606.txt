Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (0, 11) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (12, 6) (12, 19) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
This graph consists of a total of 20 nodes with 60 edges. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars based on the given nodes and edges. 
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- For 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 15, 16)>
<3, (7, 9, 17)>
<4, (1, 13, 15)>
<13, (4, 15, 19)>
<15, (1, 3, 9)>
