Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 3, 4, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 11, 19
- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 8, 9, 13
- Node 6 has neighbors 12, 15, 18
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 8, 14, 17
- Node 14 has neighbors 7, 9, 17
- Node 16 has neighbors 10, 11, 15, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <4, 11, 19>
- <5, 2, 8>
- <5, 2, 13>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <9, 8, 14>
- <9, 8, 17>
- <9, 14, 17>
- <14, 7, 9>
- <16, 10, 11>
- <16, 10, 15>
- <16, 15, 19>
- <16, 11, 19>
- <16, 15, 11>
