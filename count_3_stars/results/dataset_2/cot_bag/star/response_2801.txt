Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {5, 7, 3, 2}
- 1: {9, 4, 7, 6, 8}
- 2: {9, 8, 0}
- 3: {4, 0, 6}
- 4: {7, 8, 1, 3}
- 5: {9, 6, 0, 7}
- 6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
- 7: {5, 4, 0, 1}
- 8: {4, 1, 6, 2}
- 9: {5, 6, 2, 1}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10  3-stars
For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1  3-star
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1  3-star
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10  3-stars
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4  3-stars

Summing these up, we get:
4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 6)>, <1, (9, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 6)>, <5, (9, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
