Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (9, 8) (9, 18) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors including: 

- Node 11 with 4 neighbors: 16, 5, 6, 15
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors: 18, 13, 14
- Node 7 with 2 neighbors: 0, 10
- Node 8 with 5 neighbors: 13, 2, 9, 14, 3
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 19
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors: 7, 12, 5
- Node 17 with 3 neighbors: 2, 15
- Node 18 with 2 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors: 8, 17, 15, 0
- Node 5 with 3 neighbors: 11, 10, 19
- Node 0 with 3 neighbors: 7, 2, 6
- Node 19 with 5 neighbors: 13, 5, 15, 14, 12
- Node 9 with 2 neighbors: 8, 18
- Node 15 with 4 neighbors: 11, 17, 2, 19
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors: 11, 0, 1
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors: 10, 19, 3
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 14
- Node 14 with 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 19, 3

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Other nodes do not have enough neighbors to form 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29 \).

Thus, the final answer is [29] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<11, 5, 19>, <8, 2, 17>, <8, 2, 15>, <8, 2, 0>, <8, 9, 18>, <8, 13, 4>, <8, 13, 19>, <8, 14, 3>, <8, 14, 19>, <13, 4, 18>, <13, 4, 14>, <13, 8, 19>, <13, 19, 5>, <19, 5, 11>, <19, 5, 15>, <19, 5, 10>, <19, 5, 12>, <15, 11, 17>, <15, 11, 2>, <15, 17, 2>, <15, 17, 19>, <15, 2, 0>, <15, 2, 17>, <15, 17, 19>, <15, 19, 14>, <14, 4, 8>, <14, 4, 19>, <14, 8, 3>, <14, 8, 19>
