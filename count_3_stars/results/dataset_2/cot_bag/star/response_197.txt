Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 6) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 17.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, there are 46 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (11, 16, 18)>, <0, (11, 15, 18)>, <0, (11, 15, 0)>, <0, (16, 0, 18)>, <1, (11, 12, 13)>, <1, (11, 13, 
9)>, <1, (12, 7, 13)>, <1, (13, 7, 5)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 18)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (8, 4, 6)>, <5, (13, 7, 5)>, <7, (12, 1, 13)>, <7, (12, 1, 11)>, <7, (12, 1, 1)>, <7, (17, 9, 1)>, <8, (4, 6, 18)>, <11, (19, 17, 11)>, <13, (1, 7, 13)>, <13, (1, 9, 13)>, <13, (5, 7, 13)>, <14, (2, 3, 14)>, <14, (2, 5, 14)>, <14, (2, 7, 14)>, <15, (0, 11, 15)>, <18, (0, 6, 18)>, <18, (0, 8, 18)>, <18, (0, 15, 18)>, <18, (6, 8, 18)>, <19, (11, 17, 19)>
