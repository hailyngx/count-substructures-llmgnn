Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (2, 8) (2, 0) (29, 6) (29, 5) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 21) (23, 6) (23, 22) (23, 5) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 17) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 26) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 27) (7, 13) (26, 4) (26, 10) (26, 25) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 12) (28, 24) (10, 26) (10, 25) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 13) (25, 24) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 1) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 15) (1, 9) (1, 5) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 18) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 21) (18, 15) (24, 28) (24, 25) (15, 22) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 18) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the counts for all nodes, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 21, 28>
<4, 20, 27, 28>
<6, 8, 9, 19>
<8, 2, 15, 22>
<9, 1, 5, 19>
<12, 4, 15, 18>
<15, 8, 17, 22>
<19, 9, 13, 16>
<20, 0, 3, 4>
<21, 0, 18, 22>
<22, 15, 21, 23>
<25, 10, 13, 24>
<26, 10, 25, 27>
<27, 4, 7, 28>
<28, 12, 24, 25>
