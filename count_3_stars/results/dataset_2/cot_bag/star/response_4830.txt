Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 21) (18, 27) (18, 24) (22, 5) (22, 15) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 19) (20, 23) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 26) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (26, 25) (26, 8) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 19) (21, 29) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 12) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 28) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 9) (13, 2) (13, 21) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 1) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 9) (19, 6) (14, 20) (14, 23) (16, 9) (16, 27) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 27) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (24, 29) (24, 18) (27, 18) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 5) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 3) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms 2 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 38

Thus, there are 38 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have: [38]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 29, 24)>
<4, (2, 29, 6)>
<5, (22, 1, 27)>
<8, (19, 26, 12)>
<11, (17, 20, 28)>
<12, (8, 28, 3)>
<13, (2, 21, 29)>
<15, (22, 10, 1)>
<17, (0, 7, 11)>
<19, (0, 6, 9)>
<20, (14, 25, 11)>
<21, (13, 27, 29)>
<22, (3, 5, 15)>
<24, (18, 29, 27)>
<25, (20, 26, 11)>
<26, (8, 25, 12)>
<27, (5, 16, 21)>
<28, (11, 12, 21)>
<29, (4, 2, 21)>
