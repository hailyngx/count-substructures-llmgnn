Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are given in the input.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9, 0.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (1, 4, 6)> <5, (1, 4, 9)> <5, (1, 4, 0)> <5, (1, 6, 9)> <5, (1, 6, 0)> <5, (1, 9, 0)> <5, (4, 6, 9)> <5, (4, 6, 0)> <5, (4, 9, 0)> <5, (6, 9, 0)>

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <7, (1, 2, 3)> <7, (1, 2, 4)> <7, (1, 2, 6)> <7, (1, 3, 4)> <7, (1, 3, 6)> <7, (1, 4, 6)> <7, (2, 3, 4)> <7, (2, 3, 6)> <7, (2, 4, 6)> <7, (3, 4, 6)>

5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as center: 1
   <6, (1, 5, 7)>

6. Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   <2, (0, 1, 3)> <2, (0, 1, 7)> <2, (0, 1, 8)> <2, (0, 1, 9)> <2, (0, 3, 7)> <2, (0, 3, 8)> <2, (0, 3, 9)> <2, (0, 7, 8)> <2, (0, 7, 9)> <2, (0, 8, 9)> <2, (1, 3, 7)> <2, (1, 3, 8)> <2, (1, 3, 9)> <2, (1, 7, 8)> <2, (1, 7, 9)> <2, (1, 8, 9)> <2, (3, 7, 8)> <2, (3, 7, 9)> <2, (3, 8, 9)> <2, (7, 8, 9)>

7. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <1, (0, 2, 3)> <1, (0, 2, 5)> <1, (0, 2, 6)> <1, (0, 3, 5)> <1, (0, 3, 6)> <1, (0, 5, 6)> <1, (2, 3, 5)> <1, (2, 3, 6)> <1, (2, 5, 6)> <1, (3, 5, 6)>

8. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <3, (2, 4, 7)> <3, (2, 4, 9)> <3, (2, 7, 9)> <3, (4, 7, 9)>

9. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as center: 1
   <0, (1, 2, 5)>

There are a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 64 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64].
