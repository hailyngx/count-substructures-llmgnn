Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [54] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <5, 8, 0, 13>
- <5, 8, 9, 14>
- <4, 7, 1, 2>
- <4, 7, 13, 2>
- <4, 8, 7, 13>
- <4, 8, 7, 1>
- <4, 3, 1, 6>
- <7, 4, 8, 13>
- <7, 4, 13, 1>
- <7, 4, 13, 2>
- <1, 3, 6, 10>
- <3, 6, 4, 2>
- <3, 6, 4, 1>
- <1, 6, 4, 2>
- <14, 9, 7, 1>
- <14, 9, 7, 2>
- <14, 9, 1, 2>
- <14, 7, 1, 2>
- <14, 7, 1, 12>
