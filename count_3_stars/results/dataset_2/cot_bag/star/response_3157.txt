Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 7) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 20) (2, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 1) (29, 17) (29, 21) (22, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 29) (7, 9) (7, 6) (26, 28) (26, 18) (28, 9) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 20) (16, 4) (16, 19) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 23) (11, 20) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 23) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 19) (24, 14) (24, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 24) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  

Node 1 with neighbors {15, 17, 12, 23}  
Node 2 with neighbors {25, 8, 28}  
Node 3 with neighbors {25, 21, 6}  
Node 4 with neighbors {22, 16, 10, 23}  
Node 5 with neighbors {9, 6, 13}  
Node 6 with neighbors {3, 5, 21, 7, 20}  
Node 8 with neighbors {13, 2, 17}  
Node 9 with neighbors {5, 28, 14, 7}  
Node 10 with neighbors {15, 4, 19}  
Node 12 with neighbors {15, 1, 24}  
Node 13 with neighbors {5, 8, 0}  
Node 14 with neighbors {9, 0, 18, 24, 20}  
Node 15 with neighbors {10, 1, 12}  
Node 16 with neighbors {4, 19}  
Node 17 with neighbors {8, 1, 29}  
Node 18 with neighbors {14, 26, 23}  
Node 19 with neighbors {16, 10, 23}  
Node 20 with neighbors {6, 14, 28, 11}  
Node 21 with neighbors {3, 25, 6, 29}  
Node 23 with neighbors {1, 18, 4, 19}  
Node 24 with neighbors {14, 12}  
Node 25 with neighbors {3, 1, 21, 2}  
Node 28 with neighbors {9, 2, 26, 20}  
Node 29 with neighbors {17, 21}  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:  
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0] = [60] \]

Therefore, there are 60 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 15, 12>, <1, 15, 17>, <1, 15, 23>, <1, 17, 23>, <2, 25, 8>, <3, 25, 21>, <4, 10, 16>, <4, 10, 19>, <4, 16, 19>, <4, 22, 16>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 14>, <6, 20, 14>, <6, 7, 9>, <8, 13, 0>, <9, 14, 18>, <9, 14, 20>, <9, 14, 24>, <10, 15, 19>, <12, 15, 24>, <13, 0, 8>, <14, 18, 26>, <14, 20, 28>, <15, 10, 1>, <16, 19, 23>, <21, 3, 25>, <21, 25, 6>, <21, 25, 29>, <23, 1, 18>, <28, 20, 14>
