Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 36 3-stars. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars are <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>.
