Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each of these nodes: 
\( 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 67 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <7, (6, 5, 9)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>.
