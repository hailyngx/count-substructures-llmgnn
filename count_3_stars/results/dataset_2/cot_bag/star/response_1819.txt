Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 7) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 15, 16}
- Node 6 has neighbors {1, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 8 has neighbors {3, 13, 16}
- Node 9 has neighbors {3, 7, 12}
- Node 10 has neighbors {0, 1, 7, 19}
- Node 12 has neighbors {9, 15}
- Node 13 has neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 14 has neighbors {0, 19}
- Node 15 has neighbors {1, 4, 12}
- Node 16 has neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 17 has neighbors {7, 11, 18}
- Node 18 has neighbors {6, 17, 19}
- Node 19 has neighbors {0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 51 \)

Therefore, there are 51 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<3, (1, 8, 13)>
<3, (1, 9, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 13)>
<3, (1, 13, 8)>
<3, (1, 13, 9)>
<3, (1, 13, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 16)>
<6, (1, 16, 18)>
<6, (1, 16, 19)>
<6, (16, 2, 4)>
<6, (16, 2, 19)>
<8, (3, 13, 8)>
<10, (1, 7, 10)>
<10, (1, 10, 19)>
<10, (7, 10, 19)>
<15, (1, 4, 15)>
<16, (2, 4, 6)>
<17, (7, 11, 17)>

<19, (6, 10, 19)>
<19, (6, 18, 19)>
<19, (10, 18, 19)>
<19, (14, 18, 19)>
