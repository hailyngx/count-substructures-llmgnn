Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (18, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 13: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 16: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 19: C(3, 3) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 42

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

There are 42 unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, 9, 11>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 14>, <0, 9, 17>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 10, 8>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 5, 18>, <2, 5, 4>, <4, 11, 0>, <4, 11, 19>, <4, 11, 1>, <4, 19, 13>, <5, 6, 18>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 16>, <6, 9, 5>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 7, 13>, <7, 6, 12>, <7, 6, 13>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 17>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 2, 17>, <10, 1, 4>, <10, 1, 8>, <16, 3, 14>, <16, 3, 13>, <16, 6, 14>, <16, 6, 13>, <16, 14, 0>, <16, 14, 13>, <19, 4, 11>, <19, 4, 13>.
