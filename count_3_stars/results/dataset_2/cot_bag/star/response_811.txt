Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 9, 3
- Node 1: 6, 2
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 1, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 0
- Node 4: 7, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2
- Node 5: 4, 7, 6, 2, 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 5, 1, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 3, 6, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4, 2, 0

There are two nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 1 and node 8. They each form one 3-star.
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Each of them can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with its neighbors.

Therefore, there are a total of [2 + 6] = 8 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 2, 6>
- <8, 0, 3>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <9, 0, 2>
