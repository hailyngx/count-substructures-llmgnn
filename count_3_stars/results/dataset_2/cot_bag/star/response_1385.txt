Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (11, 16) (11, 23) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 27) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 17) (27, 16) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 20) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 24) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (19, 16) (19, 4) (25, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 21) (2, 12) (2, 4) (24, 13) (24, 8) (15, 9) (15, 0) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 9) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 29) (21, 4) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 21) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 8) (10, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 23) (20, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (22, 8), (15, 0), (0, 28), (0, 3) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (22, 8, 15)
- Node 1: (7, 1), (5, 1) -> No 3-star
- Node 2: (12, 2), (4, 2) -> No 3-star
- Node 3: (9, 3), (26, 3), (18, 3), (3, 0) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (9, 26, 18)
- Node 4: (19, 4), (25, 4), (4, 21) -> No 3-star
- Node 5: (13, 5), (5, 23), (5, 1), (5, 17), (5, 25) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (13, 23, 1)
- Node 6: (28, 6), (10, 6), (20, 6) -> No 3-star
- Node 7: (13, 7), (1, 7) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: (22, 8), (8, 24), (8, 10), (8, 9) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (22, 24, 9)
- Node 9: (8, 9), (29, 9), (15, 9), (3, 9) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (8, 29, 15)

- Node 13: (7, 13), (5, 13), (13, 21), (13, 24) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (7, 21, 24)
- Node 14: (16, 14), (23, 14) -> No 3-star
- Node 15: (9, 15), (0, 15) -> No 3-star
- Node 16: (11, 16), (16, 29), (16, 19), (16, 14), (27, 16) -> forms 1 3-star with the nodes (11, 29, 19)
