Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 17) (9, 11) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (19, 4) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (18, 12, 19)>, 
<1, (10, 15, 14)>, 
<3, (4, 19, 14)>, 
<4, (3, 19, 14)>, 
<6, (10, 7, 13)>, 
<7, (14, 6, 17)>, 
<8, (10, 3, 17)>, 
<10, (6, 1, 8)>, 
<11, (9, 8, 16)>, 
<14, (3, 1, 7)>, 
<15, (2, 1, 19)>, 
<16, (0, 18, 11)>, 
<17, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<19, (2, 4, 15)>.
