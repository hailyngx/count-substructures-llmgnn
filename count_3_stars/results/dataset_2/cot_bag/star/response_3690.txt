Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the nodes to see which ones have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 7, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
