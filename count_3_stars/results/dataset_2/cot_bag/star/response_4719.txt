Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, and 0.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5:
There are 5 neighbors of node 5: 9, 1, 4, 3, 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>

2. Node 9:
There are 4 neighbors of node 9: 5, 6, 3, 1.
Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>

3. Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 0:
As each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, they each form just 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \)

Therefore, the final result is: [20].
