Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, and 18.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22

So, there are a total of 22 3-stars in the graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: <3, (11, 19, 8)>, <3, (11, 7, 4)>, <3, (19, 11, 6)>, <3, (19, 12, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 18)>, <5, (9, 14, 2)>, <8, (3, 4, 18)>, <8, (3, 8, 2)>, <8, (4, 8, 2)>, <8, (13, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 10, 16)>, <10, (9, 14, 2)>, <11, (3, 7, 17)>, <14, (5, 6, 10)>, <15, (6, 13, 17)>, <17, (15, 18, 11)>.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
