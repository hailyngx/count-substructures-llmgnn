Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation for the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 24), (7, 12), (7, 15), (7, 17). \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 7 as the central node.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors: (24, 7), (24, 4), (24, 18), (24, 14), (24, 2). \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars with node 24 as the central node.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 7), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 1). \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 12 as the central node.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (21, 20), (21, 28), (21, 10).
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (25, 1), (25, 6), (25, 4).
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (23, 2), (23, 27), (23, 16).
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (28, 21), (28, 9), (28, 18).
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (5, 12), (5, 29), (5, 14).
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (17, 7), (17, 3), (17, 9).
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 24), (18, 28), (18, 26), (18, 19). \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 18 as the central node.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (10, 12), (10, 21), (10, 6), (10, 2). \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 10 as the central node.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (0, 16), (0, 29), (0, 15).
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (16, 23), (16, 13), (16, 0).
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 24), (4, 25), (4, 22), (4, 9), (4, 15). \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (29, 5), (29, 0), (29, 3).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor, not forming any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (9, 28), (9, 17), (9, 4).
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (27, 22), (27, 23), (27, 2).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: (6, 25), (6, 26), (6, 10).
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 24), (2, 23), (2, 10), (2, 27). \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node together, we get a total of 51 3-stars: \[ [51] \]
