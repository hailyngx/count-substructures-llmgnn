Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3)
  - (9, 8) (9, 4) 
  - (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3)
  - (7, 4) (7, 6) 
  - (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3)
  - (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3)
  - (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1)
  - (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0)
  - (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0)
  - (2, 4)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they can form 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 10 + 20 = 50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <4, (9, 7, 2)>
- <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- <4, (9, 7, 3)>
- <4, (9, 2, 1)>
- <4, (9, 2, 3)>
- <4, (7, 2, 1)>
- <4, (7, 2, 3)>
- <5, (6, 8, 1)>
- <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- <5, (6, 8, 3)>
- <5, (6, 1, 0)>
- <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- <8, (9, 4, 6)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- <8, (9, 4, 3)>
- <8, (9, 6, 0)>
- <8, (9, 6, 3)>
- <8, (4, 6, 0)>
- <8, (4, 6, 3)>
