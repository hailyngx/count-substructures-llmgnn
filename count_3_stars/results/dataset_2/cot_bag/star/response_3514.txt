Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 19) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 20) (29, 28) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 21) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 15) (17, 18) (20, 1) (20, 28) (20, 17) (20, 21) (21, 11) (21, 20) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 17) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 5) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 25) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 13) (8, 26) (8, 12) (24, 7) (24, 17) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, and 28.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
11. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
12. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
13. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
14. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
15. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
16. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, 9, 26>, <1, 9, 20>, <1, 26, 18>, 
<1, 26, 14>, <6, 9, 16>, <10, 2, 25>, 
<10, 12, 8>, <13, 6, 2>, <13, 19, 15>, 
<13, 19, 0>, <14, 26, 16>, <14, 26, 8>, 
<15, 17, 19>, <15, 17, 5>, <16, 9, 14>, 
<17, 20, 21>, <18, 26, 11>, <18, 17, 7>, 
<19, 1, 10>, <20, 1, 28>, <22, 4, 5>, 
<24, 7, 17>, <27, 7, 28>
