Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars are:
