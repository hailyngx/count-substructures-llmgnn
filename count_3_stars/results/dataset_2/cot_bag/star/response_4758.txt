Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

\[\binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 59\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
1. <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (4, 9, 2)>
4. <3, (4, 6, 3)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 9, 6)>
8. <7, (1, 4, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 6)>
