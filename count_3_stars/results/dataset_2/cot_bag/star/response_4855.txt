Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges based on the given edge list. 

The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, 10
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 11
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 12
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 13, 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, 13, 14
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 9
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 13

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: [4 3-stars]
For node 1: [3 3-stars]
For node 4: [4 3-stars]
For node 6: [1 3-star]
For node 10: [2 3-stars]
For node 11: [2 3-stars]
For node 13: [3 3-stars]

Adding all these up, there are a total of [16 3-stars].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 10)>
<4, (1, 6, 11)>
<4, (2, 6, 10)>
<4, (5, 6, 10)>
<4, (5, 6, 11)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<10, (3, 4, 13)>
<11, (4, 7, 13)>
<11, (9, 13, 14)>
<13, (10, 11, 14)>
<13, (10, 11, 14)>
<13, (11, 13, 14)>
<13, (10, 13, 14)>
<13, (11, 13, 14)>
