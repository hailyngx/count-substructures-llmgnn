Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 19) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 17) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 7) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 19) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes:

- Node 0:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 11:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 12:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 13:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 15:  \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 16:  \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17:  \( \binom{3}{3}  = 1\) 3-star
- Node 18:  \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 18, 8)>, <4, (8, 11, 17)>, <4, (1, 13, 8)>, <4, (13, 11, 6)>, <6, (11, 18, 3)>, <8, (0, 12, 1)>, <8, (12, 19, 8)>, <8, (1, 0, 10)>, <10, (1, 7, 3)>, <15, (16, 12, 17)>, <7, (10, 2, 19)>, <16, (18, 2, 16)>, <18, (0, 5, 6)>.
