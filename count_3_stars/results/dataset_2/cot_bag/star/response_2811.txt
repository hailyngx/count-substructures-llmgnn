Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (2, 18) (2, 23) (2, 24) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 29) (1, 12) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 27) (6, 7) (6, 22) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 25) (4, 29) (8, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 25) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 13) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 4) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 20) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 13) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 12) (21, 3) (21, 24) (22, 6) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 20) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (24, 14) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 21) (7, 6) (7, 28) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 23) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 25) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) 

Response:
The first step is to count the degree of each node since a 3-star needs a central node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 5
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Therefore, we can form 8 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 17, 19)>
<2, (18, 24, 29)>
<3, (10, 12, 15)>
<4, (8, 25, 29)>
<14, (15, 16, 17)>
<18, (2, 4, 29)>
<22, (11, 15, 28)>
<24, (0, 8, 21)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
