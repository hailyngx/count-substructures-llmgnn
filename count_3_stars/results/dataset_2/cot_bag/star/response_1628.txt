Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 1)>
