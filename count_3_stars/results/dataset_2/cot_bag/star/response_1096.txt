Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 7, 13, 11, 14, 2, 5, 10, 3, 4. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 14, 3, 12, 8.
- The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- <6, (9, 3, 12)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 12, 8)>, <6, (3, 12, 8)>, <6, (9, 14, 3)>, <6, (9, 14, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 8)>, <6, (3, 14, 12)>, <6, (3, 14, 8)>, <6, (12, 14, 8)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 6, 8, 11, 10, 7, 0.
- The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- <9, (6, 8, 11)>, <9, (6, 8, 10)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 11, 10)>, <9, (6, 11, 7)>, <9, (6, 11, 0)>, <9, (6, 10, 7)>, <9, (6, 10, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 11, 10)>, <9, (8, 11, 7)>, <9, (8, 11, 0)>, <9, (8, 10, 7)>, <9, (8, 10, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (11, 10, 7)>, <9, (11, 10, 0)>, <9, (11, 7, 0)>, <9, (10, 7, 0)>

For nodes 8, 7, 13, 11, 2, 5, 10, 3, and 4, the calculations are similar:
- Node 8: 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 13: 10 3-stars
- Node 11: 10 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated above, we have a total of 60 unique 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [60].
