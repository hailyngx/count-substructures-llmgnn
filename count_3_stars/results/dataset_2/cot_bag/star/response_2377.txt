Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 78 \)

So, there are a total of 78 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (8, 9, 12)>, <4, (8, 6, 2)>, <5, (6, 0, 13)>, <5, (6, 2, 14)>, <6, (4, 8, 1)>, <6, (4, 8, 3)>, <6, (5, 3, 1)>, <6, (5, 3, 14)>, <12, (4, 5, 10)>, <12, (4, 5, 1)> 

Putting the final answer in brackets: [78]
