Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.
