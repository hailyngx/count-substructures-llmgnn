Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 17) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 22) (17, 24) (17, 9) (17, 27) (4, 13) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (21, 28) (21, 26) (28, 21) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 13) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 29) (11, 20) (11, 8) (11, 7) (27, 22) (27, 25) (27, 17) (27, 6) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (24, 17) (23, 15) (23, 3) (23, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 12) (5, 26) (7, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (0, 9) (2, 20) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 2) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 29) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 14) (29, 8) (29, 3) (29, 13) (14, 25) (14, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 2 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 2 3-stars
- Node 13: 5 3-stars
- Node 15: 3 3-stars
- Node 17: 3 3-stars
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 3 3-stars
- Node 21: 2 3-stars
- Node 22: 2 3-stars
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 2 3-stars
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 2 3-stars
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, (3, 23, 6)>, <9, (22, 10, 17)>, <10, (15, 8, 11)>, <12, (26, 28, 13)>, <13, (9, 25, 29)>, <15, (23, 20, 8)>, <17, (24, 22, 27)>, <18, (12, 21, 7)>, <20, (25, 11, 15)>, <21, (26, 28, 25)>, <22, (9, 27, 17)>, <23, (15, 3, 6)>, <25, (14, 13, 20)>, <26, (5, 12, 21)>, <27, (6, 22, 17)>, <29, (13, 3, 8)>.

These 3-stars are only listed once each even if they appear in multiple combinations.
