Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 65

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
