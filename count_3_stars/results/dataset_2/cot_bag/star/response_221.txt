Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (27, 11) (27, 20) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (7, 0) (7, 19) (21, 26) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 9) (4, 16) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 28) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 0) (28, 23) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (3, 29) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 20) (26, 21) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 25) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 25) (2, 26) (2, 10) (5, 12) (5, 24) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 10) (20, 27) (20, 16) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 20) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 5) (24, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 19) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (7, 13, 16)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <9, (1, 13, 0)>, <9, (4, 13, 16)>, <9, (4, 16, 22)>, <9, (13, 0, 16)>, <9, (13, 18, 0)>, <9, (18, 13, 0)>, <16, (0, 4, 9)>, <16, (4, 9, 13)>, <16, (4, 9, 19)>, <18, (10, 19, 25)>, <19, (10, 18, 25)>
