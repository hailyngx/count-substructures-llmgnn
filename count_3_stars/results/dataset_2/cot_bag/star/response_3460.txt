Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) 

Response:
We will first determine the number of neighbors for each node:  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors  
Node 1 has 3 neighbors   
Node 2 has 2 neighbors  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors  
Node 5 has 7 neighbors  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors  
Node 10 has 4 neighbors  
Node 11 has 3 neighbors  
Node 12 has 3 neighbors  
Node 13 has 6 neighbors  
Node 14 has 3 neighbors  

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \sum_{\text{node } i} \binom{ \text{number of neighbors of node i} }{3} \]

Calculating for each node, we get:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 89 3-stars.  
So, the final answer is [89].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 13, 5)>  
<0, (4, 7, 13)>  
<0, (8, 13, 5)>  
<1, (2, 9, 13)>  
<3, (0, 5, 4)>  
<5, (11, 12, 7)>  
<5, (10, 11, 14)>  
<5, (8, 0, 13)>  
<5, (8, 12, 6)>  
<5, (10, 8, 6)>  
<6, (1, 9, 2)>  
<6, (12, 7, 11)>  
<8, (10, 5, 11)>  
<9, (1, 2, 6)>  
<9, (7, 10, 13)>  
<13, (4, 7, 8)>  
<13, (8, 5, 0)>  
<13, (14, 11, 5)>
