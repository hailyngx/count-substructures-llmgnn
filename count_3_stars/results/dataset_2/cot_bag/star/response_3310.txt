Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the above calculations: 
\( 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80]. 

Unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (14, 7, 13)>
<4, (5, 1, 12)>
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 12)>
<10, (9, 14, 2)>
<11, (0, 14, 4)>
<12, (8, 4, 2)>
<14, (10, 2, 1)>
