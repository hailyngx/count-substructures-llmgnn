Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
1: 3, 6, 7  
3: 1, 10, 6, 12, 4  
6: 1, 3, 14, 10  
7: 1, 10, 11, 2  
8: 13, 4, 5, 11, 0, 12  
13: 8, 12, 4, 2, 9, 0  
4: 3, 8, 13, 14, 2  
0: 8, 13, 5, 9  
10: 3, 6, 7  
11: 8, 14, 7, 5  
14: 4, 6, 11  
5: 8, 0, 11  
2: 13, 4, 7, 9  
9: 13, 0, 2  
12: 3, 8, 13  

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:  
Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 13 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

So, there are a total of \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 45 \) 3-stars in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [45].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<3, (1, 6, 10)>  
<3, (1, 6, 12)>  
<3, (1, 6, 14)>  
<3, (1, 10, 7)>  
<3, (1, 12, 8)>  
<3, (1, 10, 7)>  
<8, (13, 4, 2)>  
<8, (13, 4, 9)>  
<13, (8, 12, 4)>  
<13, (8, 4, 2)>  
<13, (8, 4, 9)>  
<13, (4, 2, 9)>  
<4, (8, 13, 2)>  
<4, (8, 13, 9)>  
<4, (13, 2, 9)>  
<0, (8, 13, 5)>
