Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 6) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 14) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 29) (17, 5) (7, 25) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 21) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 6) (22, 20) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 2) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 12) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (23, 10) (23, 29) (8, 0) (8, 19) (27, 25) (27, 21) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 4) (24, 6) (24, 18) (11, 1) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 4) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 13) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 4) (29, 26) (29, 10) (29, 23) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

1. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 26, 28, and 12.
2. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 29, and 6.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 15, 14, and 6.
4. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 25, and 14.
5. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 18, 23, and 29.
6. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 28, and 21.
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 0, and 6.
8. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 15, 7, 27, and 2.
9. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 26, 3, 14, 21, and 24.
10. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 12, 6, 27, and 4.
11. Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 19.
12. Node 27 has 2 neighbors: 25 and 21.
13. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 26, 17, and 4.
14. Node 24 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 18.
15. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 1, 20, 19, and 4.
16. Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 9, 12, 0, 1, and 13.
17. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 25, and 13.
18. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 28, 2, and 4.
19. Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 26, 10, and 23.
20. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 10, 16, and 24.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 51 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final result is [51].
