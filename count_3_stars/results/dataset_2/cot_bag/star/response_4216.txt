Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 15) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 19) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 6: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is 1.
For node 9: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is 1.
For node 12: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 13: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 14: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 15: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is 1.
For node 16: There are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is 1.
For node 17: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 18: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 34 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 12)>
<9, (4, 7, 19)>
<12, (3, 16, 17)>
<12, (1, 11, 18)>
<13, (2, 5, 14)>
<14, (5, 13, 17)>
<14, (8, 13, 5)>
<15, (3, 4, 19)>
<17, (8, 14, 16)>
<18, (2, 6, 11)>
