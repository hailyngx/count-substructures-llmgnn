Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 1) (0, 12) (0, 23) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 25) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 28) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 24) (21, 24) (21, 6) (21, 25) (24, 16) (24, 26) (24, 21) (24, 29) (24, 25) (28, 18) (28, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 15) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 22) (13, 5) (13, 23) (14, 9) (14, 28) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 27) (27, 19) (27, 6) (27, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 23) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 18) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 24) (25, 15) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 25) (10, 5) (2, 17) (2, 6) 

Response:
Applying the information provided, we construct the 3-star graph with a central node that has three or more neighbors:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \]

Therefore, there are 4060 3-stars in total.

Putting this number inside brackets: [4060]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (3, 17, 6)>
<4, (16, 22, 25)>
<5, (9, 15, 25)>
<6, (1, 2, 27)>
<8, (11, 19, 22)>
<9, (5, 14, 29)>
<12, (0, 18, 20)>
<13, (5, 23, 13)>
<16, (4, 24, 26)>
<18, (4, 12, 28)>
<19, (8, 19, 27)>
<20, (7, 12, 18)>
<21, (6, 24, 25)>
<22, (4, 8, 27)>
<23, (0, 7, 13)>
<24, (16, 21, 29)>
<25, (4, 15, 24)>
<26, (19, 24, 27)>
