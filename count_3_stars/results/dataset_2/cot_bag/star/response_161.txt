Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can construct the following 3-stars and count the total number:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
