Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0 as the center.
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center.
4. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center.
5. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{0} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 4 as the center.
6. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center.
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center.
8. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 11 as the center.
9. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 13 as the center.
10. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 14 as the center.
11. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 16 as the center.
12. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 17 as the center.
13. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 18 as the center.
14. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 19 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
