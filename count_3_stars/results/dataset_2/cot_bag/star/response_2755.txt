Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 8) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 4) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 11) (23, 18) (23, 25) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 25) (5, 12) (5, 24) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 20) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 21) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 26) (24, 12) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 2) (18, 23) (18, 0) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 16) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 6) (16, 0) (16, 29) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 8) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 20) (20, 28) (20, 12) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 19) (2, 7) (27, 1) (27, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes gives us a total of 38 3-stars. So, the final answer is [38].
