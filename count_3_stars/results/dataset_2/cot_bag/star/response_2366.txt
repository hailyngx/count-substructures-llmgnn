Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 19) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can see that nodes 0, 14, 15, and 17 have 4 neighbors each, which means they can form multiple 3-stars. Nodes 1, 9, 10, and 13 have 3 neighbors each, allowing them to form one 3-star for each.  

Let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 8, 12, 9>
- <0, 9, 15, 13>
- <0, 9, 15, 11>
- <0, 11, 9, 15>
- <1, 7, 14, 3>
- <9, 13, 15, 11>
- <10, 17, 18, 7>
- <10, 17, 18, 0>
- <10, 17, 18, 0>
- <10, 17, 7, 1>
- <14, 4, 6, 7>
- <14, 4, 6, 7>
- <14, 7, 1, 19>
- <15, 2, 5, 12>
- <15, 2, 5, 12>
