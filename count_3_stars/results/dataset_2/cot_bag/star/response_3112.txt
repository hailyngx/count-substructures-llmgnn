Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 85 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [85].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (14, 2, 8)>
- <2, (14, 11, 6)>
- <4, (1, 13, 10)>
- <5, (3, 12, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 14)>
- <8, (0, 14, 2)>
- <9, (13, 10, 5)>
- <10, (12, 8, 13)>
- <11, (14, 6, 2)>
- <12, (4, 8, 10)>
- <13, (1, 4, 10)>
- <14, (1, 2, 6)>
