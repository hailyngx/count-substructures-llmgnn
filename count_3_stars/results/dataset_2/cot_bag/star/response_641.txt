Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 16) (6, 14) (6, 29) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 25) (8, 15) (8, 7) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 28) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 28) (18, 13) (21, 28) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 24) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 27) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 25) (5, 18) (5, 21) (19, 17) (19, 1) (15, 8) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 16) (0, 23) (0, 2) (0, 18) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 20) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (20, 24) (20, 16) (27, 11) (27, 17) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 24) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 20) 

Response:
There are some nodes with only one or two edges connected to them, so we can ignore those nodes since they cannot form a 3-star. 

The nodes with three or more edges connected to them are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 23: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 29: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [1+10+10+1+4+10+4+4+10+4+10+4+1+4+1+4+1] = [68]
