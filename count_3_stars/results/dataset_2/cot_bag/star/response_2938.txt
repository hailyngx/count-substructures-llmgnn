Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>
