Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 15) (19, 13) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 16) (8, 5) (8, 11) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 13) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 15) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 4, 7, 12, 10, 0, 14, 17, 5, 16, 13, and 15.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 31 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 17)>
<12, (7, 12, 17)>
<10, (4, 0, 18)>
<0, (10, 3, 11)>
<14, (4, 15, 13)>
<17, (4, 12, 16)>
<5, (7, 8, 1)>
<16, (17, 5, 6)>
<13, (14, 19, 2)>
