Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 15) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 23) (14, 27) (14, 12) (14, 24) (2, 5) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 18) (9, 28) (9, 8) (22, 16) (22, 8) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 23) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 25) (8, 1) (18, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 25) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 23) (29, 26) (29, 21) (27, 14) (26, 29) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 23) (23, 20) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 21) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 21) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 12) 

Response:
With the given information, we can construct the graph as described. Here is the list of nodes with their neighbors based on the provided edges:

- Node 0: {16, 10, 15}
- Node 1: {13, 8, 23}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {11, 20, 28, 12}
- Node 4: {11, 15}
- Node 5: {11, 2, 13, 19}
- Node 6: {28, 24, 8}
- Node 7: {16, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 22, 25, 1}
- Node 9: {28, 8}
- Node 10: {16, 0, 25}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 4}
- Node 12: {14, 3, 26, 21}
- Node 13: {7, 5, 1, 19}
- Node 14: {27, 12, 24}
- Node 15: {4, 0, 23}
- Node 16: {0, 7, 22}
- Node 17: {18, 21}
- Node 18: {20, 17, 28}
- Node 19: {5, 13, 24, 23}
- Node 20: {3, 18, 23}
- Node 21: {17, 29, 25, 12}
- Node 22: {16, 8}
- Node 23: {15, 1, 19, 20}
- Node 24: {14, 6, 19}
- Node 25: {8, 10, 21}
- Node 26: {29, 12}
- Node 27: {14}
- Node 28: {6, 3, 9, 18}
- Node 29: {26, 21}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [9] unique 3-stars: <0, (16, 10, 15)>, <3, (11, 20, 28)>, <5, (11, 2, 13)>, <13, (7, 5, 1)>, <15, (4, 0, 23)>, <16, (0, 7, 22)>, <18, (20, 17, 28)>, <19, (5, 13, 24)>, and <28, (6, 3, 9)>.
