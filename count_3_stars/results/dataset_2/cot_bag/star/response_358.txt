Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 8) (2, 7) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (4, 10) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 10, 11, 17, 7, 12, 1, 9, and 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes gives a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
