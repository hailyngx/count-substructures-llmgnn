Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 17) (0, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (12, 6) (12, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 14) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars
- Node 2 has 2 3-stars
- Node 3 has 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 3-stars
- Node 5 has 2 3-stars
- Node 6 has 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 3-stars
- Node 10 has 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 2 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 3-stars
- Node 16 has 2 3-stars
- Node 17 has 2 3-stars
- Node 18 has 2 3-stars
- Node 19 has 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 30

So, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 5, 18)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<2, (11, 1, 17)>
<3, (16, 14, 5)>
<4, (9, 13, 12)>
<5, (0, 10, 3)>
<6, (8, 12, 1)>
<8, (6, 19, 15)>
<10, (11, 5, 0)>
<11, (10, 2, 5)>
<12, (6, 4, 13)>
<13, (1, 18, 4)>
<14, (3, 16, 15)>
<15, (8, 14, 16)>
<16, (3, 15, 14)>
<17, (19, 2, 0)>
<18, (13, 19, 5)>
<19, (7, 8, 17)>
