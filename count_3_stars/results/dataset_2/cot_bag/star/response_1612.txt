Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have at least three neighbors each. 

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from all these nodes, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>.
