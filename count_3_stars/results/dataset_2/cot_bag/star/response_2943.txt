Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 23) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 4) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 15) (18, 1) (18, 27) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 22) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 12) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (21, 23) (26, 14) (26, 7) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 24) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 18) (27, 26) (27, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 15) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (6, 16) (6, 20) (6, 12) (15, 2) (15, 8) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 67

Thus, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in the graph.
