Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 17) (20, 25) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 20) (25, 23) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 29) (12, 19) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 2) (28, 21) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 2) (29, 22) (29, 6) (29, 24) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (10, 9) (10, 26) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 15) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 11) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 26) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 19) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 19) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 12) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 18, 22, 25, 27, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: No 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors
2. Node 3: 1 3-star
3. Node 5: 1 3-star
4. Node 9: 1 3-star
5. Node 18: C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
6. Node 22: C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
7. Node 25: 1 3-star
8. Node 27: 1 3-star
9. Node 29: C(3,3) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

So, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars are: <3, (1, 21, 25)>, <5, (7, 9, 25)>, <9, (10, 14, 26)>, <18, (16, 13, 22)>, <18, (4, 18, 22)>, <18, (13, 7, 17)>, <18, (18, 0, 4)>, <22, (18, 4, 29)>, <25, (1, 5, 23)>, <27, (11, 17, 19)>, <29, (24, 6, 22)>, <29, (6, 23, 24)>, <29, (22, 4, 6)>
