Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 9) (25, 13) (25, 2) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 8) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 18) (29, 3) (22, 24) (26, 27) (26, 15) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 16) (17, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 24) (2, 25) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 7) (7, 24) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 10) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 27, 20, 15, 28, 29, 26, 9, 3, 11, 23, 18, 19, 12, 16, 21, 24, 13, 8, 5, 10, 14, and 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 69.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69], and the unique 3-stars are:
