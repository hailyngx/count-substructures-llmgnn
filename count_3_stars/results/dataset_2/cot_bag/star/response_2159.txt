Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 4, 7, 3 
- There is only one 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 7, 3)>

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 8, 2, 7
- There is only one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (8, 2, 7)>

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 6, 8, 5, 1, 3
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
<2, (6, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 1)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 5, 1)>, <2, (6, 5, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 5, 1)>, <2, (8, 5, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 6, 9, 5, 2, 0
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
<3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 2)>, <3, (6, 9, 0)>, <3, (6, 5, 2)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>, <3, (9, 5, 2)>, <3, (9, 5, 0)>, <3, (9, 2, 0)>, <3, (5, 2, 0)>

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 6, 9, 8, 0
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
<4, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (6, 9, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 6, 2, 3, 7
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
<5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 5, 3, 2, 8, 4
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 8, 4)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 8, 4)>, <6, (2, 8, 4)>

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 8, 5, 0, 1
- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-star with node 7 as the center:
<7, (8, 5, 0)>, <7, (8, 5, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>, <7, (5, 0, 1)>

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 6, 4, 2, 1, 7
- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
<8, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 1)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 2, 1)>, <8, (6, 2, 7)>, <8, (6, 1, 7)>, <8, (4, 2, 1)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 1, 7)>, <8, (2, 1, 7)>

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 4, 3
- There is only one 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (4, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 45 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [45].
