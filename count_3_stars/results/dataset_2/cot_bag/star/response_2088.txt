Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 23) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 16) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 1) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 28) (16, 29) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 12) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 15) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 10) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 27) (2, 19) (2, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 27) (11, 7) (11, 0) (3, 6) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 20) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 21) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 24) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 21) (21, 5) (21, 15) (21, 20) (10, 18) (10, 24) (23, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42 \)

So, there are a total of 42 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, (0, 12, 21)>, <6, (3, 5, 23)>, <7, (1, 11, 25)>, <8, (9, 22, 24)>, <15, (2, 7, 21)>, <16, (14, 28, 29)>, <17, (26, 29, 22)>, <19, (12, 24, 29)>, <24, (10, 20, 24)>, <25, (4, 13, 28)>.
