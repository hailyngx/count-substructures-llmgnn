Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 4) (14, 8) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 31, which can be represented as [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 10, 12)>, <3, (2, 4, 18)>, <6, (1, 15, 17)>, <7, (0, 11, 17)>, <9, (7, 13, 18)>, <10, (0, 3, 15)>, <11, (7, 17, 19)>, <12, (0, 2, 16)>, <13, (0, 9, 19)>, <16, (6, 12, 19)>, <18, (1, 3, 6)>, <19, (4, 11, 13)>
