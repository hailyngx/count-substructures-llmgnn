Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 22) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 18) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 29) (18, 4) (18, 11) (6, 15) (28, 16) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 5) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 10) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 25) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (20, 23) (20, 24) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 21) (0, 5) (0, 21) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 25) (24, 28) (24, 20) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 47 3-stars.

Thus, the final count of 3-stars is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, 11, 18>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 17>, <4, 18, 11>, <4, 18, 29>, <8, 13, 17>, <8, 13, 22>, <8, 17, 9>, <8, 17, 11>, <9, 17, 11>, <10, 12, 27>, <12, 23, 8>, <13, 22, 4>, <13, 22, 29>, <16, 8, 25>, <17, 9, 3>, <17, 11, 1>, <20, 24, 28>,...
