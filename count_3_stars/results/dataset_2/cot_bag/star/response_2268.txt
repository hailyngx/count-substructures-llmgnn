Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 8) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 2) (8, 15) (8, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 0) (13, 3) (13, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\)
Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 1, 5>
<5, 4, 9>
<6, 1, 10>
<7, 12, 15>
<9, 5, 11>
<10, 6, 18>
<11, 9, 17>
<12, 7, 15>
<15, 7, 12>
<15, 8, 14>
<15, 1, 6>
<17, 11, 7>
