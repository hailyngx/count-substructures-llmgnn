Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes form.

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 82 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in this graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars that are found:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 3, 14>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 13>
- <3, 5, 10>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 13, 14>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 8, 10>
- <10, 11, 13>
- <10, 11, 9>
