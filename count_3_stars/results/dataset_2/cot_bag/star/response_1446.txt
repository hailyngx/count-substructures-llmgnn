Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
       1
     / |  \
    2--3---8
   /| /| x |
  0 4-9 |  |
   \| | / /
    5-6-7
```

From the given edges, the center nodes are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9 as they have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each center node:

- For node 0: 
  - Neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 7
  - Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4

- For node 1: 
  - Neighbors: 9, 2, 4
  - Number of 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1

- For node 3: 
  - Neighbors: 9, 7, 4, 2, 8
  - Number of 3-stars = C(5,3) = 10

- For node 4: 
  - Neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 2
  - Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4

- For node 7: 
  - Neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 8, 0
  - Number of 3-stars = C(5,3) = 10

- For node 9: 
  - Neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 7
  - Number of 3-stars = C(6,3) = 20

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each center node: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 49

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8, 9>, <3, 7, 0, 9>, <4, 7, 5, 9>, <7, 0, 5, 9>
