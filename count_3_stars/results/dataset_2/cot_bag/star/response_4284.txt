Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 24) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 19) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (27, 13) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (29, 22) (29, 27) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 18) (21, 6) (21, 9) (21, 11) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 0) (26, 18) (26, 14) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 25) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 20) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 26) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (2, 27) (2, 16) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 25) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 16) (25, 10) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 11) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 25) (19, 12) (19, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 22, 23, 12, 27, 4, 8, 29, 10, 17, 1, 21, 18, 26, 15, 3, 20, 14, 0, 2, 5, 7, 16, 13, 25, 11, 19. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 9, 22, 23, 12, 27, 4, 8, 29, 10, 17, 1, 21, 18, 26, 15, 3, 20, 14, 0, 2, 5, 7, 16, 13, 25, 11, 19, there is one 3-star each.
  
Total number of 3-stars = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, 9, 21>, <22, 23, 16>, <12, 0, 19>, <27, 2, 13>, <4, 6, 15>, <8, 7, 17>, <29, 22, 27>, <10, 25, 15>, <1, 18, 26>, <21, 11, 9>, <3, 24, 20>, <14, 26, 22>
