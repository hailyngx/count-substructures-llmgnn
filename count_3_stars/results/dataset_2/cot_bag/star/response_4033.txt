Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 16) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (9, 22) (9, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 12) (21, 18) (26, 3) (26, 23) (7, 19) (10, 14) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (16, 25) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 17) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 19) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 18) (1, 28) (1, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2:
   - 3-stars: [4]

2. Node 3:
   - 3-stars: [4]

3. Node 4:
   - 3-stars: [4]

4. Node 5:
   - 3-stars: [4]

5. Node 8:
   - 3-stars: [4]

6. Node 11:
   - 3-stars: [4]

7. Node 13:
   - 3-stars: [4]

8. Node 14:
   - 3-stars: [4]

9. Node 16:
   - 3-stars: [4]

10. Node 17:
    - 3-stars: [4]

11. Node 18:
    - 3-stars: [4]

12. Node 19:
    - 3-stars: [4]

13. Node 20:
    - 3-stars: [4]

14. Node 22:
    - 3-stars: [4]

15. Node 23:
    - 3-stars: [4]

16. Node 24:
    - 3-stars: [4]

17. Node 25:
    - 3-stars: [4]

18. Node 26:
    - 3-stars: [4]

19. Node 29:
    - 3-stars: [4]

Total number of 3-stars: [76]

So, there are 76 unique 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:
<2, (29, 13, 17)>
<3, (25, 11, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 16)>
<5, (6, 12, 24)>
<8, (13, 2, 4)>
<11, (28, 3, 4)>
<13, (2, 8, 29)>
<14, (22, 9, 11)>
<16, (25, 4, 17)>
<17, (2, 0, 20)>
<18, (19, 21, 24)>
<19, (18, 7, 27)>
<20, (3, 17, 12)>
<22, (23, 9, 14)>
<23, (26, 27, 12)>
<24, (29, 5, 18)>
<25, (16, 3, 4)>
