Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list them:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 6 neighbors (0 and 6), the number of 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20 each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors (7, 8, 11), the number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10 each

The total number of 3-stars = 2 * 20 + 4 * 10 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

For the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 9, 12)>
<0, (8, 5, 13)>
<6, (0, 7, 10)>
<6, (8, 9, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 12)>
<7, (9, 0, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 13)>
<8, (6, 7, 10)>
<11, (7, 9, 12)>
<11, (8, 9, 14)>
These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
