Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (7, 6, 15)>
<0, (7, 6, 18)>
<0, (7, 15, 18)>
<0, (6, 15, 18)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<1, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<1, (7, 11, 13)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (1, 5, 14)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 14)>
<4, (5, 9, 14)>

Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<5, (4, 11, 15)>

Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (10, 13, 19)>
<8, (10, 13, 8)>
<8, (10, 19, 8)>
<8, (10, 19, 13)>
<8, (13, 19, 8)>
<8, (13, 19, 15)>
<8, (13, 15, 8)>
<8, (13, 15, 18)>
<8, (19, 15, 18)>
<8, (19, 12, 18)>

Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<12, (13, 18, 19)>
<12, (13, 18, 12)>
<12, (13, 19, 12)>
<12, (18, 19, 12)>

Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<13, (1, 8, 11)>
<13, (1, 8, 19)>
<13, (1, 11, 19)>
<13, (8, 11, 15)>
<13, (8, 15, 19)>
<13, (8, 15, 18)>
<13, (8, 19, 18)>
<13, (11, 15, 19)>
<13, (11, 5, 15)>
<13, (19, 15, 18)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (0, 18, 6)>
<15, (0, 18, 12)>
<15, (0, 6, 18)>
<15, (0, 6, 18)>

Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<18, (0, 15, 19)>

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<19, (8, 12, 18)>
<19, (8, 12, 13)>
<19, (8, 13, 18)>
<19, (12, 13, 18)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].
