Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - 0: {9, 3, 4, 7}
  - 1: {6, 9, 3, 7}
  - 2: {6, 9, 7}
  - 3: {6, 1, 0, 8}
  - 4: {6, 8, 0}
  - 5: {8, 7}
  - 6: {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
  - 7: {1, 8, 0, 2, 5}
  - 8: {9, 3, 4, 5, 7}
  - 9: {6, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Now, let's find the 3-star patterns in this graph.

For node 6: 
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (1, 9, 3, 2, 4), so it forms 10 3-stars.

For node 9: 
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (6, 8, 2, 1, 0), so it forms 10 3-stars.

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 3, 7), so it forms 4 3-stars.

For node 3: 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (6, 1, 0, 8), so it forms 4 3-stars.

For node 4: 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 0), so it forms 1 3-star.

For node 8: 
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (9, 3, 4, 5, 7), so it forms 10 3-stars.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 4, 7), so it forms 4 3-stars.

For node 7: 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 8, 0, 2, 5), so it forms 10 3-stars.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.

For node 5: 
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (8, 7), so it does not form any 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0] = 54. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <6, (1, 9, 3)>, <6, (1, 9, 2)>, <6, (1, 9, 4)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (3, 0, 8)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 0)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (6, 8, 4)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 8)>, <8, (9, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 4, 5)>, <8, (9, 3, 7)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <8, (6, 4, 9)>, <8, (9, 0, 7)>, <0, (9, 3, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 0, 8)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (8, 2, 5)>.
