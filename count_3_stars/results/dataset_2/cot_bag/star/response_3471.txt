Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 8, 13, 10, 11, 4, 7, 12, 0, 14, 9, 1, 6, 2, and 5. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up, we have a total of 77 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [77].
And the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 14)>, <8, (4, 8, 14)>, 
<13, (6, 7, 11)>, <13, (7, 11, 13)>, 
<10, (2, 5, 11)>, 
<11, (1, 2, 11)>, <11, (1, 5, 11)>, <11, (2, 5, 11)>, <11, (2, 6, 11)>, <11, (5, 6, 11)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 10)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 11)>, 
<12, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 12)>, 
<14, (8, 9, 4)>, 
<9, (4, 10, 14)>, 
<1, (6, 8, 11)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 11)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 6, 11)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 12)>, 
<2, (7, 10, 11)>, 
<5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>.
