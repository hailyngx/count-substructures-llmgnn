Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 6) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 14, 16, 12
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 14, 17
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 19, 0, 14
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 12, 11, 13
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 3, 9, 18, 6
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 15, 5, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 18, 19, 6
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 13, 16
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 15, 9, 17
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 8, 2, 16
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 4, 0
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 4, 1, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 15 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 17 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 14 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
- Node 19 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-stars}

Adding these up: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (15, 14, 16)>
- <15, (3, 8, 17)>
- <4, (7, 19, 0)>
- <7, (4, 12, 11)>
- <16, (3, 9, 18)>
- <17, (15, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 18, 19)>
- <6, (1, 13, 16)>
- <8, (15, 9, 17)>
- <9, (8, 2, 16)>
- <14, (3, 15, 0)>
- <19, (4, 1, 13)>
