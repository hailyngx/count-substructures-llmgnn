Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 7) (2, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their neighbors:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 11, 7, 3, 17, 6
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 9, 1, 14
Node 4: 5, 7, 12
Node 5: 19, 4, 0, 7
Node 6: 11, 7, 1, 12
Node 7: 5, 4, 6, 18, 1
Node 8: 13, 14, 10, 15, 12
Node 9: 2, 3
Node 10: 8, 14
Node 11: 16, 1, 19, 6
Node 12: 4, 8, 6
Node 13: 8
Node 14: 3, 8, 10
Node 15: 16, 8
Node 16: 11, 18, 19, 15
Node 17: 1, 19
Node 18: 16, 7
Node 19: 11, 16, 5, 17

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: 1 (Node 4 itself with nodes 5, 7, 12)
Node 5: 1 (Node 5 itself with nodes 19, 4, 0)
Node 7: 1 (Node 7 itself with nodes 5, 4, 6)
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: 0
Node 10: 0
Node 11: 1 (Node 11 itself with nodes 16, 19, 6)
Node 12: 1 (Node 12 itself with nodes 4, 8, 6)
Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 15: 0
Node 16: 1 (Node 16 itself with nodes 11, 18, 19)
Node 17: 0
Node 18: 0
Node 19: 0

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 17, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<5, (19, 4, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<8, (13, 14, 10)>
<11, (16, 19, 6)>
<12, (4, 8, 6)>
<14, (3, 8, 10)>
<16, (11, 18, 19)>
