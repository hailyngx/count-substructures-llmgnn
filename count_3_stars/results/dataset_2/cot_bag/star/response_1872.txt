Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 10) (19, 15) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 4, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46 \) 3-stars. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46, which we can represent as \([46]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 8, 16)>, <3, (0, 16, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 10)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <10, (3, 8, 16)>, <14, (5, 9, 10)>, <15, (11, 12, 19)>, <16, (0, 3, 10)>, <17, (4, 18, 14)>
