Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (8, 5) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes to calculate the number of 3-stars centered around them.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (with 5 neighbors: 7, 6, 3, 5, 14)
- Node 2 (with 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 11, 13)
- Node 3 (with 5 neighbors: 7, 0, 10, 2, 5)
- Node 4 (with 4 neighbors: 12, 5, 6, 2)
- Node 5 (with 5 neighbors: 4, 3, 8, 12, 0)
- Node 10 (with 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 14, 8, 12)
- Node 12 (with 6 neighbors: 4, 1, 5, 13, 10, 11)
- Node 13 (with 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 12, 2)
- Node 14 (with 3 neighbors: 9, 0, 10)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars centered around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 71 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [71].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 14>
- <0, 10, 14>
- <1, 10, 12>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <2, 7, 13>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <3, 5, 12>
- <3, 5, 14>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <4, 5, 12>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <5, 8, 10>
- <6, 4, 12>
- <10, 12, 14>
