Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be described with the following details:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2), (7, 5), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (2, 9), (2, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4)}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we get a total of 41 3-stars inside the brackets [41].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 1)>, <0, (8, 1, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 0, 8)>, <1, (8, 0, 4)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (1, 0, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 0)>, <4, (8, 1, 0)>, <6, (2, 9, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 8, 2)>, <6, (8, 9, 2)>, <6, (9, 8, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (1, 0, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 0, 1)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 2)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 2, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (8, 6, 2)>, <9, (8, 2, 6)>
