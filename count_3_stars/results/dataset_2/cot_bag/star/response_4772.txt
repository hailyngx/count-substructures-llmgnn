Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 23) (4, 27) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 24) (21, 15) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 5) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 25) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 25) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 23) (1, 0) (2, 11) (9, 4) (9, 23) (9, 21) (29, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. Then we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree 3 or more) to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's first find the nodes with their neighbors:

1 => [23, 0]
2 => [11]
3 => [11, 16]
4 => [27, 7, 12, 9]
5 => [28, 24, 19]
6 => [19, 17, 16]
7 => [4, 10, 18]
8 => [15, 28, 26, 25]
9 => [21, 23, 4]
10 => [21, 7, 19]
11 => [21, 3, 2, 24]
12 => [4, 17, 25]
13 => [17, 16]
14 => [29, 25]
15 => [8, 24, 21]
16 => [3, 6, 24, 13]
17 => [0, 12, 25, 13, 6]
18 => [7, 3, 5, 26]
19 => [5, 10, 6]
20 => [0, 24]
21 => [15, 9, 10, 11]
23 => [27, 1, 9]
24 => [15, 20, 11, 5, 16]
25 => [12, 14, 17, 8]
26 => [28, 18, 8]
27 => [4, 23]
28 => [26, 8, 5]
29 => [14]

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors => 10 3-stars
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (27, 7, 12)>
<(17, 12, 25), 6>
<5, (28, 24, 19)>
<8, (15, 28, 26)>
<11, (21, 3, 2)>
<15, (24, 21, 8)>
<17, (25, 13, 16)>
<24, (11, 21, 5)>
<16, (24, 13, 6)>
<23, (27, 1, 9)>
