Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The node-degree sequence for this graph is: [3, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars based on the node-degree sequence:

1. Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
3. Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 4: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
10. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, there are 64 3-stars in total, and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 8, 9)>.
