Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 1) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 0) (22, 17) (23, 2) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 9) (6, 28) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 5) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 10) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 11) (21, 29) (21, 16) (21, 5) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 14) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 0) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 5) (10, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 19) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 13, 17, 18, 22, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the formula mentioned earlier.

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28 \)

So, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<1, (3, 7, 17)>
<1, (3, 17, 18)>
<1, (7, 11, 17)>
<1, (7, 17, 18)>
<1, (11, 17, 18)>
<4, (14, 18, 26)>
<13, (17, 19, 26)>
<13, (17, 24, 26)>
<13, (19, 24, 26)>
<17, (13, 15, 29)>
<17, (15, 18, 29)>
<17, (15, 25, 29)>
<22, (0, 5, 11)>
<22, (5, 21, 26)>
<22, (5, 21, 28)>
<22, (21, 25, 28)>
<29, (14, 21, 29)>
