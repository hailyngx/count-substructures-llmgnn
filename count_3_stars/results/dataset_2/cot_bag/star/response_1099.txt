Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Total neighbors: 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 13)>, <0, (3, 10, 14)>, <0, (4, 10, 13)>

For node 3:
- Total neighbors: 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 12)>, <3, (0, 8, 13)>, <3, (0, 5, 14)>

For node 4:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 10)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 10, 2)>

For node 5:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: 1
- Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (3, 8, 13)>, <8, (3, 5, 13)>, <8, (3, 9, 13)>

For node 9:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 10, 12)>, <9, (1, 10, 4)>, <9, (1, 10, 0)>

For node 10:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <10, (1, 4, 9)>, <10, (1, 4, 0)>, <10, (1, 4, 13)>

For node 12:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: 1
- Unique 3-star: <12, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 13:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: 1
- Unique 3-star: <13, (2, 8, 14)>

For node 14:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: 1
- Unique 3-star: <14, (0, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 74 

So, the final answer is [74].
