Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 16) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 11) (12, 15) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 11, 8, 16, 10, 15, 17, 2, 18, 19, 3, 4, 9, 6, and 13. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 74 3-stars [74]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (11, 12, 15)>
<11, (1, 8, 16)>
<8, (0, 10, 11)>
<16, (5, 9, 11)>
<15, (10, 12, 13)>
<17, (4, 8, 10)>
<18, (1, 19, 16)>
<19, (7, 13, 15)>
