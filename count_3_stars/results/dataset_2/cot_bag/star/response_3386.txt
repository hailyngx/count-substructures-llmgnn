Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 11) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (2, 22) (2, 16) (29, 28) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 12) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 24) (20, 10) (26, 1) (26, 27) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 12) (28, 4) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (18, 7) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 8) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 3) (3, 22) (17, 12) (17, 27) (9, 25) (9, 15) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 15) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 14) (24, 8) (24, 20) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (27, 1) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (10, 20) (10, 6) (10, 5) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 13) (14, 19) (5, 15) (5, 10) (11, 21) (11, 4) 

Response:
First, we can construct the graph based on the given information, with 30 nodes and the corresponding edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: (1, 26), (1, 23), (1, 27), (21, 13), (21, 27), (21, 11), (4, 28), (4, 11), (4, 15), (7, 20), (7, 19), (7, 18), (7, 8), (2, 22), (2, 16), (29, 28), (8, 7), (8, 23), (8, 24), (8, 12), (8, 22), (23, 1), (23, 8), (0, 20), (0, 22), (0, 12), (20, 7), (20, 0), (20, 24), (20, 10), (26, 1), (26, 27), (6, 28), (6, 10), (6, 25), (6, 22), (6, 12), (28, 4), (28, 29), (28, 6), (28, 19), (18, 7), (18, 13), (22, 2), (22, 8), (22, 0), (22, 6), (22, 3), (3, 22), (17, 12), (17, 27), (9, 25), (9, 15), (25, 6), (25, 9), (25, 15), (13, 21), (13, 18), (13, 12), (13, 14), (24, 8), (24, 20), (19, 7), (19, 28), (19, 14), (19, 16), (15, 4), (15, 9), (15, 25), (15, 5), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 6), (12, 17), (12, 13), (27, 1), (27, 21), (27, 26), (27, 17), (10, 20), (10, 6), (10, 5), (16, 2), (16, 19), (14, 13), (14, 19), (5, 15), (5, 10), (11, 21), (11, 4)

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 5 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 2 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: No 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (23, 26, 27)>
- <4, (11, 28, 15)>
- <6, (10, 12, 22)>
- <7, (8, 18, 20)>
- <8, (0, 22, 23)>
- <12, (0, 6, 17)>
- <13, (14, 18, 21)>
- <15, (5, 9, 25)>
- <19, (7, 16, 28)>
- <20, (10, 24, 7)>
- <22, (0, 2, 6)>
- <25, (5, 6, 9)>
- <27, (1, 17, 21)>
- <28, (6, 19, 29)>
