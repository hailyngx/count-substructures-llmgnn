Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (4, 18) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (17, 11) (17, 9) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <11, (16, 17, 19)>
- <11, (8, 15, 19)>
- <11, (8, 15, 17)>
- <11, (8, 15, 16)>
- <11, (8, 15, 3)>
- <11, (8, 17, 19)>
- <11, (8, 16, 17)>
- <11, (8, 16, 19)>
- <11, (15, 16, 17)>
- <11, (15, 16, 19)>
- <3, (1, 13, 15)>
- <3, (1, 13, 9)>
- <3, (1, 9, 15)>
- <3, (13, 9, 15)>
- <15, (1, 9, 17)>
- <15, (1, 9, 19)>
- <15, (1, 9, 13)>
- <15, (9, 13, 17)>
- <6, (1, 10, 12)>
- <9, (13, 17, 19)>
- <18, (4, 5, 8)>
- <18, (4, 5, 14)>
- <18, (4, 8, 14)>
- <18, (5, 8, 14)>
- <13, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (12, 14, 19)>
