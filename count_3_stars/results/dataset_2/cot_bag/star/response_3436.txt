Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

So, there are [38] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 14)>
<0, (4, 8, 12)>
<1, (0, 6, 11)>
<2, (6, 7, 14)>
<4, (0, 8, 12)>
<4, (10, 11, 12)>
<4, (13, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 10, 6)>
<7, (2, 11, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 13)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (10, 11, 4)>
<8, (12, 4, 14)>
<10, (7, 11, 10)>
<11, (1, 6, 0)>
<12, (4, 8, 0)>
<13, (4, 2, 13)>
<14, (0, 2, 12)>
