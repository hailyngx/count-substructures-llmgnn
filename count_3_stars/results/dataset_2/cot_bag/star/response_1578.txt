Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
Node 19 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 8, 19)>
<2, (5, 8, 14)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 14)>
<8, (2, 5, 18)>
<8, (5, 11, 14)>
<14, (1, 13, 18)>
<14, (5, 10, 18)>
