Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 16) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 14) (15, 19) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 18) (4, 9) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 6) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 18) 

Response:
We will first construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 15, 16, and 17
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 10
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 17, 19
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 13, 18
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 17
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 15, 16
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 14, 15, 19
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 14, 16
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 13, 17
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 15, 18

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{16}{3} \) = 560

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [560]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 7, 14)>, <2, (8, 15, 17)>, <3, (4, 6, 3)>, <4, (9, 4, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 12, 17)>, <8, (2, 6, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 16)>, <11, (13, 18, 11)>, <13, (7, 8, 17)>, <14, (1, 15, 16)>, <15, (2, 14, 19)>, <16, (2, 14, 19)>, <17, (7, 13, 17)>, <18, (11, 19, 18)>, <19, (7, 15, 18)>
