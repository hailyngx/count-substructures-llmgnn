Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 18) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 18) (8, 7) (6, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 18) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 18) (10, 12) (10, 3) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 9) (19, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 35.

Hence, there are [35] 3-stars in the graph.
