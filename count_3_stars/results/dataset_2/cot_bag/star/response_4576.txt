Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 28) (28, 13) (29, 16) (29, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 10) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 12) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 16) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 20) (23, 20) (23, 27) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 27) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 19) (27, 10) (3, 13) (3, 29) (3, 19) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 27) (20, 16) (20, 23) (12, 8) (12, 14) (17, 15) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 15) (24, 1) (24, 5) (15, 17) (15, 25) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 22. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 24). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 9), (4, 21), (4, 22), (4, 5), (4, 11). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 21), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 4), (5, 24). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 1), (6, 21), (6, 0), (6, 16). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 25), (8, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: (22, 26), (22, 4), (22, 27), (22, 10). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from all these nodes gives a total of \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 39 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [39]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (6, 14, 24)>, <4, (9, 21, 22)>, <5, (21, 8, 7)>, <6, (1, 21, 16)>, <8, (13, 2, 5)>, and <22, (26, 4, 27)>.
