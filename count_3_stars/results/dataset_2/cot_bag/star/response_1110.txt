Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: 3, 4, 7, 8
2: 4, 6, 7, 8
3: 0, 1, 7, 9
4: 0, 1, 2, 9
5: 6, 8
6: 2, 5, 8
7: 1, 2, 3, 9
8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
9: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 8: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 2)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 4)>, <4, (9, 0, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 5)>, <6, (2, 8, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (4, 9, 8)>, <8, (6, 2, 8)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>, <8, (6, 9, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 0, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.
