Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8, 11
- Node 1: 0, 11
- Node 2: 0, 5, 10, 13, 14
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14
- Node 4: 3, 6, 12, 13
- Node 5: 2, 9, 12
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8, 13
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7
- Node 10: 2, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 11: 0, 1, 10
- Node 12: 3, 4, 5, 10
- Node 13: 2, 4, 6, 10, 14
- Node 14: 2, 10, 13

Calculating the 3-stars:
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Other nodes have less than 3 neighbors or exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 10)>, <3, (0, 4, 12)>, <4, (3, 6, 12)>, <6, (3, 4, 13)>.
