Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows: 
Nodes connected to node 0: 6, 11, 7, 3
Nodes connected to node 1: 6, 10, 8
Nodes connected to node 2: 10, 13, 7, 5
Nodes connected to node 3: 6, 9, 13, 0, 14
Nodes connected to node 4: 11, 8, 5, 14
Nodes connected to node 5: 8, 4, 14, 2
Nodes connected to node 6: 9, 1, 14, 3, 0, 13
Nodes connected to node 7: 10, 0, 2
Nodes connected to node 8: 13, 4, 5, 12, 1
Nodes connected to node 9: 6, 10, 13
Nodes connected to node 10: 9, 11, 7, 1, 2
Nodes connected to node 11: 10, 0, 4
Nodes connected to node 12: 8
Nodes connected to node 13: 6, 9, 8, 2, 3
Nodes connected to node 14: 6, 4, 5, 3

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 11, 7, and 3.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 10, and 8.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 10, 13, and 7.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 9, 13, and 14.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 11, 8, 5, and 14.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 8, 4, and 14.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 1, and 14.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 13, 4, 5, and 1.
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 11, 7, and 1.
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 8, 2, and 3.
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 4, 5, and 3.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:
[38]

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 11, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 10, 8)>
<2, (10, 13, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 13, 14)>
<4, (11, 8, 5)>
<4, (11, 5, 14)>
<4, (8, 5, 14)>
<5, (8, 4, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<8, (13, 4, 5)>
<8, (13, 4, 1)>
