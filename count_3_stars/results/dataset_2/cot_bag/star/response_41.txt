Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 8, 4, 7. It forms 2 3-stars: <5, (6, 2, 8)> and <5, (6, 4, 7)>.

2. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 4, 8. It forms 2 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 8)> and <6, (5, 1, 4)>.

3. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 6, 3, 2, 7. It forms 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

4. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 0, 2, 8. It forms 4 3-stars: <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>.

5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 2. It forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 2)>.

6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 1, 3. It forms 1 3-star: <7, (5, 1, 3)>.

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 3. It forms 0 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

8. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 2. It forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 2, 4)>.

9. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 1, 3, 4, 0. It forms 2 3-stars: <2, (5, 1, 3)> and <2, (5, 3, 0)>.

10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 3. It forms 1 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 3)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of [2+2+4+1+1+1+1+2+1] = [14].
