Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 97\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [97].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (6, 10, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 7)>, <4, (13, 14, 2)>, <5, (13, 0, 8)>, <6, (10, 2, 1)>, <7, (13, 0, 3)>, <8, (5, 10, 12)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>, <10, (9, 6, 2)>, <12, (8, 13, 3)>, <13, (5, 11, 7)>
