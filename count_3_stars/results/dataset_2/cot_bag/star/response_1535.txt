Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 19 nodes with 15 nodes present in the given edge list. All nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 12, 11)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 11, 0, 12)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 13, 10, 12, 7)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 8, 7)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 9, 3)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 6, 1, 7, 4)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 14, 2, 1, 10, 3, 12)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 12, 4)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 8, 13, 14, 2, 11)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 6, 10)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 8, 6, 3, 12, 4)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 5, 9, 8, 6, 11, 10)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 14, 2, 1, 11, 10)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes gives us: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 74 \]
Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, (9, 12, 11)>, 
<9, (5, 11, 0)>, 
<8, (13, 10, 12)>, 
<13, (8, 7)>, 
<0, (9, 3)>, 
<14, (6, 1, 7)>, 
<6, (14, 2, 1)>, 
<11, (5, 9, 7)>, 
<7, (8, 13, 14)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 10)>, 
<10, (8, 6, 3)>, 
<12, (5, 9, 8)>, 
<4, (14, 2, 1)>
