Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we'll first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 4, 9, 7, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 0.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5 as the center.

2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4 as the center.

3. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center.

4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7 as the center.

5. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1 as the center.

6. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center.

7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center.

8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center.

9. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with node 0 as the center.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars calculated above: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 50. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<5, (6, 1, 4)> <4, (5, 9, 7)> <9, (6, 7, 1)> <7, (9, 4, 8)> <1, (5, 9, 3)> <3, (5, 1, 8)> <6, (9, 7, 8)> <8, (4, 7, 1)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
