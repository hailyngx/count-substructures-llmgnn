Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given that there are 15 nodes and 60 edges, the degree of each node can be calculated by dividing the total number of edges by 2 (since each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes). 

Since we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph, let's first determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 6
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 6
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 6
- Node 10: degree = 1
- Node 11: degree = 3
- Node 12: degree = 4
- Node 13: degree = 3
- Node 14: degree = 5

Now, we will identify the nodes with a degree of 3 or more, as they are potential central nodes of 3-stars:

- Central nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14

For each of these central nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:

- Central node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Central node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Central node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Central node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Central node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Central node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Central node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Central node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 92 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 92 3-stars in the given graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

- <4, (7, 11, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 13)>
- <6, (9, 1, 14)>
- <8, (9, 0, 11)>
- <9, (6, 12, 13)>
- <12, (9, 6, 14)>
- <14, (0, 1, 3)> 

The final number to be put inside brackets is [92].
