Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighboring nodes are as follows:
1: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
2: 0, 6, 8, 9
3: 0, 5, 6
4: 0, 8, 9
5: 0, 1, 3, 8
6: 0, 2, 3, 9
7: 0, 1
8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Based on the above information, we can see that nodes 4, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors and thus have the potential to form 3-stars. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)   (as node 4 only has 2 neighbors)

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 5, 2)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 0, 1)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 10 + 4 = 14
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14]
