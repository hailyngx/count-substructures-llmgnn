Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 15) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
<11, (16, 3, 9)>, <11, (16, 4, 9)>, <11, (16, 4, 2)>, <11, (3, 10, 4)>, <11, (9, 10, 4)>, <11, (3, 10, 2)>, <11, (9, 10, 2)>, <11, (16, 3, 4)>, <11, (16, 4, 2)>, <11, (3, 4, 2)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<16, (11, 4, 10)>

Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<17, (9, 19, 5)>

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<13, (8, 19, 9)>, <13, (8, 19, 18)>, <13, (8, 9, 18)>, <13, (19, 9, 18)>

Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<19, (17, 13, 2)>, <19, (17, 5, 2)>, <19, (13, 5, 2)>, <19, (17, 13, 5)>

Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<12, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
<8, (13, 4, 18)>, <8, (13, 4, 6)>, <8, (13, 18, 6)>, <8, (4, 18, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars [ 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 ] = 25. 

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars found is 
<11, (16, 3, 9)>, <11, (16, 4, 9)>, <11, (16, 4, 2)>, <11, (3, 10, 4)>, <11, (9, 10, 4)>, <11, (3, 10, 2)>, <11, (16, 3, 4)>, <11, (3, 4, 2)>, <16, (11, 4, 10)>, <17, (9, 19, 5)>, <13, (8, 19, 9)>, <13, (8, 19, 18)>, <13, (8, 9, 18)>, <13, (19, 9, 18)>, <19, (17, 13, 2)>, <19, (17, 5, 2)>, <19, (13, 5, 2)>, <19, (17, 13, 5)>, <12, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (13, 4, 18)>, <8, (13, 4, 6)>, <8, (13, 18, 6)>, <8, (4, 18, 6)>
