Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more edges: Node 5, Node 8, and Node 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 9, 6, 13, 8, 3, 14
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: 
  <5, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 3, 14)>, <5, (13, 8, 3)>, <5, (13, 3, 14)>, <5, (8, 6, 14)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 5, 4, 13, 2, 0, 12
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 8 as the center:
  <8, (5, 13, 12)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 13, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 12)>, <8, (4, 13, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 12)>, <8, (13, 2, 0)>

For Node 13:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 8, 3, 10
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 13 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 13 as the center:
  <13, (5, 8, 10)>, <13, (5, 9, 3)>, <13, (5, 3, 14)>, <13, (9, 8, 3)>, <13, (9, 3, 10)>, <13, (8, 3, 10)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [ 20 + 20 + 10 ] = [ 50 ] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<5, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 3, 14)>, <5, (13, 8, 3)>, <5, (13, 3, 14)>, <5, (8, 6, 14)>,
<8, (5, 13, 12)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 13, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 12)>, <8, (4, 13, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 12)>, <8, (13, 2, 0)>,
<13, (5, 8, 10)>, <13, (5, 9, 3)>, <13, (5, 3, 14)>, <13, (9, 8, 3)>, <13, (9, 3, 10)>, <13, (8, 3, 10)>
