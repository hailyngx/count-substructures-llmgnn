Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 2, and 7. Thus, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes.

1. Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
4. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
10. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 65 \) 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [65].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:    
<5, (9, 2, 0)>  
<5, (9, 6, 4)>  
<5, (9, 3, 7)>  
<9, (6, 3, 1)>  
<6, (1, 9, 0)>   
<1, (3, 0, 8)>    
<3, (4, 8, 0)>
