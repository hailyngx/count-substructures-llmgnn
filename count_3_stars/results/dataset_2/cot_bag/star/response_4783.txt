Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

So, the nodes with at least 3 neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding them all together: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 56

So, there are 56 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing them uniquely: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 1, 4>
<4, 0, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 8>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 2, 9>
<9, 7, 8>

Thus, the final count is [56].
