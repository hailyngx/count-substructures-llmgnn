Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 23) (12, 1) (12, 16) (2, 1) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 13) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 16) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 13) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 28) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 6) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 20) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 24) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 19) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 13) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: 2  
Node 1: 4  
Node 2: 1  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 3  
Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 2  
Node 8: 2  
Node 9: 4  
Node 10: 4  
Node 11: 3  
Node 12: 2  
Node 13: 5  
Node 14: 4  
Node 15: 4  
Node 16: 5  
Node 17: 2  
Node 18: 3  
Node 19: 4  
Node 20: 3  
Node 22: 3  
Node 23: 4  
Node 24: 3  
Node 25: 3  
Node 26: 4  
Node 27: 3  
Node 28: 3  
Node 29: 3  

The number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors are:  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 4: 1  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 29: 1  
Node 13 forms 2 additional 3-stars with each combination of its neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 30 = 82 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (2, 12, 16)>  
<3, (0, 19, 27)>  
<4, 9, 13>  
<6, (0, 15, 23)>  
<9, 23, 13>  
<10, 15, 23>  
<13, (25, 28, 24)>  
<14, 17, 27>  
<16, 12, 26>  
<19, 26, 27>
