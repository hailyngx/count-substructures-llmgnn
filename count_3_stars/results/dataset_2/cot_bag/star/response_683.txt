Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors - nodes 3, 8, 18, and 14.
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

2. Node 2: Node 2 has 5 neighbors - nodes 1, 6, 7, 14, and 19.
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

3. Node 18: Node 18 has 5 neighbors - nodes 0, 5, 6, 13, and 17.
   Number of 3-stars formed with node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
