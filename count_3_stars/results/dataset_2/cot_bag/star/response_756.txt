Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 19) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 16) (7, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 6) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 15) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 12) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 19
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 15
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 19, 15
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 8, 18, 15
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 10
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 17, 9, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 18, 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 9, 7
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 12, 4
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 15, 1
- Node 13 is connected to node 15
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 12, 19, 10
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 4, 6, 12
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 8, 6
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 18
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 9, 6
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 14, 2, 5, 1

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {6, 17, 9}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {16, 8, 18}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {14, 9, 7}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {11, 14, 15}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes {13, 5, 4}
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 14, 1}

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (6, 17, 9)>, <6, (16, 8, 18)>, <10, (14, 9, 7)>, <12, (11, 14, 15)>, <15, (13, 5, 4)>, <19, (2, 14, 1)>.
