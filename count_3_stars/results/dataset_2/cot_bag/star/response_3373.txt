Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's find the nodes which have at least three neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 0, 7}.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {7, 3, 2, 4}.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {6, 8, 4}.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {5, 2, 9, 0, 7}.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {8, 4, 7, 0}.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 4}.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 9, 3, 1}.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {5, 8, 9, 1}.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 9, 3, 1}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 56 \]

Thus, there are 56 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 2, 9)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [56].
