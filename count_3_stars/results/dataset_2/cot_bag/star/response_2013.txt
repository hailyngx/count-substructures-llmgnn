Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 1) (19, 4) (19, 7) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 17, 5)>
<2, (4, 10, 7)>
<5, (0, 15, 13)>
<6, (8, 0, 9)>
<7, (2, 16, 19)>
<9, (15, 16, 12)>
<11, (3, 1, 18)>
<13, (10, 14, 5)>
<15, (9, 13, 5)>
<16, (9, 7, 12)>
<18, (1, 11, 3)>
<19, (4, 7, 6)>
