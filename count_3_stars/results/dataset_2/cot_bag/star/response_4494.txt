Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:  
Node 0: 3 neighbors  
Node 1: 4 neighbors  
Node 2: 4 neighbors  
Node 3: 3 neighbors  
Node 4: 5 neighbors  
Node 5: 4 neighbors  
Node 6: 4 neighbors  
Node 7: 5 neighbors  
Node 9: 4 neighbors  

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors.

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (9, 7, 6)>  
<1, (9, 7, 4)>  
<1, (9, 4, 3)>  
<1, (4, 7, 5)>  
<1, (7, 4, 3)>  
<2, (9, 7, 3)>  
<2, (7, 4, 5)>  
<3, (4, 1, 7)>  
<3, (4, 1, 8)>  
<4, (9, 7, 5)>  
<4, (5, 7, 3)>  
<5, (7, 1, 4)>  
<5, (7, 1, 8)>  
<6, (9, 7, 0)>  
<6, (7, 4, 5)>  
<7, (9, 0, 6)>  
<7, (0, 4, 6)>  
<8, (1, 9, 7)>  
<9, (2, 7, 6)>  
<9, (6, 0, 4)>
