Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 8) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 9) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will determine the number of 3-stars and list them.

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38 3-stars.

Putting this result inside brackets [] gives us [38].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
- <3, (15, 17, 6)>
- <3, (15, 4, 12)>
- <3, (17, 9, 6)>
- <5, (9, 13, 18)>
- <9, (5, 17, 10)>
- <13, (5, 9, 7)>
- <4, (15, 0, 16)>
- <17, (3, 9, 1)>
- <16, (5, 4, 8)>
- <18, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars are <3, (15, 17, 6)>, <3, (15, 4, 12)>, <3, (17, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 13, 18)>, <9, (5, 17, 10)>, <13, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (15, 0, 16)>, <17, (3, 9, 1)>, <16, (5, 4, 8)>, <18, (5, 7, 8)>.
