Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 7)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 8)>  
<5, (3, 6, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 9)>  
<7, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (2, 4, 9)>  
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
