Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (15, 11) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 22) (25, 3) (25, 10) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 8) (5, 9) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 13) (22, 29) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 4) (26, 17) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 19) (21, 3) (21, 5) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 4) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 23) (17, 28) (17, 26) (17, 13) (0, 16) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 28) (23, 13) (23, 20) (11, 15) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 10) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 4) (20, 2) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 23) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (8, 29) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 10) (10, 25) (10, 24) (10, 8) (27, 1) (27, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
3. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
12. Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
13. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
15. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
16. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of 69 3-stars, which can be represented as \( [69] \).

Some unique 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <2, 20, 21>
2. <4, 7, 14>
3. <7, 19, 21>
4. <8, 1, 27>
5. <9, 4, 26>
6. <12, 1, 28>
7. <13, 17, 28>
8. <16, 0, 22>
9. <17, 13, 28>
10. <20, 21, 23>
11. <22, 16, 20>
12. <24, 10, 28>
13. <26, 4, 21>
14. <29, 8, 22>
