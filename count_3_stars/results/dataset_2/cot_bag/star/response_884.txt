Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 1) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 6) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 4, 2, 9
- Node 1: 17, 16, 9
- Node 2: 0, 12, 9, 7
- Node 3: 11, 18
- Node 4: 8, 0, 15
- Node 5: 19, 15, 7
- Node 6: 17, 18
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 14, 16, 11
- Node 9: 0, 2, 1, 7
- Node 10: 15, 18
- Node 11: 8, 3, 13
- Node 12: 2, 14
- Node 13: 14, 11, 19, 15
- Node 14: 8, 12, 16, 13
- Node 15: 4, 5, 10, 13
- Node 16: 8, 14, 1
- Node 17: 1, 6
- Node 18: 3, 10, 6
- Node 19: 5, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, (4, 2, 9)>
- <1, (17, 16, 9)>
- <2, (0, 12, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 1)>
- <14, (8, 12, 16)>
- <15, (4, 5, 10)>
