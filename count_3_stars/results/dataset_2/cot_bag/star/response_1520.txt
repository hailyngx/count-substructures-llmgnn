Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
13. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
14. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
17. Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
18. Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
20. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
21. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
22. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
23. Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
24. Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
25. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:   
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 65 \)

Therefore, there are 65 3-stars in the given graph.  
\[65\]
