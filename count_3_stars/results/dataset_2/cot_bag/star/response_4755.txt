Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 8, 13, 4, 3, 12, 1, 6, 2, 0, 7, 17, 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <5, (9, 1, 0)> <5, (9, 1, 3)> <5, (9, 0, 3)> <5, (1, 0, 3)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <8, (10, 4, 1)> <8, (10, 4, 7)> <8, (10, 1, 7)> <8, (10, 1, 8)> <8, (10, 7, 8)>
    <8, (13, 4, 1)> <8, (13, 4, 7)> <8, (13, 1, 7)> <8, (13, 1, 8)> <8, (13, 7, 8)>

- For node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <4, (9, 8, 0)> <4, (9, 8, 6)> <4, (9, 0, 6)> <4, (8, 0, 6)>

- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <12, (19, 2, 18)> <12, (19, 2, 12)> <12, (19, 2, 14)> <12, (19, 18, 14)>

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <1, (5, 11, 6)> <1, (5, 11, 8)> <1, (5, 6, 8)> <1, (11, 6, 8)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <6, (4, 15, 18)> <6, (4, 15, 6)> <6, (4, 18, 14)> <6, (15, 18, 14)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <2, (13, 3, 17)> <2, (13, 3, 2)> <2, (13, 3, 12)> <2, (13, 17, 12)> <2, (3, 17, 12)>
    <2, (3, 12, 14)> <2, (17, 12, 14)> <2, (17, 14, 18)> <2, (12, 14, 18)> <2, (3, 14, 18)>

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <0, (5, 10, 11)> <0, (5, 10, 4)> <0, (5, 10, 1)> <0, (10, 4, 1)>

- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- For node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    <18, (12, 6, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars is 31. Therefore, the final answer is [31].
