Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 14) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 16) (12, 9) (12, 14) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be illustrated as follows:

```
    1 -- 11
     \   |  \
        13 -- 5 -- 0 -- 10 -- 8
                  |           |
                  18 -- 3 -- 9 -- 17 -- 1
                   \                 |
                        19 -- 2
                        |
                        16 -- 14 -- 7 -- 12
                           \    |
                              6
```

We need to find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (11, 13, 5)>
- Node 13: 1 3-star <13, (1, 5, 18)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (13, 0, 8)>
- Node 10: 1 3-star <10, (0, 8, 4)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (10, 0, 9)>
- Node 18: 1 3-star <18, (0, 3, 19)>
- Node 14: 1 3-star <14, (7, 16, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
