Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 each have 5 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 114 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [114].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (11, 13, 14)>, <0, (5, 9, 14)>, <0, (6, 9, 14)>, <2, (7, 10, 11)>, <2, (7, 10, 13)>, <2, (7, 10, 9)>, <2, (7, 11, 13)>, <2, (7, 11, 9)>, <2, (10, 11, 13)>, <2, (10, 11, 9)>, <2, (10, 13, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 12)>, <4, (8, 12, 14)>.
