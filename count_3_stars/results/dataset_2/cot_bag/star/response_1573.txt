Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

```
  0 --- 1
   \   /|
    \ / |
     2--9
    /|\  \
   / | \  \
  8--3--4--6
     /    |
    5-----7
```

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding all the possibilities together:

4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are [57] total 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

<1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 1)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
