Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 14) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 17) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 16) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

From the given edge list, we can construct the following adjacency list to identify the number of neighbors for each node:
1: {7, 12, 4}
2: {10, 7, 14}
3: {10, 0, 19, 18}
4: {5, 11, 1, 16}
5: {9, 13, 4, 0}
6: {11, 17}
7: {2, 1}
8: {13, 14, 18}
9: {5, 16}
10: {0, 3, 2}
11: {6, 4, 17}
12: {1}
13: {5, 8, 14}
14: {8, 13, 2, 16}
15: {19, 17}
16: {9, 14, 18, 4}
17: {11, 6, 15}
18: {8, 3, 16}
19: {0, 15, 3}

Nodes 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 18 have at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-star formations around each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 19 3-stars: [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 19, 18)>
<4, (5, 11, 16)>
<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<10, (0, 3, 19)>
<13, (5, 8, 14)>
<14, (8, 13, 16)>
<16, (9, 14, 18)>
<18, (8, 3, 16)>
