Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9

Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7

Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9

Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9

Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9

Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7

Node 6: 2, 4, 5

Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Node 8: 3, 4, 7

Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Based on the list of neighbors for each node, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>

Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>

Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>

Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>

Node 5: [0 3-stars]

Node 6: [1 3-star]
<6, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>

Node 8: [1 3-star]
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [60].
