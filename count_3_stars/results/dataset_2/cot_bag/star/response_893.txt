Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (13, 0) (13, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Nodes 12 and 9 can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Nodes 7 and 1 can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since the nodes 0, 14, 12, 9, 7, and 1 can form 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [68]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (10, 11, 13)>
- <0, (10, 11, 4)>
- <0, (10, 13, 4)>
- <0, (11, 13, 4)>
- <0, (4, 11, 13)>
- <14, (2, 3, 9)>
- <14, (2, 6, 9)>
- <14, (3, 6, 9)>
- <14, (3, 12, 9)>
- <14, (6, 12, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 12)>
- <9, (1, 3, 12)>
- <9, (1, 7, 3)>
- <9, (1, 12, 7)>
- <12, (1, 3, 9)>
- <12, (1, 7, 9)>
- <12, (1, 14, 9)>
- <12, (3, 7, 9)>
- <12, (3, 14, 9)>
- <12, (7, 14, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 11)>
- <7, (1, 9, 11)>
- <7, (1, 11, 8)>
- <7, (1, 9, 8)>
- <1, (7, 9, 12)>
- <1, (7, 9, 3)>
- <1, (9, 12, 3)>
- <1, (12, 7, 3)>
