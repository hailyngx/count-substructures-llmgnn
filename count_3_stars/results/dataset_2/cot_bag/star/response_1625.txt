Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7, 8, 6, 10), thus [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (5, 3, 14), so only 1 3-star with node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 9, 3, 14), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (7, 1, 13, 2), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (9, 7, 13, 0), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (6, 2, 1, 8, 12), thus [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (13, 14, 10, 0, 5), thus [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 0, 3, 8), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (5, 7, 13, 0), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (4, 2, 11, 14), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 9.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (13, 6, 0), so only 1 3-star with node 10.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (5, 13, 11), so only 1 3-star with node 12.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: (4, 3, 8, 12, 10, 6), thus [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars with node 13.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (9, 1, 6, 2), thus [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 67 

So, there are 67 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>, <0, (4, 8, 10)>, <0, (7, 8, 6)>, <0, (7, 8, 10)>, <0, (4, 8, 6)>, <1, (5, 3, 14)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>, <2, (5, 3, 14)>, <3, (7, 1, 13)>, <3, (7, 1, 2)>, <3, (7, 13, 2)>, <4, (9, 7, 13)>, <4, (9, 13, 0)>, <4, (7, 13, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 12)>, <5, (2, 8, 12)>, <5, (1, 8, 12)>, <6, (14, 10, 0)>, <7, (3, 13, 8)>, <8, (13, 0, 5)>, <8, (13, 5, 12)>, <8, (0, 5, 12)>, <13, (6, 10, 0)>, <14, (9, 6, 2)>.

Thus, the final answer is [67].
