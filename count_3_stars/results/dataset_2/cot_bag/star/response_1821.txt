Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 24) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 18) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 16) (5, 24) (5, 20) (19, 22) (19, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 27) (12, 25) (12, 6) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 20) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 23) (11, 13) (7, 1) (27, 9) (27, 22) (27, 6) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 25) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 5) (14, 29) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 23) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 14) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 28) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 20) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph with 30 nodes and corresponding edges as described. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars associated with each of those nodes.

The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 3, 15, 2, 29, 10, 17, 4, 8, 26, 21, 16, 22, 0, 9, 27, 6, 24, 14, 18, 25, 28, 20.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes and sum them up:

- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all these counts: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 60 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (15, 21, 26)>, 
<15, (3, 0, 22)>, 
<2, (29, 1, 28)>, 
<10, (17, 8, 23)>, 
<17, (10, 9, 4)>, 
<4, (17, 8, 14)>, 
<8, (10, 4, 26)>, 
<26, (3, 8, 18)>, 
<21, (3, 10, 16)>, 
<16, (13, 21, 22)>, 
<22, (15, 19, 27)>, 
<0, (15, 16, 23)>, 
<9, (17, 14, 27)>, 
<27, (9, 6, 22)>,
