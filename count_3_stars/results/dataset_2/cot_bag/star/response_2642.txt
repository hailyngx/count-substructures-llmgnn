Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 5, 4, 7, 10, 11, 2, 8, 3, 1, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (8, 12, 10)>
    - <5, (8, 12, 4)>
    - <5, (12, 10, 4)>
    - <5, (8, 10, 4)>

2. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (5, 12, 7)>
    - <4, (5, 12, 11)>
    - <4, (5, 11, 3)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 3)>
    - <4, (12, 7, 11)>
    - <4, (12, 11, 3)>
    - <4, (7, 11, 3)>
    - <4, (5, 12, 11)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 3)>
    - <4, (12, 7, 11)>

3. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (4, 1, 13)>
    - <7, (4, 13, 3)>
    - <7, (1, 13, 1)>
    - <7, (4, 13, 3)>

4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <10, (5, 11, 6)>
    - <10, (5, 11, 2)>
    - <10, (11, 6, 2)>
    - <10, (5, 11, 6)>

5. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <11, (9, 4, 6)>
    - <11, (9, 4, 14)>
    - <11, (9, 6, 14)>
    - <11, (4, 6, 14)>
    - <11, (9, 4, 6)>
    - <11, (9, 4, 14)>
    - <11, (9, 6, 14)>
    - <11, (4, 6, 14)>
    - <11, (9, 4, 6)>
    - <11, (9, 4, 14)>

6. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <2, (10, 8, 1)>
    - <2, (10, 8, 3)>
    - <2, (8, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (10, 8, 1)>

7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <8, (5, 9, 14)>
    - <8, (5, 9, 6)>
    - <8, (9, 14, 6)>
    - <8, (5, 9, 14)>

8. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <3, (4, 7, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (7, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (7, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (7, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 14)>

9. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

10. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <13, (9, 7, 0)>
    - <13, (9, 0, 14)>
    - <13, (7, 0, 14)>
    - <13, (9, 7, 0)>

Adding up all the formed 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 = 50\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [50].
