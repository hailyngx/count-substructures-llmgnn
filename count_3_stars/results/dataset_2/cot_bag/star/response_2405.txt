Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (18, 19) (18, 24) (18, 25) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 8) (10, 0) (10, 28) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 23) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 18) (19, 11) (26, 27) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 16) (15, 24) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 2) (11, 21) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 4) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (27, 16) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 3) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 22) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 1) (25, 18) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 23) (28, 10) (28, 12) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 28) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 21, 0, 20, 2, 18, 22, 7, 11, 27, 29, 3, 24, 8, 25, 16, 12, 4, and 23. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Adding them up:  
1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [61].

And the unique 3-stars are:  
<5, (9, 4, 20)>  
<1, (21, 25, 16)>  
<0, (10, 20, 2)>  
<20, (5, 22, 0)>  
<2, (7, 11, 19)>  
<18, (19, 24, 25)>  
<22, (27, 26, 8)>  
<7, (17, 1, 2)>  
<11, (21, 2, 19)>  
<27, (22, 26, 29)>  
<29, (14, 27, 23)>  
<3, (2, 29, 24)>  
<24, (18, 15, 3)>  
<8, (22, 3, 12)>  
<25, (1, 18, 16)>  
<16, (1, 6, 27)>  
<12, (21, 8, 28)>  
<4, (5, 11, 23)>
