Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 19) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 4) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 18) (11, 5) (11, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 15) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars.

Looking at the list of edges, we see that the degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3.
- Node 1 has degree 2.
- Node 2 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 3.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 9 has degree 3.
- Node 10 has degree 4.
- Node 11 has degree 2.
- Node 12 has degree 3.
- Node 13 has degree 3.
- Node 14 has degree 3.
- Node 15 has degree 4.
- Node 16 has degree 3.
- Node 17 has degree 3.
- Node 18 has degree 3.
- Node 19 has degree 3.

We can see that nodes 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 19 have degrees higher than 3, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (2, 10, 15)>
- <4, (12, 16, 19)>
- <7, (6, 9, 15)>
- <10, (15, 17, 19)>
