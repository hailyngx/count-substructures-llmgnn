Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Nodes with degrees less than 3 do not form 3-stars.
Nodes with degree 3 form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula and information provided:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 12, 13)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 13)>
- <13, (0, 7, 14)>
