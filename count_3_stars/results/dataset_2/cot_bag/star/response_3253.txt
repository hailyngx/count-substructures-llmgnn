Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 18) (16, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 28) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (17, 3) (17, 23) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 8) (21, 26) (21, 28) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (1, 26) (1, 24) (1, 27) (22, 11) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 23) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 19) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 27) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 28) (8, 3) (12, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 18) (2, 5) (2, 27) (19, 28) (19, 7) (19, 24) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 14) (4, 20) (4, 0) (13, 23) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 \)

Thus, there are 36 total 3-stars in this graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets []:
\[ [36] \]
