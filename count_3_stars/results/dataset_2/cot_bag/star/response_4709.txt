Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 5) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 2) (14, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 16) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node gives a total of 36 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (15, 1, 16)>
- <3, (11, 3, 16)>
- <4, (5, 4, 15)>
- <5, (2, 5, 14)>
- <6, (10, 6, 17)>
- <7, (0, 7, 17)>
- <8, (1, 8, 13)>
- <9, (6, 9, 16)>
- <10, (17, 6, 10)>
- <12, (0, 12, 19)>
- <15, (1, 15, 4)>
- <16, (1, 16, 6)>
