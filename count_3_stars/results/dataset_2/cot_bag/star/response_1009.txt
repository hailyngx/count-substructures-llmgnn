Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 28) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 7) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 24) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 6) (7, 27) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 19) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (18, 0) (18, 29) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 17) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 21) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 1) (29, 18) (29, 22) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 24) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 29) (22, 28) (6, 0) (6, 19) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 22) (21, 4) (21, 5) (21, 11) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 1
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 5
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 1
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 2

We see that nodes 4, 13, and 19 have degree 5, which means they can form 5 3-stars each. Nodes 12 and 17 have degree 4, which means they can form 4 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3}] = [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 0] = [28] \]

Therefore, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (8, 19, 25)>
- <13, (4, 5, 3)>
- <19, (12, 4, 16)>
- <17, (12, 20, 3)>
- <12, (27, 5, 17)>
- <13, (5, 3, 10)>
- <13, (5, 10, 28)>
- <13, (4, 10, 15)>
- <13, (3, 17, 10)>
- <4, (13, 5, 21)>
- <19, (24, 6, 19)>
- <19, (24, 19, 6)>
- <19, (24, 16, 19)>
- <12, (27, 7, 5)>
- <4, (21, 5, 11)>
- <19, (24, 16, 19)>
- <12, (27, 7, 5)>
- <19, (24, 16, 19)>
- <4, (21, 5, 11)>
