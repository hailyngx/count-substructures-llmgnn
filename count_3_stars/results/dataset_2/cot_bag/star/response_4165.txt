Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 26) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 24) (3, 2) (23, 11) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 12) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 14) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 29) (28, 11) (28, 29) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 14) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 25) (15, 5) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 26) (9, 13) (9, 22) (9, 24) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 5) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (8, 14) (8, 25) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 25) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 9) (24, 19) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 8) (14, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 5) (19, 6) (19, 24) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 
- Node 11 with neighbors 28, 23, 1, and 5
- Node 23 with neighbors 11, 22, 15, and 12
- Node 15 with neighbors 23, 20, 25, and 5
- Node 27 with neighbors 22, 12, and 29
- Node 29 with neighbors 27, 28, 14

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

Node 11 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<11, (28, 23, 1)>, <11, (28, 23, 5)>, <11, (23, 1, 5)>, <11, (28, 1, 5)>

Node 23 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<23, (11, 22, 15)>, <23, (11, 22, 12)>, <23, (11, 15, 12)>, <23, (22, 15, 12)>

Node 15 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<15, (23, 20, 25)>, <15, (23, 20, 5)>, <15, (23, 25, 5)>, <15, (20, 25, 5)>

Node 27 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<27, (22, 12, 29)>

Node 29 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<29, (27, 28, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 14. 

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<11, (28, 23, 1)>, <11, (28, 23, 5)>, <11, (23, 1, 5)>, <11, (28, 1, 5)>,
<23, (11, 22, 15)>, <23, (11, 22, 12)>, <23, (11, 15, 12)>, <23, (22, 15, 12)>,
<15, (23, 20, 25)>, <15, (23, 20, 5)>, <15, (23, 25, 5)>, <15, (20, 25, 5)>,
<27, (22, 12, 29)>,
<29, (27, 28, 14)>.
