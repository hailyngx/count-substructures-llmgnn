Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 25) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 12) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 29) (2, 23) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 19) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 26) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 13) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 25) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 10) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 10) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 26) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (11, 21) (11, 8) (19, 1) (19, 29) (14, 3) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 18) (28, 2) (28, 0) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 11) (24, 5) (24, 12) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 0) (16, 6) (16, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 4

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with degree at least 3, we find:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 20 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
