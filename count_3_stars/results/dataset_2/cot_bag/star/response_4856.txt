Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 11: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 80\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 80.
Putting this final number inside brackets: [80]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 13>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 7, 14>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 12, 3>
<5, 7, 1>
<8, 11, 12>
<11, 12, 3>
<11, 2, 4>
