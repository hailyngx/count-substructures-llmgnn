Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 74

So, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
