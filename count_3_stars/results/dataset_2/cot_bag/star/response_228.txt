Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 16) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 13) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 17, 7, 10
- Node 1: 13
- Node 2: 17, 4, 10
- Node 3: 9, 5
- Node 4: 8, 2, 13, 10
- Node 5: 3, 17, 19, 12
- Node 6: 8, 16, 10, 18
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 14, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 7, 16, 12
- Node 10: 4, 0, 6, 2
- Node 11: 19, 13
- Node 12: 5, 9
- Node 13: 4, 11, 1
- Node 14: 15, 17, 8
- Node 15: 19, 16, 14
- Node 16: 15, 9, 6
- Node 17: 14, 0, 5, 2
- Node 18: 19, 6
- Node 19: 15, 5, 18, 11

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Summing all the 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (7, 10, 17)>
- <2, (4, 10, 17)>
- <4, (8, 10, 13)>
- <5, (3, 12, 19)>
- <6, (8, 10, 16)>
- <9, (3, 7, 16)>
- <10, (0, 2, 6)>
- <13, (1, 11, 4)>
- <14, (15, 17, 8)>
- <15, (14, 16, 19)>
- <16, (6, 9, 15)>
- <17, (2, 5, 14)>
- <19, (5, 11, 18)>
