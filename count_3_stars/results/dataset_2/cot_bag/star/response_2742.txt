Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Considering the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 5
- Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 7, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 8, 3
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 9, 4, 5, 2
- Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 7, 0, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 5, 7, 3, 4
- Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 4, 0, 5, 1
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 2, 0, 1
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 3, 1, 0

Based on the neighbors of each node, we find the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (9, 7, 8)> 
- Node 3: <3, (6, 4, 5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
