Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \[ [1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [72] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (8, 9, 12)>, 
<2, (8, 7, 3)>, 
<2, (8, 4, 13)>, 
<2, (5, 3, 11)>, 
<2, (5, 10, 12)>, 
<3, (13, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (13, 9, 2)>, 
<5, (2, 11, 3)>, 
<5, (2, 12, 10)>, 
<7, (13, 3, 2)>, 
<9, (13, 3, 4)>, 
<10, (9, 12, 5)>, 
<11, (2, 5, 3)>, 
<11, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<11, (5, 12, 10)>
