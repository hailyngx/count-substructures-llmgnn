Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Upon inspection, nodes 1, 6, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so they could potentially form 3-stars.

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 9:
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 10 + 10 = 21 \).

Putting the final number inside brackets [], we have [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
