Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 8, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 1
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 1, 7

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 8, 0), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 6)>, <5, (9, 0, 6)>, <5, (8, 0, 6)>
  
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (9, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 6)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (3, 6, 2)>, <7, (9, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (3, 8, 2)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>
  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 4, 3, 1, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 10 = 34]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 34.
