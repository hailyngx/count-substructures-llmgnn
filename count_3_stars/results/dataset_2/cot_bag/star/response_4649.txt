Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 17) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 17) (7, 2) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
Node 18 has 1 neighbor.
Node 19 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:
- Nodes 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, and 16 form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 3, 5, 8, 12, and 13 form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 6 \times 4 + 5 \times 1 = 24 + 5 = 29 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 5, 19)>, <2, (7, 16, 12)>, <4, (6, 11, 16)>, <9, (6, 11, 15)>, <10, (11, 15, 16)>, <16, (17, 10, 2)>, <3, (5, 8, 13)>
