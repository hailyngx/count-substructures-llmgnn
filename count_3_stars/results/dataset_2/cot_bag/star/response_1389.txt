Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, and <0, (1, 6, 9)> - 3 stars
- Node 1 forms <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, and a total of <1, 3 stars>
- Node 3 forms <3, (0, 5, 7)> and a total of <1, 3 stars>
- Node 4 forms <4, (0, 6, 7)> - 1 star
- Node 6 forms <6, (0, 1, 9)> - 1 star
- Node 7 forms <7, (0, 4, 5)> - 1 star
- Node 9 forms <9, (1, 6, 7)> - 1 star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
