Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 20) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 8) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 29) (15, 27) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (8, 26) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 21) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 19) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 25) (4, 12) (4, 16) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 24) (22, 15) (22, 27) (22, 0) (22, 19) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 23) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 28) (20, 9) (20, 24) (29, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 28) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 17) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 28) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 18) (28, 24) 

Response:
There are two nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 0 and node 22. So we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 0, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) possible 3-stars:
<0, (3, 21, 16)>, <0, (3, 21, 17)>, <0, (3, 21, 22)>, <0, (16, 19, 24)>

For node 22, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) possible 3-stars:
<22, (0, 19, 27)>, <22, (0, 19, 28)>, <22, (15, 19, 27)>, <22, (15, 19, 28)>

Summing these up, we have a total of 8 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
