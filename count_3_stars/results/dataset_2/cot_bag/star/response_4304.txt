Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
There are seven nodes with three or more neighbors which we'll analyze for 3-stars: 

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 10), (0, 4), (0, 10), (0, 5)
2. Node 3: (3, 13), (3, 12), (3, 14)
3. Node 7: (7, 17), (7, 6), (7, 15), (7, 18)
4. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 2)
5. Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 19), (11, 18), (11, 15)
6. Node 15: (15, 17), (15, 11), (15, 2), (15, 7), (15, 16)
7. Node 16: (16, 6), (16, 9), (16, 19), (16, 15)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: [6]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 7: [4]
- Node 8: [3]
- Node 11: [4]
- Node 15: [10]
- Node 16: [4]

Adding these together gives a total of [28] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 10, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 10)>
<3, (12, 13, 14)>
<7, (15, 17, 18)>
<7, (18, 19, 11)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 10)>
<8, (2, 5, 10)>
<11, (10, 18, 19)>
<11, (15, 17, 18)>
<15, (2, 7, 11)>
<15, (2, 7, 15)>
<15, (2, 11, 16)>
<15, (2, 15, 16)>
<15, (7, 11, 16)>
<15, (7, 15, 16)>
<15, (11, 15, 17)>
<15, (11, 16, 17)>
<15, (15, 16, 17)>
<16, (6, 9, 15)>
<16, (6, 15, 19)>
<16, (9, 15, 19)>
<16, (9, 16, 19)>
