Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 14) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 17) (23, 9) (21, 16) (21, 29) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 14) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 19) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 3) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 29) (28, 6) (28, 16) (26, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 1) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 14) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 6) (24, 0) (19, 0) (19, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (1, 6) (1, 11) (12, 4) (12, 9) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 17) (2, 25) (2, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 5) (17, 7) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 27, 15, 24, 19
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 16, 3
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 25, 14, 17
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 8, 26, 5, 11, 23
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 0, 18, 20, 14
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 22, 15, 11, 20, 17
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 5, 29, 18
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 17, 9
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 4, 21, 28, 14
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 22, 21, 6
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 18, 15, 3, 19
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 13, 22, 3
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 28, 1, 29
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 11, 12
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 4, 9, 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 23, 12, 17
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 25, 17

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} ] = [ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 ] = [ 47 ] \]

So, there are 47 total 3-stars in this graph.
