Since there are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using each node that has 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

For Node 0: [1, 3, 5] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 1: [0, 7, 13, 17] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: [11, 13, 16, 18, 19] -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: [0, 4, 10, 17] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: [3, 6, 14] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 5: [0, 15] -> \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: [4, 13, 14] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 7: [1, 8, 13, 19] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: [7, 10, 12] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 9: [11, 16] -> \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For Node 10: [3, 8, 12, 19] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 11: [2, 9, 14] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 12: [8, 10] -> \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For Node 13: [1, 2, 6, 7] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 14: [4, 6, 11, 15] -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 15: [5, 14, 17] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 16: [2, 9] -> \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For Node 17: [1, 3, 15] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 18: [2] -> \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For Node 19: [2, 7, 10] -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 2, 13>
<1, 2, 17>
<1, 7, 13>
<2, 11, 13>
<2, 11, 16>
<2, 13, 16>
<2, 16, 18>
<2, 16, 19>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 14>
<3, 10, 19>
<4, 6, 13>
<4, 6, 14>
<4, 11, 14>
<7, 8, 19>
<7, 13, 19>
<11, 14, 15>
<14, 15, 17>
