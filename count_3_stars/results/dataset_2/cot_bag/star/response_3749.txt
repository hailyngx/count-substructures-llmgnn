Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (22, 5) (22, 0) (22, 20) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 29) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 23) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 23) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 28) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 22) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 16) (24, 18) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 14) (14, 11) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 18) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (21, 13) (21, 26) (27, 28) (27, 29) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 10) (15, 16) (23, 20) (23, 28) 

Response:
This graph has a total of 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, 17, 20}. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (22, 5), (20, 29), (0, 11), (0, 12). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (6, 1), (20, 1), (1, 16), (1, 26). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 4), (12, 4), (4, 17), (4, 8). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9), (1, 6), (6, 17), (6, 28). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (10, 0), (2, 10), (10, 18), (10, 19), (11, 10). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 0), (4, 12), (12, 7), (10, 12). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (6, 17), (4, 17), (7, 17), (17, 18). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: (22, 20), (29, 20), (1, 20), (20, 23). Total 3-stars: [1]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a final count of [8] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (11, 0, 12)>
- <1, (1, 16, 26)>
- <4, (4, 8, 12)>
- <6, (6, 17, 28)>
- <10, (10, 18, 19)>
- <12, (7, 10, 12)>
- <17, (4, 7, 18)>
- <20, (1, 23, 29)>
