Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 1, 9, 11, 13, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
    <6, (1, 7, 12)>, <6, (7, 8, 12)>, <6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (1, 8, 13)>, <6, (1, 12, 13)>

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <1, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (0, 5, 12)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 12)>, <1, (0, 4, 12)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <9, (2, 7, 11)>, <9, (2, 7, 13)>, <9, (2, 11, 13)>, <9, (7, 11, 13)>

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <11, (5, 9, 13)>, <11, (3, 5, 13)>, <11, (3, 5, 14)>, <11, (3, 9, 14)>, <11, (5, 9, 14)>

- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
    <13, (2, 4, 5)>, <13, (2, 4, 8)>, <13, (2, 4, 13)>, <13, (2, 5, 8)>, <13, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <0, (7, 8, 14)>, <0, (1, 4, 14)>, <0, (1, 8, 14)>, <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <0, (7, 1, 4)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 74 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 74, which can be represented as [74].
