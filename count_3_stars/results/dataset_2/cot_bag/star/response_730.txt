Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 6, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 0, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 0, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( C(4, 3) + C(3, 3) = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
- Node 5: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)

Adding all the 3-stars that can be formed, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 10 + 5 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 7, 2)>
- <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- <2, (4, 6, 0)>
- <3, (5, 9, 0)>
- <5, (9, 8, 1)>
- <6, (8, 2, 0)>
- <7, (8, 3, 2)>
- <8, (9, 7, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>
