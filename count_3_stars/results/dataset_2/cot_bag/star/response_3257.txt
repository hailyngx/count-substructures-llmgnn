Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following nodes and connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (5, 2, 7)>
- <0, (5, 2, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (7, 8, 6)>
