Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 19) (2, 19) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 15) (4, 18) (4, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 6) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 68 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 19, 0)>
<1, (4, 15, 1)>
<4, (15, 18, 4)>
<6, (10, 16, 6)>
<7, (1, 14, 7)>
<8, (13, 1, 8)>
<9, (5, 16, 9)>
<10, (3, 15, 10)>
<13, (8, 19, 13)>
<14, (16, 18, 14)>
<15, (10, 19, 15)>
<16, (6, 9, 16)>
<17, (11, 7, 17)>
<19, (0, 13, 19)>
