Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 16, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
