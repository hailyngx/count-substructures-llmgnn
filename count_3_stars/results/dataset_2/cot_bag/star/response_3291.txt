Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 21) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 27) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 28) (25, 2) (20, 7) (20, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 8) (2, 25) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (29, 18) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 27) (4, 12) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 4) (1, 10) (1, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 16) (21, 26) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 14) (0, 2) (0, 23) (19, 20) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 23) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 22) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (9, 25, 10)>
<5, (18, 13, 11)>
<7, (20, 8, 14)>
<8, (10, 17, 1)>
<10, (3, 25, 1)>
<13, (5, 27, 14)>
<14, (7, 8, 13)>
<16, (28, 23, 15)>
<17, (10, 28, 8)>
<18, (6, 29, 2)>
<22, (3, 21, 8)>
<24, (6, 4, 14)>
<25, (3, 28, 2)>
<26, (9, 21, 15)>
<28, (25, 16, 17)>
