Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (17, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (18, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 18) (9, 0) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors: 11, 16, 1, 5, 6, 8, 0, 14, 4, 12, 15, and 10.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 88.

So, there are 88 3-stars in total.
