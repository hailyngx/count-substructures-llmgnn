Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 12), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 2), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (6, 14), (6, 7), (6, 0), (2, 1), (12, 13), (12, 10), (12, 11), (1, 10), (7, 11), (7, 10), (11, 13), (0, 13), (3, 14)}

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 9, 6, and 2: <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, and 2: <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 9, 4, and 13: <12, (9, 4, 13)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 5, 10, and 2: <1, (5, 10, 2)>
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, and 13: <0, (5, 8, 13)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 5, 14, and 7: <6, (5, 14, 7)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 12, 1, and 0: <13, (12, 1, 0)>

Adding these unique 3-stars gives a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
