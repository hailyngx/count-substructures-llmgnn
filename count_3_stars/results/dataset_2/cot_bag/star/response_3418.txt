Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 0 and Node 3 each have 4 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each: 
  From Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>
  From Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 2 and Node 6 each have 5 neighbors, so they form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each: 
  From Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 3)>, <2, (0, 6, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>
  From Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 0)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 31 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].
