Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 6, 9, 4, 7, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 14, 7, 4, 0.
- The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- The unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center are <6, (9, 14, 7)>, <6, (9, 14, 4)>, <6, (9, 14, 0)>, <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (14, 7, 4)>, <6, (14, 7, 0)>, <6, (14, 4, 0)>, <6, (7, 4, 0)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 6, 2, 14, 10, 13, 0.
- The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- The unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center are <9, (6, 2, 14)>, <9, (6, 2, 10)>, <9, (6, 2, 13)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 14, 10)>, <9, (6, 14, 13)>, <9, (6, 14, 0)>, <9, (6, 10, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 0)>, <9, (6, 13, 0)>, <9, (2, 14, 10)>, <9, (2, 14, 13)>, <9, (2, 14, 0)>, <9, (2, 10, 13)>, <9, (2, 10, 0)>, <9, (2, 13, 0)>, <9, (14, 10, 13)>, <9, (14, 10, 0)>, <9, (14, 13, 0)>, <9, (10, 13, 0)>.

For nodes 4, 7, and 14:
- Nodes 4, 7, and 14 all have 5 neighbors and the number of 3-stars for each of them is 10.
- The unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center are <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 7, 3)>, ...
- The unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center are <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (10, 4, 3)>, ...
- The unique 3-stars with node 14 as the center are <14, (6, 9, 11)>, <14, (6, 10, 11)>, ...

Adding up all the calculated 3-stars gives us a total of [70] 3-stars in the graph.
