Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are some nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph, and we will check each of these nodes for the formation of 3-stars.

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- For node 0: There are 4 potential 3-stars.
- For node 1: There are 4 potential 3-stars.
- For node 3: There are 7 potential 3-stars.
- For node 4: There is 1 potential 3-star.
- For node 6: There is 1 potential 3-star.
- For node 8: There are 5 potential 3-stars.
- For node 9: There are 6 potential 3-stars.
- For node 10: There are 3 potential 3-stars.
- For node 11: There is 1 potential 3-star.
- For node 12: There are 5 potential 3-stars.
- For node 13: There are 6 potential 3-stars.
- For node 14: There are 3 potential 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\[ [4 + 4 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 3] = [40] \]

Therefore, there are 40 total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
