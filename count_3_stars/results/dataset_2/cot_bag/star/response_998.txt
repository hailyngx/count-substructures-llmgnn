Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 11, 2, 8, 14, 5, 13, 9, 6, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 91 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [91].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <4, (9, 13, 5)>, <7, (6, 2, 13)>, <1, (7, 6, 12)>, <10, (9, 14, 5)>, <11, (14, 9, 2)>, <2, (7, 11, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <14, (3, 10, 11)>, <5, (4, 7, 10)>, <13, (4, 7, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 11)>, <6, (4, 7, 13)>, and <12, (1, 2, 8)>.
