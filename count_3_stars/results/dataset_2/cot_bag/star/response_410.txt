Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph described, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Let us calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
