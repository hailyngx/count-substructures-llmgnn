Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 21) (5, 16) (9, 21) (9, 28) (1, 3) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 18) (7, 0) (7, 26) (7, 13) (7, 17) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 26) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 7) (17, 10) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 15) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 12) (29, 24) (0, 5) (0, 7) (22, 26) (22, 27) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 27) (27, 22) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 6) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 4) (19, 21) (19, 2) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 13) (6, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 6) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 28) (28, 9) (28, 20) (14, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 55 \]

So, there are \([55]\) 3-stars in total.
