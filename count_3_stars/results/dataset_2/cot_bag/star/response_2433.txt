Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: (4, 1), (7, 1), (1, 3), (1, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 1), (4, 11)
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 14)
- Node 7: (4, 7), (7, 14), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 1)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 12)
- Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 14), (9, 12)
- Node 12: (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 5), (12, 2)
- Node 14: (14, 7), (14, 10), (14, 9), (14, 5)

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 11, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 11)>
- <5, (12, 14, 8)>
- <7, (4, 1, 11)>
- <8, (2, 10, 5)>
- <9, (6, 1, 7)>
- <12, (2, 5, 8)>
- <14, (5, 10, 9)>
