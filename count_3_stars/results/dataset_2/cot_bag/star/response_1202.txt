Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 4) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 1) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (20, 22) (20, 13) (20, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (21, 13) (8, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 16) (4, 25) (12, 18) (12, 29) (28, 17) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 19) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 11) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 27) (7, 6) (7, 27) (27, 18) (27, 16) (27, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of $30$ nodes, but not all nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: neighbors 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: neighbors 6, 11, 17, 26
- Node 3: neighbors 6, 22, 24, 25, 29
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 16, 17, 23
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 2, 7, 16
- Node 9: neighbors 15, 26
- Node 11: neighbors 2, 19, 20, 22, 24
- Node 13: neighbors 15, 20, 21, 26
- Node 15: neighbors 9, 10, 13, 26
- Node 16: neighbors 1, 5, 6, 17, 27
- Node 17: neighbors 2, 16, 19, 23, 28
- Node 18: neighbors 0, 12, 27
- Node 19: neighbors 1, 11, 23
- Node 20: neighbors 11, 13, 22
- Node 22: neighbors 3, 11, 20
- Node 23: neighbors 5, 17, 19, 25
- Node 24: neighbors 3, 11, 14
- Node 25: neighbors 3, 4, 23, 26
- Node 26: neighbors 2, 8, 9, 13, 15, 25
- Node 27: neighbors 16, 18, 7
- Node 29: neighbors 0, 3, 12

From the list above, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29 have three or more neighbors, which means they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: $C(4, 3) = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 3: $C(5, 3) = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 6: $C(5, 3) = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 11: $C(5, 3) = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 13: $C(4, 3) = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 15: $C(4, 3) = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 16: $C(5, 3) = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 17: $C(5, 3) = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 19: $C(3, 3) = 1$ 3-star
- Node 20: $C(3, 3) = 1$ 3-star
- Node 22: $C(3, 3) = 1$ 3-star
- Node 23: $C(4, 3) = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 24: $C(3, 3) = 1$ 3-star
- Node 25: $C(4, 3) = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 26: $C(6, 3) = 20$ 3-stars
- Node 29: $C(3, 3) = 1$ 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get $4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 80$ 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[80]$, and the unique 3-stars are:
