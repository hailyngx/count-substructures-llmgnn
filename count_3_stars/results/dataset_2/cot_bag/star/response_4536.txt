Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 19) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 16) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 12) (29, 4) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 16) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 1) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 27) (22, 26) (22, 11) (23, 14) (23, 11) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 11) (20, 10) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 24) (24, 21) (24, 4) (24, 5) (4, 29) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 6) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (1, 8) (1, 13) (6, 27) (28, 18) (28, 25) (7, 29) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 17) (16, 7) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 11) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 10) (18, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 29) (12, 0)

<13, (7, 8, 29)>
<27, (4, 6, 13)>
<14, (4, 10, 23)>
<29, (2, 12, 4)>
<15, (3, 18, 20)>
<18, (5, 28, 10)>
<1, (8, 13, 21)>
<9, (3, 19, 15)>
<22, (11, 26, 23)>
