Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 8

Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the possible 3-stars together: \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
