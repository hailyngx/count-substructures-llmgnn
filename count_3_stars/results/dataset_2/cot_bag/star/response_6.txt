Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has degree 6
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

For node 0, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \).

So, the final answer is [52]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 1)>, <0, (3, 9, 8)> <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 0, 8)>.
