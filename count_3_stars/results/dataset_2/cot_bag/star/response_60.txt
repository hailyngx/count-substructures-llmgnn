Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 7) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 28) (20, 14) (20, 28) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 12) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 7) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (0, 22) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 29) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 28) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 29) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 27) (6, 14) (6, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (4, 1) (4, 21) (4, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 19) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 19) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 10) (24, 4) (24, 28) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 24) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges is provided. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:  
- Node 2 with 5 neighbors (22, 8, 1, 16, 21)
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors (25, 26, 0, 29, 28)
- Node 14 with 4 neighbors (23, 20, 6, 12)
- Node 15 with 5 neighbors (8, 26, 17, 0, 5)
- Node 22 with 3 neighbors (23, 2, 0)
- Node 23 with 4 neighbors (22, 8, 14, 28)
- Node 26 with 5 neighbors (1, 15, 11, 27, 7)
- Node 28 with 5 neighbors (23, 20, 7, 10, 24)
- Node 29 with 3 neighbors (0, 7, 19)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing all 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (22, 8, 1)>
<2, (22, 8, 16)>
<2, (22, 8, 21)>
<2, (22, 1, 16)>
<2, (22, 1, 21)>
<2, (22, 16, 21)>
<7, (25, 26, 0)>
<7, (25, 26, 29)>
<7, (25, 0, 29)>
<7, (26, 0, 29)>
<7, (26, 0, 28)>
<14, (23, 20, 6)>
<15, (8, 26, 17)>
<15, (8, 26, 5)>
<15, (8, 17, 5)>
<15, (26, 17, 5)>
<26, (1, 15, 11)>
<26, (1, 15, 27)>
<26, (1, 11, 27)>
<26, (15, 11, 27)>
<28, (23, 20, 24)>

The total number of unique 3-stars is 20. [54]
