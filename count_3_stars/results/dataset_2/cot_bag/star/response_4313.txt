Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 76

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
