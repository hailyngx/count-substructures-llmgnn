Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 17) (16, 29) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 13) (10, 9) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 21) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 28) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 9) (4, 13) (27, 10) (27, 29) (27, 13) (1, 20) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 22) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (26, 29) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 13) (22, 20) (22, 15) (22, 14) (22, 17) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 26) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (24, 23) (24, 0) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 14) (6, 18) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 10, 20, 21, 28, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (11, 13, 27)>, <10, (11, 9, 25)>, <10, (13, 27, 9)>, <10, (13, 4, 9)>

- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <20, (3, 22, 28)>, <20, (3, 28, 19)>, <20, (3, 9, 25)>, <20, (3, 1, 9)>, <20, (22, 28, 15)>, <20, (22, 15, 14)>, <20, (22, 15, 17)>, <20, (22, 17, 11)>, <20, (15, 17, 11)>, <20, (19, 14, 22)>

- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <21, (11, 12, 28)>, <21, (11, 28, 15)>, <21, (12, 28, 15)>, <21, (28, 15, 22)>

- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <28, (3, 19, 15)>, <28, (3, 19, 14)>, <28, (3, 15, 22)>, <28, (3, 22, 17)>, <28, (19, 15, 14)>, <28, (19, 14, 22)>, <28, (19, 14, 13)>, <28, (19, 22, 17)>, <28, (15, 22, 17)>, <28, (22, 17, 11)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <9, (1, 4, 25)>, <9, (1, 4, 13)>, <9, (1, 13, 27)>, <9, (1, 27, 10)>, <9, (4, 13, 27)>, <9, (4, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 27, 10)>, <9, (13, 27, 10)>, <9, (13, 27, 14)>, <9, (27, 10, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final result is [38].
