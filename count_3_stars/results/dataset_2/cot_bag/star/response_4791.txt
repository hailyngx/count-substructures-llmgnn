Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
We will first construct the graph based on the given information, with the nodes labeled from 0 to 14. Then we will find the total number of 3-stars and list them as requested.

The graph consists of the following nodes and their connections:

```
Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 10), 
(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 12), 
(1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 4), 
(3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 6), 
(6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 0), (6, 13), 
(0, 6), (0, 14), (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), 
(14, 3), (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 4), (14, 13), 
(8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 0), 
(4, 1), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 12), (4, 10), 
(12, 5), (12, 9), (12, 4), 
(7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 14), (7, 11), 
(11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 7), (11, 2), 
(2, 0), (2, 11), (2, 10), 
(13, 6), (13, 14), 
(10, 5), (10, 4), (10, 2)
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars and list them:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <0, (6, 8, 14)>, <0, (4, 8, 14)>
  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <1, (9, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star:
  <3, (1, 6, 14)>
  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <4, (1, 10, 12)>, <4, (0, 10, 14)>
  
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (8, 10, 12)>
  
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <6, (5, 3, 13)>, <6, (0, 7, 13)>
  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <7, (9, 11, 14)>
  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <9, (5, 1, 12)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>
  
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <11, (1, 2, 7)>
  
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include:
  <14, (3, 0, 13)>, <14, (4, 7, 13)>
  
The total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [73] \).
