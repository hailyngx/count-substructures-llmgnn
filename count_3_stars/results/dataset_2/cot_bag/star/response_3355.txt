Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (14, 18) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 11) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's identify the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 10, 8, 7, 5
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 10, 8)>, <3, (6, 10, 7)>, <3, (6, 10, 5)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 7, 5)>, <3, (10, 8, 7)>, <3, (10, 8, 5)>, <3, (10, 7, 5)>, <3, (8, 7, 5)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 1, 15
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (11, 13, 1)>, <4, (11, 13, 15)>, <4, (11, 1, 15)>, <4, (13, 1, 15)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 19, 1, 17, 3
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (19, 1, 17)>, <5, (19, 1, 3)>, <5, (19, 17, 3)>, <5, (1, 17, 3)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 12, 16
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 3, 12)>, <6, (9, 3, 16)>, <6, (9, 12, 16)>, <6, (3, 12, 16)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 8, 4, 1, 19
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <13, (8, 4, 1)>, <13, (8, 4, 19)>, <13, (8, 1, 19)>, <13, (4, 1, 19)>

For node 15:
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 2, 18, 12, 16, 4
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <15, (2, 18, 12)>, <15, (2, 18, 16)>, <15, (2, 18, 4)>, <15, (2, 12, 16)>, <15, (2, 12, 4)>, <15, (2, 16, 4)>, <15, (18, 12, 16)>, <15, (18, 12, 4)>, <15, (18, 16, 4)>, <15, (12, 16, 4)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get:
\[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [36] \]
Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 36.
