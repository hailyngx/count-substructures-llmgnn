Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three neighbors, so let's find the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 11.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 16.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 12.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 10.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 19.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \)

So, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<11, (1, 3, 4)>
<16, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (1, 10, 18)>
<12, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (12, 16, 19)>
<10, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 10, 15)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<19, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (11, 17, 18)>
