Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 5, 7, 3, and 4
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 2, 13, and 0
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 7, 5, and 8
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 13, 4, 10, and 0
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 5, and 14
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 1, 8, 11, 12, and 2
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 8, and 7
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 12, 0, and 2
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, and 13
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, and 7
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 13, and 12
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 10, 7, and 14
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 10, and 7
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 11, 2, and 10
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 1, and 10

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For nodes 6, 9, 3, 8, 10, 4, 7, 2, and 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node.
- For node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 5, 0, 12, and 14, there are no 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- For node 11, there is 1 3-star.
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10*9 + 4 + 1 = 95 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [95]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 7, 4)>
<9, (6, 3, 13)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 10, 0)>
<10, (1, 12, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<7, (6, 12, 2)>
<2, (9, 10, 7)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<13, (9, 8, 5)>
<11, (1, 10, 2)>
