Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}. It can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 1: Has 6 neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. It can form \( C(6,3) = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: Has 2 neighbors {0, 4}. Cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}. It can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 4: Has 4 neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors {1, 6, 8}. It can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors {1, 5, 8}. It can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors {3, 4, 9}. It can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 8: Has 5 neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}. It can form \( C(5,3) = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: Has 4 neighbors {0, 7, 8, 1}. It can form 1 3-star. 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[ [ 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 ] = [38] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 38.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 0, 7)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
