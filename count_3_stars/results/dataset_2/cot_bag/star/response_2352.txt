Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 23) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 7) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 3) (20, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (19, 26) (19, 15) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 4) (28, 12) (28, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (21, 15) (21, 4) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 24) (7, 2) (7, 17) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 22) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 2) (1, 27) (1, 18) (16, 26) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 29) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 17) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 12) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 17) (13, 9) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 23) (10, 27) (12, 6) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 29) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees higher than 3 are: 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, and 29. 

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For example, Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Here are the calculations for the other nodes:
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 15: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 17: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 20: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 21: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 22: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 23: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 25: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 26: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 27: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 29: 4 choose 3 = 4

Summing these up: \(10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (21, 11, 23)> 
<3, (21, 11, 14)> 
<3, (21, 15, 17)> 
<3, (21, 15, 19)> 
<3, (21, 15, 4)> 
<3, (21, 4, 11)> 
<3, (21, 4, 14)> 
<3, (21, 4, 17)> 
<3, (21, 7, 5)> 
<3, (23, 10, 27)> 
<4, (17, 6, 7)> 
<4, (17, 6, 15)> 
<4, (17, 7, 5)> 
<4, (17, 7, 15)>
