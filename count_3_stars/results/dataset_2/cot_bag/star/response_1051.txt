Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 14, 7, 15, 18
- Node 1: 3, 16
- Node 2: 17, 19, 6
- Node 3: 1, 17, 4
- Node 4: 3, 11, 9, 5
- Node 5: 14, 7, 15, 4
- Node 6: 15, 2
- Node 7: 17, 0, 5
- Node 8: 13, 9, 12, 18
- Node 9: 8, 4, 19
- Node 10: 11, 17, 15
- Node 11: 10, 4, 12, 3
- Node 12: 11, 8
- Node 13: 8
- Node 14: 0, 5
- Node 15: 10, 0, 6, 5, 16
- Node 16: 1, 15
- Node 17: 3, 10, 2, 7
- Node 18: 8, 0, 19
- Node 19: 9, 18, 2

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star because it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star because it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 15>
<3, 1, 17>
<4, 3, 11>
<5, 0, 14>
<8, 9, 19>
<9, 4, 11>
<10, 11, 17>
<15, 0, 6>
<17, 7, 2>
<18, 0, 19>
<19, 2, 6>
