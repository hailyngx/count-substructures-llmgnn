Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (15, 13) (15, 11) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, there are 36 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely, we get:
[<1, (3, 4, 0)>, <3, (1, 11, 12)>, <4, (1, 0, 14)>, <5, (9, 13, 7)>, <7, (5, 2, 12)>, <9, (5, 16, 1)>, <11, (3, 13, 19)>, <13, (5, 11, 17)>, <16, (9, 3, 19)>, <17, (2, 18, 6)>, <18, (8, 0, 17)>, <19, (7, 11, 16)>]
