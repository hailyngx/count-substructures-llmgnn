Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- It has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 10, 11, 2.
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 4, 10)>, <0, (5, 4, 11)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 10, 11)>, <0, (5, 10, 2)>, <0, (5, 11, 2)>, <0, (4, 10, 11)>, <0, (4, 10, 2)>, <0, (4, 11, 2)>, <0, (10, 11, 2)>

For node 1:
- It has 5 neighbors: 5, 3, 14, 10, 8.
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 3, 14)>, <1, (5, 3, 10)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 14, 10)>, <1, (5, 14, 8)>, <1, (5, 10, 8)>, <1, (3, 14, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 8)>, <1, (3, 10, 8)>, <1, (14, 10, 8)>

For node 2:
- It has 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 14, 0.
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (8, 13, 14)>, <2, (8, 13, 0)>, <2, (8, 14, 0)>, <2, (13, 14, 0)>

For node 4, 5, 7, 9, and 14:
- Each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes gives: \[10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29\]

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
