Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: 1
- Node 13: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 63
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 13)>, <0, (5, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 13)>, <1, (10, 4, 14)>, <2, (4, 6, 14)>, <2, (4, 8, 14)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 13)>, <3, (5, 8, 13)>, <3, (8, 13, 6)>, <3, (8, 13, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 11)>
