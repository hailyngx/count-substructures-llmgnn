Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 29, 11
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 19, 22, 16, 7
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 9, 21, 1
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 7, 16, 2
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 20, 17, 10, 11, 16
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 8, 26, 17, 13
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 19, 26, 16, 3, 18
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 23, 26, 5, 27
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 13, 16
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 9, 21, 5, 28, 17
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 25, 23, 16, 3
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 13, 22, 24, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- From node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 7: 1 3-star
- From node 21: 1 3-star
- From node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- From node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- From node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58 \)

Therefore, there are 58 total 3-stars in the given graph.
