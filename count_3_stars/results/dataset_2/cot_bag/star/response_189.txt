Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 1 -- 5
|    |    |    |
4    6 -- 2    9
|    |    |    |
|    8    7    |
 --------|-----
        0
```

Based on the information provided, we see that Node 6 is the only node with exactly 3 neighbors, thus forming a 3-star. Let's find the unique 3-star:

Total number of 3-stars = [1]

Unique 3-star: <<6, (1, 2, 4)>>
