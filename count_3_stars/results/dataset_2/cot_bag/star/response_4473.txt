Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51 \]

Therefore, there are 51 3-stars in total. Let's list them in the < > format:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<3, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (9, 0, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 0, 5)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 3)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
