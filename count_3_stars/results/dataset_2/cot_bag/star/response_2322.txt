Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 2) (27, 3) (7, 21) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 0) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 11) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 0) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 18) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 22) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 24) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 18) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 21) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (23, 10) (23, 19) (8, 7) (8, 20) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 14) (4, 16) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 23) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 2) (3, 27) (3, 20) (22, 15) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18, and 20.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28

So, there are a total of 28 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<[0, 17, 26], [0, 2, 19], [0, 25, 13], [0, 25, 20], [2, 0, 19], [5, 13, 24], [6, 12, 28], [6, 22, 12], [7, 14, 12], [7, 14, 21], [7, 14, 26], [7, 21, 9], [12, 14, 7], [12, 14, 28], [12, 15, 28], [12, 28, 6], [13, 24, 5], [17, 11, 18], [17, 11, 20], [17, 26, 1], [18, 11, 20], [18, 29, 24], [20, 11, 17], [20, 25, 13], [20, 25, 0], [21, 7, 14], [22, 1, 26], [22, 5, 13], [22, 5, 28]> 

Putting the final number inside brackets []: [28]
