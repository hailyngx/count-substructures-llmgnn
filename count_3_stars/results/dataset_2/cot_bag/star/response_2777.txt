Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (11, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 18) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's now identify the 3-star formations:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 8, 13, 14. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 4: <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 15, 0. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 8: <8, (4, 15, 0)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 17. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 5: <5, (6, 1, 17)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 1, 14. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 6: <6, (5, 1, 14)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 10, 12, 1. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 2: <2, (10, 12, 1)>
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 15, 14. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 7: <7, (3, 15, 14)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 2. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 1: <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 16: <16, (17, 13, 15)>, <16, (17, 3, 15)>, <16, (17, 3, 18)>, <16, (13, 15, 19)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 14: <14, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 17, 3, 13. So, 1 3-star is formed with node 18: <18, (17, 3, 13)>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 15: <15, (8, 16, 19)>, <15, (7, 16, 19)>, <15, (16, 3, 18)>, <15, (19, 16, 13)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, there are 4 3-stars formed with node 19: <19, (11, 9, 15)>, <19, (15, 16, 13)>, <19, (9, 15, 13)>, <19, (15, 13, 18)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, which is more than 3. So, there are 10 3-stars formed with node 3: <3, (7, 16, 15)>, <3, (7, 12, 18)>, <3, (7, 13, 18)>, <3, (7, 15, 19)>, <3, (16, 13, 18)>, <3, (16, 15, 19)>, <3, (13, 18, 15)>, <3, (13, 19, 15)>, <3, (18, 15, 19)>, <3, (13, 18, 16)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a final count of [26].
