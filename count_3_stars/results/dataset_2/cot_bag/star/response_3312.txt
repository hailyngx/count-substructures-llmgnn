Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 25) (16, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 8) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 6) (8, 11) (8, 20) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 1) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (29, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 21) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 1) (0, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 15) (21, 16) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 15) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 3) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 26) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 21) (13, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 10) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 6) (6, 23) (6, 2) (6, 26) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 27) (1, 18) (10, 3) (10, 14) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 5) (5, 16) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 24) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars and list them.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
17. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
18. Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
19. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
20. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
21. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
22. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
23. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
24. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all these 3-stars, we get a total of 80 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [80].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 18, 27)>, <2, (6, 12, 22)>, <3, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (16, 24, 25)>, <8, (11, 20, 28)>, 
<11, (8, 12, 28)>, <12, (11, 17, 27)>, <13, (3, 21, 28)>, <14, (3, 9, 24)>, <15, (19, 21, 26)>, 
<16, (5, 20, 25)>, <17, (12, 18, 21)>, <18, (0, 1, 17)>, <19, (15, 21, 25)>, <20, (1, 25, 26)>, 
<21, (17, 15, 16)>, <22, (1, 19, 22)>, <24, (4, 14, 24)>, <25, (5, 19, 25)>, <26, (6, 15, 26)>, 
<28, (8, 11, 13)>.
