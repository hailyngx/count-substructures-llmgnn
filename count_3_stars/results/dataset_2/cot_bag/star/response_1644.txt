Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 2) (5, 19) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (12, 7) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:


For node 0, there are 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 18. So, there's 1 3-star. 

For node 3, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 0, 17, and 2. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (1, 0, 17)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (1, 17, 2)>, <3, (0, 17, 2)>.

For node 4, there are 3 neighbors: 7, 9, and 16. So, there's 1 3-star.

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 12, 10, 18, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (4, 12, 10)>, <7, (4, 12, 18)>, <7, (4, 12, 17)>, <7, (4, 10, 18)>, <7, (4, 10, 17)>, <7, (4, 18, 17)>, <7, (12, 10, 18)>, <7, (12, 10, 17)>, <7, (12, 18, 17)>, <7, (10, 18, 17)>.

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 2, 9, 10, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 17)>, <8, (2, 10, 17)>, <8, (9, 10, 17)>.

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 12, and 11. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (4, 8, 12)>, <9, (4, 8, 11)>, <9, (4, 12, 11)>, <9, (8, 12, 11)>.

For node 10, there are 3 neighbors: 7, 1, and 8. So, there's 1 3-star.

For node 11, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 13, 19, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (6, 13, 19)>, <11, (6, 13, 9)>, <11, (6, 19, 9)>, <11, (13, 19, 9)>.

For node 14, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 18, 16, and 13. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <14, (6, 18, 16)>, <14, (6, 18, 13)>, <14, (6, 16, 13)>, <14, (18, 16, 13)>.

For node 16, there are 3 neighbors: 4, 14, and 2. So, there's 1 3-star. 

For node 17, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 3, 8, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <17, (7, 3, 8)>, <17, (7, 3, 17)>, <17, (7, 8, 17)>, <17, (3, 8, 17)>.

For node 18, there are 3 neighbors: 7, 0, and 14. So, there's 1 3-star. 

For node 19, there are 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 11, and 19. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <19, (5, 6, 11)>, <19, (5, 6, 9)>, <19, (5, 11, 9)>, <19, (6, 11, 9)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [42] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 42.
