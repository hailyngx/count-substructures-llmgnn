Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 26) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (4, 24) (4, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 28) (15, 11) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 21) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 23) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 20) (7, 16) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 21) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 29) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 3) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 19) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 25) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 2) (6, 11) (6, 2) (14, 28) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 24) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 29 has 1 neighbor

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 60 

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 9, 21>, <2, 10, 26>, <3, 20, 28>, <4, 24, 5>, <8, 13, 26>, <8, 16, 20>, <8, 17, 10>, <15, 10, 11>, <18, 22, 5>, <19, 1, 12>
