Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (5, 8, 2)
- Node 1: (4, 7, 3, 8)
- Node 2: (9, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 3: (9, 1, 8)
- Node 4: (9, 7, 8, 6, 1)
- Node 5: (9, 8, 7, 0)
- Node 6: (4, 7)
- Node 7: (5, 4, 1, 6, 2)
- Node 8: (5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 0)
- Node 9: (5, 4, 2, 3)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 60

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
