Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars formed. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (with neighbors 9, 3, 2, 8)
- Node 2 (with neighbors 1, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 3 (with neighbors 6, 1, 7, 2)
- Node 5 (with neighbors 9, 8, 7)
- Node 7 (with neighbors 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 2, 8)
- Node 8 (with neighbors 5, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 35 = 83

Therefore, the final answer is [83].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 4)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 4)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 3, 4)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 6)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 3, 9)>, <7, (5, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 5)>, <7, (2, 8, 5)>, <7, (9, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>, <7, (2, 8, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>,
