Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {4, 7, 2}
- 1: {7, 6, 8}
- 2: {9, 4, 8, 3, 0}
- 3: {9, 4, 7, 6, 2}
- 4: {5, 2, 0, 3}
- 5: {9, 6, 8, 4}
- 6: {5, 1, 3, 8}
- 7: {0, 3, 1, 8}
- 8: {5, 7, 6, 2, 1}
- 9: {5, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

So, the final number of 3-stars is [25].

Unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 4)>
