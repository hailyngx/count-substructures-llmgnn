Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 12) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 2) (0, 22) (2, 0) (2, 27) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 11) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 20) (25, 15) (25, 28) (25, 14) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 11) (12, 26) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 24) (19, 22) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 25) (29, 12) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 10) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 4) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 20) (20, 22) (20, 7) (20, 5) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 5) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 5) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 17) (27, 28) (28, 25) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 27) (14, 13) (14, 25) (14, 12) (14, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4*13 = 1 + 52 = 53

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (9, 17, 1)>
- <4, (22, 20, 4)>
- <5, (8, 24, 5)>
- <7, (13, 7, 29)>
- <10, (5, 23, 10)>
- <12, (29, 14, 12)>
- <14, (23, 25, 14)>
- <15, (17, 25, 15)>
- <16, (6, 21, 16)>
- <17, (1, 15, 17)>
- <19, (24, 22, 19)>
- <20, (7, 5, 20)>
- <22, (0, 19, 22)>
- <24, (26, 5, 24)>
- <25, (14, 28, 25)>
- <26, (27, 24, 26)>
- <27, (2, 17, 27)>
- <28, (4, 27, 28)>
- <29, (18, 10, 29)>
