Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: 1, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1 (1, 12, 15, 18):
- There are three possible 3-stars: <1, (12, 18, 15)>, <1, (12, 15, 7)>, <1, (18, 15, 7)>.

For node 4 (2, 4, 6, 9):
- There are three possible 3-stars: <4, (2, 9, 18)>, <4, (2, 6, 14)>, <4, (9, 18, 12)>.

For node 9 (2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 18):
- There are six possible 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 18)>, <9, (2, 4, 12)>, <9, (2, 12, 18)>, <9, (3, 4, 18)>, <9, (3, 12, 18)>, <9, (4, 12, 18)>.

For node 11 (2, 10, 11, 12, 17):
- There are four possible 3-stars: <11, (2, 10, 17)>, <11, (2, 12, 17)>, <11, (10, 12, 17)>, <11, (10, 11, 12)>.

For node 12 (1, 9, 11, 12, 17):
- There are four possible 3-stars: <12, (1, 11, 17)>, <12, (1, 12, 17)>, <12, (9, 11, 17)>, <12, (9, 12, 17)>.

For node 13 (7, 8, 10, 13, 16):
- There are four possible 3-stars: <13, (7, 10, 16)>, <13, (7, 13, 16)>, <13, (8, 10, 16)>, <13, (8, 13, 16)>.

For node 15 (1, 17, 19):
- There is one possible 3-star: <15, (1, 17, 19)>.

For node 16 (7, 13, 14, 16):
- There is one possible 3-star: <16, (7, 13, 14)>.

For node 17 (11, 12, 15, 17, 18):
- There are six possible 3-stars: <17, (11, 12, 18)>, <17, (11, 12, 17)>, <17, (11, 15, 18)>, <17, (11, 15, 17)>, <17, (12, 15, 18)>, <17, (12, 15, 17)>.

For node 19 (0, 5, 15, 19):
- There is one possible 3-star: <19, (0, 5, 15)>.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we have a total of 3 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 33 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars found in this graph is [33].
