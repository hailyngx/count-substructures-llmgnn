Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 3, 7, 12, 11, 2, 10
- Node 1: 11, 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 0, 11
- Node 3: 0, 12
- Node 4: 9, 13, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 10, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 12, 0, 11, 2
- Node 8: 5, 6, 13, 10, 12
- Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 10
- Node 10: 5, 9, 8, 13, 0, 14
- Node 11: 1, 7, 12, 2
- Node 12: 3, 8, 7, 0, 11
- Node 13: 8, 4, 10
- Node 14: 10

Nodes 5, 9, and 10 each have exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star each. So far, we have 3 3-stars. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives us 60 additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3 + 60 = 63.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, 6, 8>
<9, 6, 8>
<10, 8, 13>
<0, 7, 12>
<0, 10, 14>
<0, 2, 11>
<7, 11, 12>
<2, 7, 11>
