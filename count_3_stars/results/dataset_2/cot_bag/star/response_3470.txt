Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 9) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 6, node 9, and node 11. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 6:
   - Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 10, 11, 8, 0
   - Number of 3-stars with node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

2. Node 9:
   - Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 10, 3, 7
   - Number of 3-stars with node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

3. Node 11:
   - Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 6, 1, 10, 0, 5, 12
   - Number of 3-stars with node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \)

Thus, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 4, 10)>
<11, (6, 1, 10)>
<6, (1, 11, 0)>
<11, (1, 10, 0)>
