Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 5) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (18, 15) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 12) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 16) (10, 14) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 11, 17)>, <3, (0, 5, 19)>, <5, (3, 16, 19)>, <7, (0, 11, 17)>, <9, (6, 14, 15)>, <11, (0, 7, 19)>, <12, (6, 14, 17)>, <13, (4, 6, 16)>, <14, (9, 12, 10)>, <15, (9, 14, 18)>, <16, (10, 13, 5)>, <17, (1, 12, 11)>, <19, (4, 15, 3)>
