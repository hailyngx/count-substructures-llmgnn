Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with neighbors 14, 3, 11, 1, and 13
- Node 3 with neighbors 7, 0, 8, 9, and 5
- Node 6 with neighbors 7, 12, 8, 11
- Node 9 with neighbors 12, 14, 4, 11, 3
- Node 10 with neighbors 7, 2, 4, 1, and 13
- Node 11 with neighbors 7, 0, 14, 8, 9, and 6
- Node 13 with neighbors 0, 14, 2, 4, and 10

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 74 \)

So, there are 74 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [74].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (14, 3, 11)>
- <0, (14, 3, 1)>
- <0, (14, 3, 13)>
- <0, (14, 11, 1)>
- <0, (14, 11, 13)>
- <0, (3, 11, 1)>
- <0, (3, 11, 13)>
- <0, (11, 1, 13)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 11)>
- <6, (7, 11, 8)>
- <9, (12, 4, 11)>
- <9, (12, 4, 3)>
- <9, (14, 4, 11)>
- <9, (14, 4, 3)>
- <10, (7, 4, 13)>
- <10, (7, 1, 13)>
- <11, (7, 9, 6)>
- <11, (7, 6, 9)>
- <11, (0, 8, 6)>
- <11, (0, 8, 9)>
- <11, (0, 6, 9)>
- <11, (8, 9, 6)>
- <13, (0, 2, 4)>
- <13, (0, 2, 10)>
- <13, (14, 2, 10)>
- <13, (2, 4, 10)>
- <13, (2, 10, 4)>
