Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: 6, 10, 11, 2, and 5. So it can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- For node 2, there are 5 neighbors: 11, 13, 0, 3, and 1. So it can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- For node 3, there are 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 2, and 12. So it can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- For node 4, there are 3 neighbors: 8, 14, and 0. It can form only 1 3-star.

- For node 5, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 12, 1, and 7. So it can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- For node 6, there are 3 neighbors: 9, 1, and 13. It can form only 1 3-star.

- For node 7, there are 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 14, and 5. So it can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- For node 8, there are 5 neighbors: 13, 4, 14, 3, and 7. So it can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 11, 12, 1, 14, and 4. So it can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 1, 2, and 6. So it can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 10, 13, 3, and 5. So it can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 6, 8, 12, 2, 3, and 7. So it can form \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

- Node 14 has 6 neighbors: 10, 8, 4, 0, 7, and 3. So it can form \( {6 \choose 3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get:

\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 94 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (6, 10, 11)>
<2, (11, 0, 3)>
<3, (13, 8, 12)>
<4, (8, 0, 14)>
<5, (0, 12, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 13)>
<7, (8, 13, 14)>
<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<9, (6, 11, 1)>
<10, (11, 1, 2)>
<11, (10, 1, 14)>
<12, (10, 13, 5)>
<13, (12, 3, 5)>
<14, (14, 0, 7)>
