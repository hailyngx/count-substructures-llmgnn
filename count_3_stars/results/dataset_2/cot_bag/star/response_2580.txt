Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 14, 3
- Node 1 has neighbors: 11, 7, 12, 14, 4
- Node 2 has neighbors: 13, 14
- Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 9, 12, 0, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 10, 11, 13, 12, 1
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 6, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 11, 13, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 10, 8, 1, 12
- Node 8 has neighbors: 9, 14, 7
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 11, 3
- Node 10 has neighbors: 12, 7, 4
- Node 11 has neighbors: 9, 14, 1, 6, 4
- Node 12 has neighbors: 10, 3, 4, 1
- Node 13 has neighbors: 2, 14, 6, 4
- Node 14 has neighbors: 11, 8, 13, 2, 0, 1

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (11, 4, 14)>, <3, (5, 9, 12)>, <4, (1, 11, 13)>, <6, (5, 11, 13)>, <7, (10, 12, 1)>, <9, (5, 11, 3)>, <11, (1, 4, 14)>, <12, (1, 4, 10)>, <13, (2,  4, 14)>, <14, (1, 4, 11)>
