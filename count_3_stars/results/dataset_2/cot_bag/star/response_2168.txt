Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 18) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 2) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 10) (3, 23) (3, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (12, 7) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 18) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 25) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 23) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 22) (20, 1) (20, 2) (20, 29) (4, 3) (4, 0) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 13) (22, 15) (22, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 9) (23, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 4) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 11, 16, 1, 21, 2, 29, 7, 3, 26, 12, 19, 8, 13, and 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 28: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<11, (5, 15, 16)>, 
<16, (11, 18, 28)>, 
<1, (20, 21, 27)>, 
<21, (10, 13, 21)>, 
<2, (8, 14, 29)>, 
<29, (2, 20, 16)>, 
<26, (13, 19, 26)>, 
<19, (18, 17, 26)>, 
<8, (2, 28, 9)>, 
<13, (18, 21, 26)>, 
<28, (8, 14, 16)>.
