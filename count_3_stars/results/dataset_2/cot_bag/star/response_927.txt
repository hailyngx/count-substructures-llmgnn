Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 2)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- <0, (5, 7, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 8, 5)>
- <4, (2, 8, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 1)>
- <7, (6, 8, 1)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
