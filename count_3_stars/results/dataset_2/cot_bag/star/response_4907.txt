Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Nodes with their neighbors:
0: {5, 4, 8, 7}
1: {9, 6, 8, 7}
2: {9, 3, 7}
3: {5, 6, 2, 8}
4: {9, 0}
5: {9, 6, 0, 3}
6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8}
7: {1, 8, 0, 2}
8: {6, 1, 3, 0, 7}
9: {5, 6, 4, 2, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 forms inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Unique 3-stars:
