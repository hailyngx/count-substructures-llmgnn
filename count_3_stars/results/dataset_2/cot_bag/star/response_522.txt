Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-star graphs:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors
Node 1: has 5 neighbors
Node 2: has 4 neighbors
Node 3: has 4 neighbors
Node 4: has 2 neighbors
Node 5: has 4 neighbors
Node 6: has 3 neighbors
Node 7: has 4 neighbors
Node 8: has 5 neighbors
Node 9: has 4 neighbors

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-star graphs it can form:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 0, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>.
