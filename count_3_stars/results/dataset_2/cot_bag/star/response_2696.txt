Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 44 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
