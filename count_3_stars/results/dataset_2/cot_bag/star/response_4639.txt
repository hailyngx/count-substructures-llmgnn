Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 14: {7, 9}

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 73

So there are 73 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 7, 12)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 11)>, <4, (3, 9, 13)>, <5, (2, 9, 12)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <12, (0, 5, 8)>, <13, (1, 3, 11)>
