Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \([20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 52\).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 10, 14)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 10)>
- <5, (4, 8, 12)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <10, (0, 6, 1)>
