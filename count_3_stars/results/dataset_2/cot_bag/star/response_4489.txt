Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 3) (26, 17) (15, 23) (15, 2) (15, 25) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 5) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 1) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 19) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 1) (3, 26) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 26) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 5) (1, 23) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 14) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 22) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 24) (16, 13) (16, 22) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 16) (14, 10) (14, 24) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 7) (19, 25) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 4 neighbors, they are: 2, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 24.
Applying \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives us:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 28 \).
There are 28 unique 3-stars formed by these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [28]. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 15, 29)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<12, (10, 17, 24)>
<13, (11, 16, 24)>
<15, (2, 23, 25)>
<18, (1, 4, 9)>
<19, (7, 9, 25)>
<24, (12, 14, 29)>
