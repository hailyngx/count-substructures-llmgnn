Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. The total number of 3-stars is equal to the sum of combinations \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors.

Let's examine each node individually to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (4, 10, 9, 14), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (10, 8, 5, 3, 14, 0), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors (7, 9, 5, 14, 1, 11, 1), so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 2, 6, 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (7, 13, 12, 5), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (4, 12, 0, 3, 6, 1), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (10, 13, 2, 12), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (4, 11, 13, 1, 14), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (11, 8, 1, 2), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (4, 10, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (8, 9, 14, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors (4, 2, 1, 9, 13, 1), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 127 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 127. 

In brackets: [127]
And the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 10, 9)>
<2, (10, 8, 14)>
<4, (7, 5, 14)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (7, 13, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<10, (11, 8, 2)>
<11, (4, 13, 9)>
<14, (2, 1, 9)>
