Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (0, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 11) (20, 29) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 28) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 21) (26, 14) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 15) (9, 29) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 10) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 13) (28, 2) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 4) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 17) (1, 25) (1, 18) (22, 14) (22, 28) (22, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 22) (4, 3) (4, 17) (11, 25) (11, 12) (23, 27) 

Response:
The graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(15, 27), (15, 16), (15, 9), (15, 29), (15, 2), (27, 12), (27, 23), (0, 2), (3, 10), (3, 4), (25, 1), (25, 21), (25, 11), (8, 13), (8, 24), (8, 7), (13, 28), (12, 10), (12, 24), (12, 11), (20, 29), (5, 6), (5, 18), (5, 16), (5, 14), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 28), (21, 19), (21, 26), (18, 1), (26, 14), (29, 20), (9, 29), (14, 22), (16, 17), (28, 22), (17, 4), (24, 17), (22, 10)}

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors  
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors  
- Node 8 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 14 with 5 neighbors  
- Node 15 with 5 neighbors  
- Node 16 with 4 neighbors  
- Node 19 with 5 neighbors  
- Node 21 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 22 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 24 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 25 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 27 with 3 neighbors  
- Node 28 with 5 neighbors  
- Node 29 with 4 neighbors  

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes and sum up the results.  

Calculating for each node:  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Summing up:  
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<2, (0, 7, 28)>  
<5, (6, 18, 16)>  
<14, (22, 28, 19)>  
<15, (27, 9, 29)>  
<16, (5, 28, 17)>  
<19, (18, 29, 14)>  
<28, (13, 2, 22)>
