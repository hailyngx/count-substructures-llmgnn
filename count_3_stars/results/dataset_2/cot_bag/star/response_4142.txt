Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 25) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 5) (20, 17) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 18) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 22) (28, 5) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 10) (26, 8) (17, 20) (17, 13) (1, 13) (1, 22) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (23, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 22) (21, 19) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 29) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 29) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 12) (22, 1) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 29) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 8) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 5, 9, 16, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 16: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 24: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 26: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 27: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 29: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up this gives: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 33

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 20, 28)>, <9, (5, 14, 22)>, <16, (2, 15, 27)>, <22, (12, 21, 14)>, <24, (8, 29, 10)>, <26, (8, 10, 29)>.

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
