Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 13)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9, 19)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 11, 16)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 4, 19)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 10, 13, 15)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 16, 17, 18)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 7, 14, 18)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 5, 9, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 1, 10, 12)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 7, 19, 15)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 17)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 5, 8, 10, 11, 17)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 2, 8, 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 3, 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For nodes 6, 7, 10, 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 11, 16)>
<6, (0, 4, 19)>
<7, (10, 13, 15)>
<10, (7, 14, 18)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 11, 16)>, <6, (0, 4, 19)>, <7, (10, 13, 15)>, <10, (7, 14, 18)>.
