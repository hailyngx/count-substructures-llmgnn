Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 24) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 29) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 14) (22, 14) (22, 10) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 12) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 28) (11, 21) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (10, 15) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 13) (29, 3) (29, 20) (29, 25) (13, 10) (13, 4) (17, 25) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (4, 23) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 24) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (27, 2) (27, 16) (8, 6) (16, 6) (16, 27) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 26, 14, 24, 12
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 9, 5, 10
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 15, 23, 25, 4, 27
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 28, 29, 10
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 23, 13, 2, 24
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 12, 1, 24
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 15, 22, 28, 1, 13
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 21, 20, 28, 18
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 5, 0, 14, 24
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 21, 22, 0, 12
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 26, 3, 10, 2, 15
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 6, 27, 16
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 26, 21, 25, 28
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 19, 23, 11, 14
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 5, 0, 4, 12
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 17, 19, 29, 2
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 15, 19, 0
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 3, 19, 11, 18, 10
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 20, 25, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we have:

\[ [4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [70] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 70. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (26, 14, 24)> <0, (26, 14, 12)> <0, (26, 24, 12)> <1, (9, 5, 10)> <2, (15, 23, 25)> <2, (15, 23, 4)> <2, (15, 23, 27)> <2, (15, 25, 27)> <2, (23, 25, 27)> <3, (15, 28, 29)> <3, (15, 28, 10)> <3, (29, 28, 10)> <4, (23, 13, 2)> <5, (1, 12, 24)> <10, (15, 22, 28)> <10, (15, 22, 1)> <10, (15, 22, 13)> <10, (15, 28, 13)> <11, (21, 20, 18)> <12, (5, 14, 24)> <14, (21, 22, 0)> <15, (26, 10, 2)> <16, (6, 27, 16)> <19, (26, 25, 28)> <21, (19, 23, 11)> <24, (5, 4, 12)> <25, (17, 29, 2)> <28, (19, 11, 18)>
