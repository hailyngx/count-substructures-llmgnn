Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 15) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (16, 18) (16, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (15, 17, 7, 19, 4)
- Number of 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 3: <3, (15, 19, 4)>, <3, (15, 7, 19)>, <3, (15, 17, 7)>, <3, (17, 10, 15)>, <3, (4, 19, 18)>, <3, (4, 17, 18)>, <3, (10, 17, 15)>, <3, (10, 15, 6)>, <3, (7, 2, 0)>, <3, (7, 0, 16)>

Node 15 has 5 neighbors: (3, 10, 19, 0, 6)
- Number of 3-stars for node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 15: <15, (3, 10, 19)>, <15, (3, 17, 10)>, <15, (3, 6, 19)>, <15, (17, 10, 6)>, <15, (19, 18, 4)>, <15, (19, 4, 18)>, <15, (10, 17, 3)>, <15, (10, 3, 6)>, <15, (0, 9, 5)>, <15, (0, 6, 19)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: (3, 18)
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (17, 4, 19, 11, 16)
- Number of 3-stars for node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 18: <18, (17, 19, 4)>, <18, (17, 11, 16)>, <18, (17, 16, 0)>, <18, (4, 19, 18)>, <18, (4, 16, 0)>, <18, (19, 11, 16)>, <18, (19, 4, 3)>, <18, (11, 19, 16)>, <18, (11, 4, 18)>, <18, (16, 0, 7)>

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (15, 9, 7, 16)
- Number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 0: <0, (15, 9, 5)>, <0, (15, 7, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 7, 0)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (3, 9, 2, 0)
- Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 7: <7, (3, 0, 15)>, <7, (3, 0, 16)>, <7, (9, 0, 16)>, <7, (9, 2, 0)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (15, 10, 8, 19)
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (15, 10, 8)>, <6, (15, 10, 19)>, <6, (10, 8, 11)>, <6, (10, 19, 15)>

Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (5, 18, 8)
- Number of 3-stars for node 11: 1
- Unique 3-stars for node 11: <11, (5, 18, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars:
10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].
