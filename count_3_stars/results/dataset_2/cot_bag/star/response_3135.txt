Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 14) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55\)

Thus, there are 55 3-stars in the provided graph. In brackets, this is represented as [55].

Unique 3-stars are:
<7, (16, 13, 1)>
<10, (8, 13, 19)>
<13, (16, 8, 1)>
<13, (8, 10, 19)>
<13, (8, 19, 1)>
<13, (10, 19, 1)>
<13, (16, 8, 1)>
<19, (13, 2, 14)>
<14, (4, 12, 18)>
<10, (0, 19, 5)>
<13, (8, 1, 19)>
<3, (7, 6, 5)>
<14, (12, 18, 19)>
<6, (7, 12, 15)>
<13, (1, 19, 8)>
<5, (16, 2, 10)>
<5, (16, 3, 2)>
<5, (16, 2, 10)>
<5, (16, 3, 10)>
<19, (14, 2, 10)>
