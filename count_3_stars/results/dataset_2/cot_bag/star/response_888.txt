Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 100.

So, the answer is [100].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 10>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 13, 3>
<2, 13, 9>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 5, 14>
<4, 0, 12>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 0, 14>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 11, 13>
<12, 0, 5>
<13, 3, 5>
