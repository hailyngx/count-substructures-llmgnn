Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 12) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 16) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 9) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors in parenthesis are given below:
1: (3, 10, 13, 4)
3: (1, 14, 6, 9, 12)
10: (1, 7)
17: (12, 5, 8)
4: (1, 8)
8: (17, 4, 16, 15, 11)
18: (5, 11, 12)
0: (7, 11)
14: (3, 15, 13)
7: (10, 0, 6)
5: (17, 18)
19: (16, 6)
9: (3, 11)
15: (8, 14, 16)
6: (3, 7, 19, 16)
12: (3, 17, 18, 13)
11: (8, 18, 0, 9)
16: (8, 19, 15, 6)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
17: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
18: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
14: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
11: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
16: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 10, 13, 4)>, <3, (1, 14, 6, 9, 12)>, <17, (12, 5, 8)>, <8, (17, 4, 16, 15, 11)>, <18, (5, 11, 12)>, <14, (3, 15, 13)>, <7, (10, 0, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 19, 16)>, <12, (3, 17, 18, 13)>, <11, (8, 18, 0, 9)>, <16, (8, 19, 15, 6)>.
