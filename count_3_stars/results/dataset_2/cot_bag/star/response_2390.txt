Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up.

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 51

So, there are a total of 51 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <5, 7, 14>
- <9, 6, 3>
- <9, 6, 11>
- <9, 6, 12>
- <9, 3, 14>
- <9, 12, 11>
- <6, 10, 11>
- <6, 3, 1>
- <3, 1, 12>
- <3, 1, 2>
- <8, 4, 13>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 13, 7>
- <4, 13, 7>
- <4, 13, 2>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <7, 13, 4>
- <7, 13, 0>
- <7, 4, 14>
- <0, 7, 2>
- <12, 1, 11>
- <2, 3, 14>
- <2, 11, 4>
- <2, 11, 0>
- <14, 9, 3>
- <14, 3, 8>
- <14, 3, 4>
- <14, 8, 5>
- <14, 4, 7> 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
