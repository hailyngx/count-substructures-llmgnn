Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 7) (5, 9) (5, 23) (2, 29) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (7, 26) (7, 2) (21, 19) (21, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (10, 11) (10, 22) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 0) (12, 17) (12, 22) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 15) (6, 8) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 23) (0, 26) (0, 11) (0, 28) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (25, 29) (25, 6) (19, 21) (19, 22) (22, 10) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 24) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 23) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 24) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 15) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 17) (18, 20) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (16, 15) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 16) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 5, 29, 7, 1, 11, 28, 13, 0, 17, 6, 22, 24, 23, 8, 4, 27, 20, 16, and 15.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 61 3-stars. So, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<9, (4, 5, 27)>, <9, (4, 26, 29)>, <9, (5, 26, 29)>, <9, (27, 26, 29)>, <9, (4, 26, 27)>, <1, (3, 6, 28)>, <1, (11, 24, 28)>, <1, (6, 24, 28)>, <1, (6, 11, 28)>, <13, (23, 16, 13)>, <0, (11, 28, 0)>, <0, (11, 26, 0)>, <0, (26, 28, 0)>, <0, (11, 27, 0)>, <17, (4, 8, 17)>, <17, (4, 12, 17)>, <17, (8, 12, 17)>, <17, (4, 27, 17)>, <6, (8, 6, 28)>, <6, (15, 6, 8)>, <6, (15, 6, 28)>, <6, (15, 25, 6)>, <22, (10, 19, 22)>, <22, (10, 12, 22)>, <22, (10, 24, 22)>, <22, (19, 12, 22)>, <24, (8, 23, 24)>, <24, (8, 11, 24)>, <24, (23, 11, 24)>, <24, (8, 22, 24)>, <23, (13, 23, 24)>, <8, (15, 8, 16)>, <4, (9, 4, 21)>, <4, (17, 4, 21)>, <4, (17, 4, 9)>, <27, (3, 27, 28)>, <27, (17, 27, 28)>, <28, (6, 13, 28)>, <28, (0, 27, 28)>, <6, (6, 15, 16)>, <13, (16, 20, 13)>, <20, (16, 20, 18)>, <15, (16, 15, 20)>
