Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 12) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 25) (15, 28) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 15) (28, 18) (0, 7) (0, 10) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 10) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 20) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 19) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 6) (23, 24) (23, 27) (16, 26) (16, 1) (14, 26) (14, 5) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 1) (11, 20) (11, 13) (11, 6) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 23) (1, 16) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 22) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 8) (18, 21) (18, 28) (22, 8) (22, 1) (5, 21) (5, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-star graphs they are a part of:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors as well, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
9. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
10. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
11. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
12. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
13. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars.
14. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
15. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
16. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
17. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
18. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
19. Node 22 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
20. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
21. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
22. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.
23. Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
24. Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
25. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of \(4+4+10+10+4+4+10+10+4+10+10+10+4+4 = 94\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 94, which we represent within brackets as [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 16, 26)>, 
<1, (2, 15, 25)>, 
<1, (2, 15, 28)>, 
<1, (2, 22, 1)>, 
<1, (15, 25, 17)>, 
<1, (15, 25, 1)>, 
<1, (22, 1, 16)>, 
<2, (3, 15, 25)>, 
<2, (3, 15, 28)>, 
<3, (15, 25, 1)>, 
<4, (8, 6, 19)>, 
<7, (12, 26, 16)>, 
<13, (17, 21, 5)>, 
<13, (21, 5, 14)>, 
<13, (21, 18, 28)>, 
<13, (21, 19, 6)>, 
<19, (6, 11, 20)>, 
<21, (29, 17, 25)>.
