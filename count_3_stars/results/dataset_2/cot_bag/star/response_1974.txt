Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are as described. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 8}, forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center. <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>

2. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 6, 9, 7}, forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center. <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <7, (6, 9, 7)>

3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {0, 7, 8, 9, 5}, forming 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 6 as the center. <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>, <6, (0, 9, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <6, (8, 9, 5)>

4. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}, forming 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars with node 9 as the center. <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

5. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}, forming 1 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (0, 4, 9)>

6. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 9}, forming 1 3-star with node 3 as the center. <3, (2, 5, 9)>

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 6}, forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center. <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
