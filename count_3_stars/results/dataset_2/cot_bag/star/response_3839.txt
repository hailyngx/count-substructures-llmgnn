Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 4, node 6, and node 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms 5 3-stars with the following nodes: 5, 6, and 12.
- Therefore, for node 4, there are 5 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with the following nodes: 9, 7, and 12.
- Therefore, for node 6, there is 1 3-star.

For node 12:
- Node 12 forms 3 3-stars with the following nodes: 6, 2, and 10.
- Therefore, for node 12, there are 3 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of [5 + 1 + 3 = 9] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 6, 12)>
<6, (9, 7, 12)>
<12, (6, 2, 10)>
