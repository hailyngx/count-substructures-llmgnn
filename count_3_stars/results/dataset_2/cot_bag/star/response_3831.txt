Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 4, 8, 2, 7, 1
Node 1: 5, 6, 2, 0, 7
Node 2: 4, 8, 1, 0
Node 3: 5, 4, 8, 7
Node 4: 8, 2, 0, 6, 3
Node 5: 6, 1, 3, 7
Node 6: 5, 4, 1, 7
Node 7: 5, 6, 0, 3, 1
Node 8: 4, 2, 0, 3

Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 each have 4 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
