Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars is calculated based on the number of neighbors each node has. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we get a total of 58 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (3, 7, 8)>  
<2, (6, 8, 9)>  
<3, (1, 7, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 8)>  
<6, (0, 5, 9)>  
<8, (1, 4, 6)>  
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
