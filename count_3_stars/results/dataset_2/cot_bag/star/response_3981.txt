Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [50] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
