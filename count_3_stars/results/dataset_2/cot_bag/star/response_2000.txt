Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 0) (15, 10) (0, 9) (0, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 19) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 19. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (5, 11, 12)>, 
<1, (10, 11, 13)>, 
<1, (10, 11, 5)>,

<1, (12, 11, 5)>, 
<1, (5, 11, 7)>, 
<1, (7, 10, 11)>, 
<1, (7, 11, 5)>,
