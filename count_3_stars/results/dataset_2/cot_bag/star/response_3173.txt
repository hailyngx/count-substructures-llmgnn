Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (14, 18, 11)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (18, 12, 17)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (16, 19, 13)>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: <11, (4, 19, 17)>
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: <13, (7, 3, 6)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: <14, (18, 9, 4)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: <15, (8, 17, 19)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (18, 7, 17)>
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: <17, (18, 16, 5)>, <17, (18, 15, 11)>
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: <18, (16, 4, 17)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: <19, (7, 12, 11)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 13. So, the final answer is [13].
