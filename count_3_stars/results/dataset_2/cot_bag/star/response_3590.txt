Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 18) (3, 19) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 18. 

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{2}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 18, 0)>
<2, (13, 14, 2)>
<3, (19, 3, 4)>
<5, (13, 17, 5)>
<6, (0, 18, 6)>
<7, (10, 11, 7)>
<11, (14, 11, 2)>
<13, (17, 13, 12)>
<15, (17, 15, 6)>
<17, (15, 17, 18)>
