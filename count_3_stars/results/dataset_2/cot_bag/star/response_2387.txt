Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 21) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 28) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 29) (17, 16) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 10) (22, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 20) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 15) (27, 3) (27, 14) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 25) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 15) (21, 11) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 19) (19, 10) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 5) (28, 2) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 6) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 26) (13, 23) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 13) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 12) (12, 0) (12, 23) (12, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: {7, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 10}
- Node 2: {21, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {1, 18, 27, 29}
- Node 4: {14, 15, 24}
- Node 5: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 20}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 20}
- Node 8: {5, 25}
- Node 9: {23}
- Node 10: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 16, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 23}
- Node 13: {23, 25}
- Node 14: {4, 22, 25, 26, 27}
- Node 15: {4, 16, 26}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 17, 21}
- Node 17: {16, 24, 29}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {10}
- Node 20: {6, 7, 26}
- Node 21: {2, 11, 16, 25}
- Node 22: {14}
- Node 23: {9, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 24: {4, 17, 18}
- Node 25: {8, 13, 14, 21}
- Node 26: {2, 14, 15, 20}
- Node 27: {3, 14}
- Node 28: {2, 5}
- Node 29: {3, 10, 17, 25}

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 26, 29
- Total 3-stars from these nodes: \( \binom{9}{3} + 1 + 1 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \)
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{9}{3} + 1 + 1 + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 84 \)

Thus, there are 84 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [84]
