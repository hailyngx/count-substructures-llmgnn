Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 6) (17, 5) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 4) (8, 0) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 11) (3, 16) (3, 6) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
With the given information, let's construct the graph first:

- Node 0: (8, 1, 7, 16)
- Node 1: (0, 18, 7)
- Node 2: (15, 4)
- Node 3: (16, 6)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 12)
- Node 5: (17, 7, 13, 4)
- Node 6: (17, 13, 3, 11)
- Node 7: (14, 1, 0, 13, 5)
- Node 8: (0)
- Node 9: (14, 10, 18, 11)
- Node 10: (9)
- Node 11: (12, 18, 6, 9)
- Node 12: (15, 4, 11)
- Node 13: (7, 5, 19, 6)
- Node 14: (7, 9)
- Node 15: (2, 12)
- Node 16: (0, 19, 3)
- Node 17: (6, 5)
- Node 18: (1, 19, 11, 9)
- Node 19: (13, 18, 16)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19 have 4 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 37, and we list them as follows: 
\[ [37] \]
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 18>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 16>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 5>, <4, 2, 15>, <4, 5, 17>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 12, 15>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 13, 7>, <5, 13, 19>, <5, 13, 6>, <5, 13, 7>, <6, 17, 5>, <6, 17, 13>, <6, 13, 7>, <6, 13, 5>, <7, 14, 9>, <7, 14, 0>, <7, 14, 13>, <7, 14, 1>, <7, 14, 13>, <7, 14, 1>, <7, 14, 0>, <7, 14, 9>, <9, 14, 10>, <9, 14, 18>, <9, 14, 11>, <9, 14, 18>, <9, 14, 11>, <9, 10, 18>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 18, 1>, <9, 18, 11>, <9, 18, 1>, <9, 18, 11>, <11, 12, 18>, <11, 12, 4>, <11, 12, 6>, <11, 12, 4>, <11, 18, 1>, <11, 18, 6>, <11, 18, 9>, <11, 18, 6>, <12, 15, 2>, <12, 15, 4>, <12, 15, 11>, <12, 15, 4>, <13, 7, 5>, <13, 7, 14>, <13, 7, 5>, <13, 7, 14>, <13, 7, 14>, <16, 0, 1>, <16, 0, 19>, <16, 0, 3>, <16, 19, 18>, <18, 1, 0>, <18, 1, 7>, <18, 1, 11>, <18, 1, 7>, <18, 11, 12>, <18, 11, 9>, <18, 11, 6>, <18, 11, 9>, <19, 13, 7>, <19, 13, 18>, <19, 13, 16>, <19, 13, 18>
