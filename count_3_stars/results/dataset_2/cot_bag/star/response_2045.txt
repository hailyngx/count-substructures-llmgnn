Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees are as follows: 
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for node 0, 1, 2 will result in 4 three-star structures each.  
Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for node 3, 6, 13 will result in 10 three-star structures each.  

Summing up, we have \(4 \times 3 + 10 \times 3 = 42\) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (3, 6, 13)>  
<1, (4, 8, 11)>  
<2, (5, 9, 10)>  
<3, (0, 7, 14)>  
<4, (1, 8, 9)>  
<5, (2, 6, 12)>  
<6, (3, 5, 10)>  
<7, (0, 4, 13)>  
<8, (1, 4, 13)>  
<9, (2, 4, 11)>  
<10, (2, 6, 3)>  
<11, (1, 4, 12)>  
<12, (2, 9, 11)>  
<13, (0, 7, 14)>  
<14, (1, 3, 13)>
