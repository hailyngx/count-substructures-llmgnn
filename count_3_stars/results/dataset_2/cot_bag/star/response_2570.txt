Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 26) (18, 23) (18, 10) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 8) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 29) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 23) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 14) (16, 3) (16, 15) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 23) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 0) (23, 18) (23, 26) (23, 28) (6, 8) (7, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 21) (9, 3) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 14) (10, 5) (20, 27) (20, 8) (20, 4) (0, 2) (0, 19) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (4, 28) (4, 20) (4, 24) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 25) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 29, 18, 12, 27, 1, 26, 13, and 3.

For node 2:
- It has 4 neighbors: (29, 3, 25, 0)
- The number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (29, 3, 25)>, <2, (29, 3, 0)>, <2, (29, 25, 0)>, <2, (3, 25, 0)>

For node 29:
- It has 4 neighbors: (2, 19, 26, 3)
- The number of 3-stars with node 29 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <29, (2, 19, 26)>, <29, (2, 19, 3)>, <29, (2, 26, 3)>, <29, (19, 26, 3)>

For node 18:
- It has 4 neighbors: (23, 10, 24, 21)
- The number of 3-stars with node 18 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <18, (23, 10, 24)>, <18, (23, 10, 21)>, <18, (23, 24, 21)>, <18, (10, 24, 21)>

For node 12:
- It has 5 neighbors: (27, 28, 11, 1, 8)
- The number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <12, (27, 28, 11)>, <12, (27, 28, 1)>, <12, (27, 28, 8)>, <12, (27, 11, 1)>, <12, (27, 11, 8)>, <12, (27, 1, 8)>, <12, (28, 11, 1)>, <12, (28, 11, 8)>, <12, (28, 1, 8)>, <12, (11, 1, 8)>

For node 27:
- It has 3 neighbors: (12, 20, 8)
- The number of 3-stars with node 27 as the center: 1
- Unique 3-stars: <27, (12, 20, 8)>

For node 1, 26, 13, and 3:
- Each has exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 unique 3-star. 
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (26, 5, 12)>, <26, (1, 13, 23)>, <13, (26, 11, 14)>, and <3, (2, 9, 21)>

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 26 and can be denoted as [26].
