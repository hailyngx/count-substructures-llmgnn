Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 5) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 11) (8, 28) (8, 15) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 18) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 28) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 0) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 22) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 24) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 21) (3, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 24) (12, 20) (12, 16) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 5) (23, 16) (14, 20) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 6) (6, 25) (6, 27) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 13) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 34 3-stars. 
Hence, the final answer is [34].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (7, 9, 22)>, <3, (17, 21, 13)>, <4, (1, 7, 22)>, <5, (10, 14, 19)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <15, (1, 13, 8)>, <16, (12, 2, 23)>, <17, (3, 11, 29)>, <18, (19, 24, 29)>, <19, (5, 18, 25)>, <20, (12, 14, 22)>, <21, (9, 10, 3)>, <22, (0, 20, 28)>, <24, (13, 18, 9)>, <25, (14, 20, 6)>, <28, (22, 2, 8)>, <29, (11, 17, 18)>
