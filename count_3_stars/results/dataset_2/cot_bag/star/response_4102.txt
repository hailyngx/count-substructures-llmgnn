Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 11) (26, 27) (2, 7) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 25) (12, 0) (29, 17) (29, 24) (29, 3) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 25) (17, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 26) (11, 19) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 25) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 16) (25, 12) (25, 17) (25, 27) (1, 18) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 19) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 8) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 23) (5, 0) (23, 16) (23, 5) (23, 20) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 0) (8, 18) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
From the given information, the nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <0, (9, 19, 5)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <3, (9, 19, 29)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <4, (27, 20, 24)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <5, (10, 23, 0)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <6, (18, 1, 4)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <7, (2, 10, 14)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <8, (18, 21, 24)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <9, (26, 0, 3)>.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <10, (7, 15, 21)>.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <13, (3, 16, 14)>.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <14, (7, 13, 20)>.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <15, (10, 16, 13)>.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <16, (15, 19, 23)>.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <17, (29, 21, 27)>.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <18, (6, 1, 8)>.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <19, (3, 11, 0)>.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <20, (4, 23, 14)>.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <21, (7, 8, 17)>.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <23, (16, 5, 20)>.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <24, (29, 8, 4)>.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <25, (12, 17, 27)>.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star: <26, (9, 11, 27)>.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <27, (26, 17, 4)>.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]. The 3-stars are: <29, (17, 24, 3)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 35, represented as [35].
