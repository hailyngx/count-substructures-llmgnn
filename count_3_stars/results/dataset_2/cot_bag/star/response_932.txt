Response:
There are several nodes in this graph, each connected to a varying number of other nodes. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars and find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Starting with node 0, it has 1 neighbor. Moving on to node 1, it has 3 neighbors: 19, 12, and 8. So, node 1 forms 1 3-star <1, (19, 12, 8)>.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 29, 16, and 24, forming 1 3-star <2, (29, 16, 24)>.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 17, and 8, forming 1 3-star <3, (5, 17, 8)>.

Node 4 has 1 neighbor.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 19, 22, and 3, forming 1 3-star <5, (9, 19, 22)>.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 17, 19, 26, and 8, forming 1 3-star <7, (17, 19, 8)>.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 22, 1, 3, and 7, forming 1 3-star <8, (22, 1, 7)>.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 22, 28, and 11, forming 1 3-star <9, (5, 22, 28)>.

Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 23, and 14, forming 1 3-star <10, (4, 23, 14)>.

Node 11 has 2 neighbors.

Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 18, 20, and 1, forming 1 3-star <12, (18, 20, 1)>.

Node 13 has 1 neighbor.

Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 29, 16, 6, and 10, forming 1 3-star <14, (29, 16, 6)>.

Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 16, 24, and 1, forming 1 3-star <15, (16, 24, 1)>.

Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 2, 15, 21, 24, and 14, forming 1 3-star <16, (2, 15, 21)>.

Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 3, 21, 7, and 19, forming 1 3-star <17, (3, 21, 7)>.

Node 18 has 2 neighbors.

Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 5, 29, 7, 1, and 6, forming 1 3-star <19, (5, 29, 7)>.

Node 20 has 2 neighbors.

Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 17, 16, 26, 11, and 25, forming 1 3-star <21, (17, 16, 26)>.

Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 8, forming 1 3-star <22, (5, 9, 8)>.

Node 23 has 2 neighbors.

Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 2, 15, and 16, forming 1 3-star <24, (2, 15, 16)>.

Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 18, 23, and 21, forming 1 3-star <25, (18, 23, 21)>.

Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 21, 27, and 7, forming 1 3-star <26, (21, 27, 7)>.

Node 27 has 2 neighbors.

Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 29, 0, 13, and 9, forming 1 3-star <28, (29, 0, 13)>.

Node 29 has 5 neighbors: 2, 29, 27, 19, and 14, forming 1 3-star <29, (2, 27, 19)>.

There is a total of 22 unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
