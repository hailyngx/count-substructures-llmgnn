Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 13, 14
  - Total 3-stars: 3 stars with node 0, <0, (13, 14, 3)>, <0, (14, 3, 13)>, <0, (13, 3, 14)>
  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 11
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 7, 14, 3, 11, 10
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 14, 6, 3, 5
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 11, 10
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 2, 5, 1
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 12, 14, 8, 11, 10
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 14, 8, 9, 6, 2
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 6, 2
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 13, 1, 9
  - Total 3-stars: 3 stars with node 12, <12, (1, 9, 13)>, <12, (13, 1, 9)>, <12, (1, 13, 9)>  

- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 12, 0, 5, 1
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

- Node 14 has 6 neighbors: 4, 0, 8, 9, 2, 10
  - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  

The total number of 3-stars is 3 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 20 = 92

Therefore, in the provided graph, there are a total of 92 3-stars.  
\[92\]
