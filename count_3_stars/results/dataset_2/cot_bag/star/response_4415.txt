Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 1, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}

From the list above, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 7 have more than 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are \(10 + 10 + 10 = 30\) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
