Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges and identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 15, and 24
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 0, 18, 28, and 1
- Node 7 is connected to node 21
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 16
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 15
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 27, 20
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 20, 9, and 16
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 18, 15, and 29
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 27, 26, and 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 27 and 2
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 12, 22, and 11
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 28, 6, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 21 and 19
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 20 and 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 15 and 24
- Node 5 is connected to node 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5 and 25
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 17, 14, 24, and 25
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 22, and 19
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 26 and 24
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 21, 15, and 13
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 17, 14, 25, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to node 22
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 13, and 23
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 27, 29, 16, and 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 28, 26, and 23
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 16, 12, 4, and 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 24, 23, and 25
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 22, and 19

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <0, (27, 15, 24)>
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <27, (0, 18, 28)>
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <21, (7, 3, 16)>
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <15, (0, 2, 20)>
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <28, (27, 26, 4)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <17, (12, 22, 11)>
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <26, (28, 6, 4)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <16, (21, 15, 13)>
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <22, (17, 14, 25)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <12, (17, 13, 23)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <13, (27, 29, 16)>
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <23, (16, 12, 4)>
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <19, (3, 14, 24)>
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: forms 1 3-star <25, (10, 11, 22)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node with three or more neighbors, we get: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13.
