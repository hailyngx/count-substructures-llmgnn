Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 9) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 24) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 7) (27, 9) (5, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 25) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (17, 20) (17, 12) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (19, 20) (19, 6) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 18) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 15) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 23) (23, 21) (23, 5) (23, 10) (23, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (24, 25) (24, 16) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 28) (9, 10) (4, 14) (29, 21) (29, 13) (29, 11) (29, 18) (7, 1) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {21, 22, 13, 16}.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {20, 0, 24, 18}.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {6, 16, 23, 29, 3}.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {25, 17, 19, 16}.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {22, 28, 10, 26}.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
