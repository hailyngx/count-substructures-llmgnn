Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the information provided. 

The graph has 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

The edges in the graph are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 0, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 4, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0.

Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3-stars = 1
- Node 1: 3-stars = 1
- Node 2: 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 1
- Node 4: 3-stars = 1
- Node 5: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = 1
- Node 8: 3-stars = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>
