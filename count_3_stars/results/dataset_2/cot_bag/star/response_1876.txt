Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 10)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 10, 13)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (8, 9, 12)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 14)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 9, 13)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 11)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (0, 2, 12)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (1, 9, 6)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (0, 7, 14)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (0, 6, 13)>

So, there are a total of 13 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
