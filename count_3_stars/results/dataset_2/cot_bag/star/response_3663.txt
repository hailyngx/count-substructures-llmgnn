Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 0, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 8, 0, 2
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 4) = 14 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 0, 9)>
<5, (7, 0, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>
<4, (8, 0, 2)>
<4, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (8, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
