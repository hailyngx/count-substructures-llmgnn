Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 9) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 21) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 6) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 19) (1, 22) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 17) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 29) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 29) (29, 19) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 14) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 4) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 11) (25, 11) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 2) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 24) (21, 22) (21, 23) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 25) (11, 24) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 16) (24, 11) (10, 26) (10, 18) (2, 6) (2, 27) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 18) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- Node 26: Only 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: Only 1 3-star
- Node 19: Only 1 3-star
- Node 17: Only 1 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: Only 1 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: Only 1 3-star
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<22, (23, 1, 21)>, <22, (23, 1, 4)>, <22, (1, 21, 23)>, <22, (1, 21, 24)>, <22, (1, 21, 9)>, <22, (23, 4, 21)>, <22, (23, 4, 24)>, <22, (23, 4, 1)>, <22, (23, 24, 21)>, <22, (23, 24, 1)>, <1, (22, 26, 16)>, <26, (1, 10, 17)>, <6, (28, 2, 12)>, <6, (28, 2, 27)>, <6, (28, 2, 16)>, <9, (3, 15, 22)>, <9, (3, 15, 8)>, <9, (3, 15, 7)>, <9, (3, 15, 9)>, <9, (15, 22, 9)>, <9, (15, 22, 8)>, <9, (15, 22, 7)>, <9, (15, 22, 21)>, <9, (22, 9, 8)>, <9, (22, 9, 7)>, <9, (22, 9, 21)>, <9, (22, 9, 15)>, <9, (22, 9, 27)>, <9, (9, 8, 7)>, <9, (9, 8, 15)>, <9, (9, 8, 27)>, <9, (9, 8, 22)>, <9, (9, 7, 15)>, <9, (9, 7, 22)>, <9, (9, 7, 27)>, <9, (9, 7, 9)>, <9, (8, 7, 15)>, <9, (8, 7, 22)>, <9, (8, 7, 27)>, <9, (8, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 15, 22)>, <9, (7, 15, 27)>, <9, (7, 15, 9)>
