Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (9, 8, 4, 0, 7)
- Number of 3-stars with node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>

2. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (5, 6, 4, 1, 7)
- Number of 3-stars with node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>

3. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (9, 2, 0)
- Number of 3-stars with node 6: 1
<6, (9, 2, 0)>

4. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (9, 3, 4, 7)
- Number of 3-stars with node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>

5. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7, 2)
- Number of 3-stars with node 3: 1
<3, (1, 7, 2)>

6. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9, 1, 8, 2)
- Number of 3-stars with node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (1, 8, 2)>

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 2, 7)
- Number of 3-stars with node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (5, 4, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <8, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>

8. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (6, 3, 4, 8)
- Number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>

9. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (5, 6)
- Node 0 doesn't form any 3-stars due to having less than 3 neighbors.

10. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9, 1, 3, 8)
- Number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 3)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 3)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>

In total, there are 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54 3-stars in the given graph: [54].
