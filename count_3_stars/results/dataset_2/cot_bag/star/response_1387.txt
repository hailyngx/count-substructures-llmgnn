Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 3, 7, 1, 11, 6, 9, 12, 2, 5, and 14. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we have:
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 77 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 7, 12)>, <3, (1, 6, 10)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <12, (0, 7, 3)>, <12, (1, 5, 14)>
