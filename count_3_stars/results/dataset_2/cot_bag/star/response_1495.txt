Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62.

So, there are a total of 62 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 8, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 8>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 9, 2>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 8, 0>, <6, 2, 7>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 6, 2>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 0>, <9, 3, 5>.
