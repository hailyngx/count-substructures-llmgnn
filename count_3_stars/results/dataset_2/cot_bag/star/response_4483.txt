Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 20) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 22) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 22) (8, 18) (29, 5) (24, 6) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 15) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 18) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 20) (12, 17) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 2) (11, 14) (11, 25) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (15, 9) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 10) (27, 17) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 13) (25, 2) (25, 11) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 15, 5
- Node 1: 0, 20
- Node 2: 12, 22, 13, 25
- Node 3: 0, 14, 27
- Node 4: 8, 19, 16
- Node 5: 21, 14, 0, 29
- Node 6: 10, 21, 24
- Node 7: 20, 21
- Node 8: 9, 4, 19, 22, 18
- Node 9: 8, 15
- Node 10: 6, 17, 27, 23
- Node 11: 14, 25
- Node 12: 17, 2
- Node 13: 28, 2, 18
- Node 14: 3, 11, 18, 5
- Node 15: 9, 26, 16, 0
- Node 16: 4, 15, 28
- Node 17: 10, 12, 27
- Node 18: 8, 28, 14, 13
- Node 19: 4, 8, 20
- Node 20: 1, 7, 19
- Node 21: 6, 7, 22, 5, 23
- Node 22: 21, 8, 2
- Node 23: 21, 10
- Node 24: 6, 26
- Node 25: 2, 11
- Node 26: 24, 15
- Node 27: 3, 10, 17
- Node 28: 16, 13, 18
- Node 29: 5

Based on this information, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.

Putting all together, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 15)>
<3, (0, 14, 27)>
<5, (0, 21, 29)>
<8, (4, 19, 22)>
<14, (3, 11, 18)>
<18, (8, 13, 28)>
<21, (5, 22, 23)>
