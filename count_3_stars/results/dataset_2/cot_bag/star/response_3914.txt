Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 14, 8, 12, 11, 13, 1, 2, 10.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes gives:
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 67 \]
So, there are a total of 67 3-stars in the given graph.
