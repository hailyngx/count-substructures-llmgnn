Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's break it down:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 54 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 6, 3)>
