Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 7) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 6) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 19) (25, 1) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 5) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 6) (22, 11) (22, 16) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 8) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (8, 26) (8, 12) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 1) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 17) (21, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 12) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 16) (1, 25) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 23) (11, 22) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 5, 0, 20, 21, 28, 2, 18, 26. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)    

Therefore, there are 32 3-stars in the graph.  

Putting this final number inside brackets we have: [32].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<5, 14, 17>  
<0, 3, 10>  
<20, 0, 28>  
<21, 5, 17>  
<28, 24, 29>  
<2, 7, 18>  
<18, 6, 26>  
<26, 8, 13>
