Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 29) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (18, 3) (18, 12) (28, 16) (28, 17) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 7) (25, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 27) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 20) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 11) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (17, 28) (17, 23) (20, 7) (20, 5) (20, 10) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 5) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 14) (27, 7) (27, 9) (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 17) (21, 2) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: 29, 22, 23
2: 29, 22, 26, 21
3: 16, 26, 22, 18
4: 25, 9, 14, 21
5: 15, 0, 26, 12, 20
6: 
7: 25, 20, 24, 27
8: 13, 9, 12
9: 8, 4, 0, 27
10: 19, 20, 14
11: 24, 21
12: 8, 13, 18, 5
13: 8, 12
14: 4, 10, 21
15: 5, 29
16: 3, 28, 0, 23
17: 28, 23
18: 3, 12
19: 10, 21
20: 7, 5, 10
21: 2, 11, 14, 4, 19
22: 3, 2, 1
23: 16, 1, 17
24: 7, 0, 11
25: 7, 4
26: 3, 2, 5
27: 7, 9
28: 16, 17
29: 2, 15, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph using the formula explained earlier.

Based on the degrees of the nodes, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: [3 stars]
<1, (29, 22, 23)>

Node 2: [3 stars]
<2, (29, 22, 26)>

Node 3: [3 stars]
<3, (16, 26, 22)>

Node 4: [3 stars]
<4, (25, 9, 14)>

Node 5: [3 stars]
<5, (15, 0, 26)>

Node 7: [3 stars]
<7, (25, 20, 24)>

Node 9: [0 stars]

Node 10: [3 stars]
<10, (19, 20, 14)>

Node 11: [3 stars]
<11, (24, 21, 11)>

Node 12: [3 stars]
<12, (8, 13, 18)>

Node 14: [3 stars]
<14, (4, 10, 21)>

Node 15: [3 stars]
<15, (5, 0, 26)>

Node 16: [3 stars]
<16, (3, 28, 0)>

Node 18: [3 stars]
<18, (3, 12, 18)>

Node 19: [0 stars]

Node 20: [3 stars]
<20, (7, 5, 10)>

Node 21: [3 stars]
<21, (2, 11, 14)>

Node 22: [3 stars]
<22, (3, 2, 1)>

Node 23: [3 stars]
<23, (16, 1, 17)>

Node 24: [3 stars]
<24, (7, 0, 11)>

Node 25: [3 stars]
<25, (7, 4, 25)>

Node 26: [3 stars]
<26, (3, 2, 5)>

Node 27: [0 stars]

Node 28: [3 stars]
<28, (16, 17, 28)>

Node 29: [3 stars]
<29, (2, 15, 1)>

Counting all the 3-stars: 17 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].
