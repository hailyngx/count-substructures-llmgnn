Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors, namely nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 72 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 12)>
<3, (5, 11, 12)>
<3, (7, 12, 13)>
<3, (11, 12, 13)>
<5, (7, 10, 13)>
<7, (5, 10, 13)>
<10, (5, 7, 13)>
<11, (3, 12, 13)>
<12, (3, 7, 11)>
<13, (6, 10, 14)>
