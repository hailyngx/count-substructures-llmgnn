Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are given as: {(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 1), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 2), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 6), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 1), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6)}

The degrees of the nodes are:  
deg(0) = 4  
deg(1) = 4  
deg(2) = 3  
deg(3) = 4  
deg(4) = 4  
deg(5) = 5  
deg(6) = 4  
deg(7) = 3  
deg(8) = 5  
deg(9) = 4  

There is one 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
There is one 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (5, 4, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars = [2].
