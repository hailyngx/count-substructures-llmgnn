Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 17) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 2) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 10, 13)>
<2, (8, 17, 19)>
<5, (6, 7, 18)>
<6, (0, 5, 18)>
<15, (3, 7, 19)>
<17, (1, 2, 4)>
<18, (5, 6, 10)>
<19, (2, 14, 15)>
