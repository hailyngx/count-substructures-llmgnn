Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 3, 10, 11, 1, 2, 8, 0, 14, 5, 13, 7, and 4.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 63 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [63].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<6, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<3, (1, 6, 14)>
<10, (9, 11, 4)>
<11, (6, 10, 5)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (1, 2, 14)>
<0, (9, 5, 12)>
<14, (6, 8, 13)>
<5, (3, 0, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 14)>
<7, (10, 2, 8)>
<4, (10, 2, 12)>
