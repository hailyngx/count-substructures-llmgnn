Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {6, 5, 2}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 5, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 5, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 3}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 and Node 9 also form 10 3-stars each.
- The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
