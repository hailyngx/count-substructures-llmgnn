Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with multiple neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars based on the given graph:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 107 \)

So, there are [107] unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, 3, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 6, 7>, <0, 3, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 6, 9>, <0, 4, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 0, 9>, <2, 1, 0, 3>, <2, 1, 0, 8>, <2, 1, 0, 7>, <2, 6, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 9, 8>, <3, 7, 8, 4>, <4, 5, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 3, 0>, <4, 6, 2, 7>, <4, 6, 2, 0>, <4, 6, 7, 2>, <4, 6, 7, 3>, <4, 6, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 9, 8>, <4, 7, 9, 0>, <4, 7, 8, 9>, <6, 4, 7, 9>, <6, 4, 7, 0>
