Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (27, 18) (27, 17) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 22) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 16) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 13) (5, 3) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 18) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 4) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 21) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 22) (19, 28) (19, 12) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 16) (8, 18) (24, 11) (24, 12) (20, 1) (20, 5) (20, 4) (15, 12) (15, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (21, 26) (21, 23) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, and 27. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up these results, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 52 \).

Therefore, there are 52 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final count inside brackets gives us: [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
