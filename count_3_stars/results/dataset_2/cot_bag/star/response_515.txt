Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 13, 11.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 17.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 14, 15.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 11, 17, 8.
Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 8, 13, 16.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 16, 0, 7.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 19, 10, 11.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 8, 2.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 12, 16.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 15, 1, 17, 19.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 4, 13, 16, 2.
Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1, 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <5, (9, 6, 13)>, <5, (9, 6, 11)>, <5, (9, 13, 11)>, <5, (6, 13, 11)>
  
- Node 9: [3 choose 3] = 1
  <9, (5, 8, 17)>
  
- Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1
  <6, (5, 14, 15)>
  
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <3, (15, 11, 17)>, <3, (15, 11, 8)>, <3, (15, 17, 8)>, <3, (11, 17, 8)>
  
- Node 15: [5 choose 3] = 10
  <15, (6, 8, 13)>, <15, (6, 8, 16)>, <15, (6, 13, 16)>, <15, (8, 13, 16)>, <15, (3, 8, 13)>, <15, (3, 8, 16)>, <15, (3, 13, 16)>, <15, (8, 13, 3)>, <15, (8, 13, 16)>, <15, (8, 3, 16)>
  
- Node 1: [3 choose 3] = 1
  <1, (16, 0, 7)>
  
- Node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1
  <4, (19, 10, 11)>
  
- Node 14: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <14, (6, 11, 8)>, <14, (6, 11, 2)>, <14, (6, 8, 2)>, <14, (11, 8, 2)>
  
- Node 17: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <17, (9, 3, 12)>, <17, (9, 3, 16)>, <17, (9, 12, 16)>, <17, (3, 12, 16)>
  
- Node 16: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <16, (15, 1, 17)>, <16, (15, 1, 19)>, <16, (15, 17, 19)>, <16, (1, 17, 19)>
  
- Node 19: [4 choose 3] = 4
  <19, (4, 13, 16)>, <19, (4, 13, 2)>, <19, (4, 16, 2)>, <19, (13, 16, 2)>
  
Adding up all the calculated 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
