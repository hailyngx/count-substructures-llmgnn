Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now we will count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>

For Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>

For Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 0)>

For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>

For Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>

For Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>

For Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 40.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>,
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 0)>,
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>,
<4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>,
<5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>,
<8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
