Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's examine each node to see if it can form a 3-star.

For each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 10, 2, 18, 14. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 18, 12, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 12, 14, 0, 2. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 14, 9, 19. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 17, 8. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 11, 16, 18. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 17, 15, 11. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 1. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 9, 15, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 17, 8, 3. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 0, 14. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 5, 12, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 2, 11, 1. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 10, 2, 0, 3. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 8, 6. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 5, 19. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 10, 17, 6, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 5, 0, 1. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 13, 16, 3. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets: [10].
