Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 1, 12
Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 6, 7, 14, 8, 1, 13
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 8, 13
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 15
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 12, 4
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 3, 11, 2, 13
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 14, 10
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, 8
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 3, 12
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 0, 1
Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 5, 7, 0, 14, 2, 3
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 2, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- For nodes with 6 neighbors, we have 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars

Calculating for each eligible node:
Node 0: 4 3-stars
Node 2: 20 3-stars
Node 3: 4 3-stars
Node 7: 10 3-stars
Node 9: 4 3-stars
Node 11: 4 3-stars
Node 12: 4 3-stars
Node 13: 20 3-stars
Node 14: 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 70

Thus, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
