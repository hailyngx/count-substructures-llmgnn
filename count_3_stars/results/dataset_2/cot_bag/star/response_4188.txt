Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 edges are nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars for node 2 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 3, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars for node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (9, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (8, 3, 2)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars for node 5 = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
<5, (9, 1, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 2)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars for node 6 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<6, (1, 5, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars for node 7 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<7, (5, 2, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 4)>, <7, (3, 8, 2)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars for node 9 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 5)>, <9, (3, 8, 4)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [79].
