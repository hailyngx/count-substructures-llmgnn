Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (2, 24) (29, 17) (29, 7) (0, 15) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 23) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 15) (1, 26) (1, 7) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 20) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 14) (28, 5) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (21, 16) (21, 13) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 3) (10, 27) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 22) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 9) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 13) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 18) (18, 23) (18, 13) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 5) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 20) (9, 14) (5, 12) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  11, 16, 22, 23, 27, 26, 29, 7, 3, 4, 15, 19, 24, 13, 5, 9, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <11, (16, 26, 4)>, <11, (16, 20, 21)>, <11, (16, 4, 22)>, <11, (16, 21, 24)>

2. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <16, (11, 21, 24)>, <16, (11, 24, 22)>, <16, (11, 22, 23)>, <16, (21, 22, 24)>

3. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <22, (16, 23, 4)>, <22, (16, 4, 8)>, <22, (23, 4, 18)>, <22, (23, 18, 8)>

4. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <23, (27, 22, 18)>

5. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <27, (12, 23, 10)>

6. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <26, (11, 1, 20)>

7. Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

8. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <7, (29, 1, 14)>, <7, (29, 25, 1)>, <7, (29, 13, 1)>, <7, (29, 14, 25)>, <7, (1, 25, 14)>,
   <7, (1, 25, 19)>, <7, (1, 19, 9)>, <7, (25, 19, 9)>, <7, (19, 9, 14)>, <7, (9, 14, 5)>

9. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <3, (20, 6, 4)>, <3, (20, 5, 6)>, <3, (20, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 13, 4)>

10. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <4, (11, 22, 3)>

11. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <15, (0, 12, 17)>

12. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <19, (1, 25, 9)>, <19, (1, 9, 20)>, <19, (25, 9, 14)>, <19, (9, 14, 5)>

13. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <24, (16, 2, 13)>, <24, (16, 13, 21)>, <24, (2, 13, 28)>, <24, (13, 18, 28)>

14. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <13, (7, 21, 6)>, <13, (7, 6, 24)>, <13, (7, 24, 18)>, <13, (7, 18, 13)>, <13, (21, 18, 24)>,
   <13, (21, 6, 4)>, <13, (6, 4, 3)>, <13, (4, 3, 5)>, <13, (6, 3, 5)>, <13, (18, 4, 28)>

15. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (12, 28, 14)>, <5, (12, 3, 14)>, <5, (12, 20, 28)>, <5, (28, 20, 14)>, <5, (3, 20, 6)>,
   <5, (3, 6, 14)>, <5, (3, 14, 9)>, <5, (20, 9, 14)>, <5, (20, 9, 13)>, <5, (9, 13, 14)>

16. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <9, (10, 20, 14)>, <9, (10, 14, 5)>, <9, (10, 5, 19)>, <9, (20, 5, 14)>

17. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <14, (28, 7, 5)>, <14, (28, 9, 5)>, <14, (7, 9, 5)>, <14, (9, 5, 13)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46.
