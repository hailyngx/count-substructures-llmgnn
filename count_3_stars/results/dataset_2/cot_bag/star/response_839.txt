Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [22]\).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>.
