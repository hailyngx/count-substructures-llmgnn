Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 15) (2, 10) (29, 22) (7, 21) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 19) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (26, 0) (26, 24) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 1) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 22) (3, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 9) (28, 22) (4, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 5) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 6) (5, 18) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 28) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are some nodes with more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for those nodes.

Let's list the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 12, 14, 19, 26, 28
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 9, 13, 21
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 2, 20, 23, 6
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 16
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 23, 27
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 18, 19
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 8, 11, 21
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 3, 14, 27, 0
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 10, 25
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 7, 16, 3
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 3, 28, 29, 22
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 10, 12, 20
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors: 0, 24
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 19
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 9, 22, 24, 28
- Node 29 has 1 neighbor: 22

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors and sum them up:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 14, 19, 28>
- <7, 1, 13, 21>
- <10, 2, 20, 23>
- <12, 0, 6, 27>
- <22, 3, 28, 29>
- <16, 8, 11, 21>
- <19, 0, 3, 27>
- <20, 2, 4, 25>
