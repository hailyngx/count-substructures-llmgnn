Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
