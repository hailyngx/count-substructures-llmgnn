Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 10, 19)>, <1, (5, 13, 15)>, <3, (8, 11, 18)>, <3, (12, 13, 18)>, <3, (11, 13, 16)>, <3, (11, 13, 5)>, <4, (5, 8, 13)>, <7, (0, 12, 14)>, <8, (3, 18, 12)>, <11, (13, 16, 3)>, <12, (0, 13, 18)>, <13, (1, 12, 5)>, <14, (1, 17, 7)>, <15, (1, 16, 19)>, <17, (1, 14, 19)>, <18, (0, 3, 8)>.
