Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 25) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 10) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (27, 17) (27, 20) (27, 19) (3, 26) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (19, 27) (19, 15) (0, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 22) (11, 13) (14, 1) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 16) (28, 8) (28, 17) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 29) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 29) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 18) (23, 20) (23, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 26, 21, 7, 4
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 22, 13, 17, 22
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 28, 10
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 8, 4, 12, 18
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 5, 10
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 1, 20, 23, 16
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 17, 4, 19, 13, 29
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 9, 14, 29
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 6, 28, 20, 27, 15
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 25, 10, 29
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 17, 27, 22, 14, 23
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 21, 6, 20, 11
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 0, 18
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 15, 16, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 14 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 20 forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars for each node: 
1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 60. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 7, 21)>
<6, (5, 13, 22)>
<8, (1, 10, 28)>
<10, (4, 12, 18)>
<12, (5, 9, 10)>
<14, (1, 16, 23)>
<15, (13, 17, 29)>
<16, (9, 14, 29)>
<17, (15, 20, 28)>
<18, (10, 25, 29)>
<20, (14, 22, 23)>
<22, (11, 20, 21)>
<25, (7, 18, 0)>
<29, (15, 16, 18)>
