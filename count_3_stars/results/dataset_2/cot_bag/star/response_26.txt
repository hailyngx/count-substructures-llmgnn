Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 13, 0, 7, 10, 14, 4, and 12. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 81

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [81].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (7, 11, 13)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 10, 13)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <13, (1, 11, 14)>, <0, (1, 10, 12)>, <7, (0, 5, 10)>, <10, (0, 4, 7)>, <14, (5, 8, 13)>, <4, (2, 9, 10)>, <12, (0, 8, 13)>
