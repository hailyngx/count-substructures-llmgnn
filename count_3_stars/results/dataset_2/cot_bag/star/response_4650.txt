Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 10) (12, 3) (13, 18) (0, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to find the total number of 3-stars.

We notice that node 14 has 5 neighbors (17, 1, 7, 15, 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Similarly, node 17 also has 5 neighbors (14, 0, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors (11, 12, 8, 19, 2), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors (10, 9, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (10, 11, 4, 16), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (11, 1, 3, 16), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (11, 18, 15), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 2 neighbors (9, 13), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (14, 17, 1, 3), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (10, 4, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (14, 2), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors (10, 16), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors (14, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 2 neighbors (10, 3), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 13 has 1 neighbor (18), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 0 has 1 neighbor (17), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors (8, 6, 19), so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 46 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
<14, (17, 1, 7)>
<14, (17, 1, 15)>
<14, (17, 1, 5)>
<14, (17, 7, 15)>
<14, (17, 7, 5)>
<14, (17, 15, 5)>
<17, (14, 1, 7)>
<17, (14, 1, 15)>
<17, (14, 1, 5)>
<17, (14, 7, 15)>
<17, (14, 7, 5)>
<17, (14, 15, 5)>
<10, (11, 12, 8)>
<10, (11, 12, 19)>
<10, (11, 12, 2)>
<10, (11, 8, 19)>
<10, (11, 8, 2)>
<10, (11, 19, 2)>
<11, (10, 12, 8)>
<11, (10, 12, 19)>
<11, (10, 12, 2)>
<11, (10, 8, 19)>
<11, (10, 8, 2)>
<11, (10, 19, 2)>
<8, (10, 11, 4)>
<8, (10, 11, 16)>
<8, (10, 11, 8)>
<8, (11, 4, 16)>
<6, (11, 1, 16)>
<9, (11, 18, 15)>
<7, (14, 17, 1)>
<7, (14, 17, 3)>
<7, (14, 1, 3)>
<7, (17, 1, 3)>
<2, (10, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<15, (14, 4, 9)>
<16, (8, 6, 19)>

Thus, the final answer is [46].
