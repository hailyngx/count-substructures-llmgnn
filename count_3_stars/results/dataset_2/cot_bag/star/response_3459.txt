Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
Let's first create the graph based on the given information:

There are 15 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
There are 60 edges between these nodes.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 11, 12}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {4, 9, 11, 13}
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 8, 14}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 9, 13, 14}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 7, 10}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 8, 13}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 12}
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 11, 12}
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {6, 12, 14}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 9, 13}
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {2, 8, 9, 10}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 11}
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 10, 5}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form 15 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 can form 5 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 15 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 4, 14)>
- <1, (6, 10, 14)>
- <1, (8, 11, 14)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (10, 11, 14)>
- <1, (4, 8, 11)>
- <1, (6, 8, 10)>
- <1, (10, 11, 13)>
- <1, (4, 11, 14)>
- <1, (4, 8, 14)>
- <1, (4, 6, 10)>
- <1, (8, 10, 11)>
- <1, (8, 10, 14)>
- <9, (3, 11, 13)>
- <9, (5, 11, 12)>
- <9, (2, 11, 13)>
- <9, (3, 9, 12)>
- <9, (5, 9, 12)>
- <9, (2, 9, 11)>
- <9, (3, 11, 9)>
- <9, (9, 11, 13)>
- <9, (2, 9, 12)>
- <11, (1, 2, 13)>
- <11, (3, 9, 13)>
- <11, (1, 9, 11)>
- <11, (3, 9, 11)>
- <11, (1, 2, 9)>
- <11, (1, 3, 13)>
- <11, (1, 9, 13)>
- <11, (2, 9, 13)>
- <11, (1, 2, 11)>
- <11, (1, 3, 9)>
‹/br›
So, the final answer is: [53] <1, (0, 4, 14)>, <1, (6, 10, 14)>, <1, (8, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 8, 11)>, <1, (6, 8, 10)>, <1, (10, 11, 13)>, <1, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 8, 14)>, <1, (4, 6, 10)>, <1, (8, 10, 11)>, <1, (8, 10, 14)>, <9, (3, 11, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 12)>, <9, (2, 11, 13)>, <9, (3, 9, 12)>, <9, (5, 9, 12)>, <9, (2, 9, 11)>, <9, (3, 11, 9)>, <9, (9, 11, 13)>, <9, (2, 9, 12)>, <11, (1, 2, 13)>, <11, (3, 9, 13)>, <11, (1, 9, 11)>, <11, (3, 9, 11)>, <11, (1, 2, 9)>, <11, (1, 3, 13)>, <11, (1, 9, 13)>, <11, (2, 9, 13)>, <11, (1, 2, 11)>, <11, (1, 3, 9)>
