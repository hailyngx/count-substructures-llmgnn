Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors (5, 9, 4, 11, 0, 12). We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 11:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 12:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Since each 3-star is counted twice in the calculations above (once for each leaf node), we need to divide the total count by 2 to avoid double-counting. 

Adding all the 3-star counts: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48\)

Thus, there are 48 3-stars in the graph: [48].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 11)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<11, (5, 1, 4)>
