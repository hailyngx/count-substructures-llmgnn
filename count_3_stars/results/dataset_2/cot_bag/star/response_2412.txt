Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 10) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 20) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (18, 26) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 24) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 4) (20, 0) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 19) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 5) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 6) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 3) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 25) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 27) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 0) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 29) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 3) (27, 1) (27, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's analyze each node to see which nodes it is connected to:

- Node 0: 4, 20, 24, 29, 2
- Node 1: 17, 19, 27
- Node 2: 4, 11, 22, 0
- Node 3: 21, 24, 6
- Node 4: 7, 12, 2, 20
- Node 5: 17, 19
- Node 6: 7, 23, 3
- Node 7: 4, 9, 6, 14
- Node 8: 10, 24
- Node 9: 10, 26, 7
- Node 10: 9, 11, 8
- Node 11: 10, 24, 19, 13, 2
- Node 12: 4, 22, 25
- Node 13: 11, 23
- Node 14: 7, 15, 29
- Node 15: 14, 17, 21
- Node 16: 28
- Node 17: 15, 1, 24, 5
- Node 18: 26, 22
- Node 19: 17, 11, 1, 5, 22
- Node 20: 4, 0
- Node 21: 26, 15, 3
- Node 22: 18, 2, 19, 12
- Node 23: 25, 13, 6
- Node 24: 11, 8, 0, 17, 3
- Node 25: 23, 12
- Node 26: 18, 21, 9
- Node 27: 1, 28
- Node 28: 16, 27
- Node 29: 0, 14

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 24, and 26

Applying the formula for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45\)

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 12, 22)>, <4, (0, 2, 20)>, <4, (7, 12, 22)>, <4, (7, 20, 0)>, <7, (6, 14, 15)>, <7, (9, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 12, 22)>, <7, (4, 20, 0)>, <9, (10, 26, 18)>, <11, (2, 19, 5)>, <11, (13, 23, 6)>, <11, (2, 19, 1)>, <11, (2, 19, 5)>, <11, (3, 24, 8)>, <11, (3, 24, 17)>, <14, (7, 15, 29)>, <17, (5, 19, 22)>, <17, (1, 19, 5)>, <17, (1, 27, 28)>, <17, (24, 17, 5)>, <19, (1, 5, 27)>, <19, (1, 5, 17)>, <19, (22, 2, 11)>, <19, (22, 12, 25)>, <19, (11, 2, 0)>, <24, (3, 24, 8)>, <24, (3, 24, 17)>, <24, (0, 24, 17)>, <24, (17, 5, 19)>, <26, (18, 22, 2)>
