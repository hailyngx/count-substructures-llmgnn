Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 1 has 5 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 6 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>
