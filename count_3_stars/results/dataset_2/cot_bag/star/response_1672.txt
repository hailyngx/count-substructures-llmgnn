Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (11, 29) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 28) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 23) (0, 1) (20, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (28, 12) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 21) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 16) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 22) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 2) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 2) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 18) (26, 8) (26, 5) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 5) (15, 13) (2, 21) (2, 1) (2, 5) (23, 27) (23, 21) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 18) (14, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (16, 29) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 20) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 21) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. 

We can list the unique 3-stars as follows: 
<9, 11, 16>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 11, 16>, <9, 16, 14>, <10, 12, 24>, <17, 13, 5>, <17, 13
15>, <17, 13, 18>, <17, 1, 2>, <21, 28, 29>, <21, 28, 6>, <21, 28, 23>, <21, 23, 27>, <22, 20
6>, <22, 20, 17>, <22, 20, 10>, <22, 7, 8>, <24, 18, 19>, <29, 6, 28>, <29, 6, 17>, <29, 6, 22>.
