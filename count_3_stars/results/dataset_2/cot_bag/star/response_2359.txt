Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (2, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 17) (3, 18) (1, 18) (1, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 6, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 8, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 10, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 13, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 14, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 15, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 17, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>
- For node 18, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <>

Adding up all these, we get a total of 36 3-stars within this graph. 
So, the final number to put inside the brackets is 36.
