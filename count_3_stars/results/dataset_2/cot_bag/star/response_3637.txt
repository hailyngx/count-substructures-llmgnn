Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), 
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0), 
(6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), 
(1, 3), (1, 7), 
(3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), 
(4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 3), 
(7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), 
(2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), 
(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0), 
(0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 8)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 8) -> [1]
<0, (9, 3, 8)>

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 7) -> [0]

Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8) -> [1]
<2, (9, 6, 3)>

Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4) -> [1]
<3, (6, 1, 0)>

Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 3) -> [0]

Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4) -> [1]
<5, (9, 6, 8)>

Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8) -> [2]
<6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (2, 9, 8)>

Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8) -> [0]

Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0) -> [1]
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0) -> [1]
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
