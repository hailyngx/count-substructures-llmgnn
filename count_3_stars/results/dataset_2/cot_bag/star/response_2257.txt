Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 14) (21, 23) (28, 12) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 22) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 24) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (8, 15) (8, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 29) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 12) (10, 26) (10, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 24) (16, 6) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (2, 23) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 23) (7, 20) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 11) (0, 29) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 6) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 18) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 29) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 3) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 22, 26

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all these, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
