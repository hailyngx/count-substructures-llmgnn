Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {5, 1, 3, 2}
- 1: {2, 4, 0}
- 2: {5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- 3: {7, 0, 6, 2, 1, 4}
- 4: {9, 1, 3, 8}
- 5: {6, 2, 8, 0}
- 6: {5, 3, 7}
- 7: {9, 3, 6}
- 8: {5, 9, 4, 2}
- 9: {8, 4, 2, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.
    - <0, (1, 3, 2)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (3, 2, 5)>
    
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 1.
    - <1, (2, 4, 0)>
    
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
    - <2, (5, 9, 1)>
    - <2, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <2, (5, 9, 4)>
    - <2, (5, 9, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (5, 1, 4)>
    - <2, (5, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (5, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 4)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (9, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 4, 8)>
    
- The rest of the nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 20] = 25.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 2)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (3, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
