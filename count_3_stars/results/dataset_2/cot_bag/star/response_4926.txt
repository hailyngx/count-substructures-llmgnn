Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 11 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 6, 9, 4, 8, 7, 12, 2, 3, 11, 0, and 10. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (9, 7, 3)>
  - <6, (9, 2, 13)>
  - <6, (7, 9, 11)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 12)>
  - <6, (3, 2, 4)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 10)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (6, 11, 14)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 13)>
  - <9, (6, 14, 8)>
  - <9, (7, 11, 4)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (5, 11, 2)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (5, 14, 3)>
  - <8, (5, 14, 10)>
  - <8, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (6, 9, 8)>
  - <7, (6, 8, 12)>
  - <7, (9, 12, 1)>
  - <7, (12, 0, 5)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <12, (7, 0, 3)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (6, 8, 12)>
  - <3, (6, 0, 10)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <11, (9, 4, 1)>
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (7, 12, 3)>
  - <0, (7, 3, 5)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <10, (3, 13, 14)>
  - <10, (3, 5, 0)>
  - <10, (5, 14, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
