Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 9) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 6) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 17) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for the nodes having three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 38 \)

Hence, there are 38 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the number of 3-stars is given by [38],
and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (8, 11, 18)>, 
<3, (5, 10, 18)>, 
<5, (2, 12, 18)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 13)>, 
<8, (1, 14, 19)>,
<10, (0, 9, 3)>, 
<12, (5, 13, 14)>, 
<18, (1, 5, 17)>, 
<19, (4, 12, 15)>.
