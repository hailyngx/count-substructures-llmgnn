Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 5, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, and 13. Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 11, 4, 7.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (9, 11, 8)>, <5, (9, 11, 4)>, <5, (9, 11, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (11, 8, 4)>, <5, (11, 8, 7)>, <5, (11, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>

2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 13, 10, 1, 3.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <4, (5, 13, 10)>, <4, (5, 13, 1)>, <4, (5, 13, 3)>, <4, (5, 10, 1)>, <4, (5, 10, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (13, 10, 1)>, <4, (13, 10, 3)>, <4, (13, 1, 3)>, <4, (10, 1, 3)>

3. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 12, 0, 11, 14.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <7, (5, 12, 0)>, <7, (5, 12, 11)>, <7, (5, 12, 14)>, <7, (5, 0, 11)>, <7, (5, 0, 14)>, <7, (5, 11, 14)>, <7, (12, 0, 11)>, <7, (12, 0, 14)>, <7, (12, 11, 14)>, <7, (0, 11, 14)>

4. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 2, 10, 13.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (5, 2, 10)>, <9, (5, 2, 13)>, <9, (5, 10, 13)>, <9, (2, 10, 13)>

5. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 3, 8, 13.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <10, (9, 4, 3)>, <10, (9, 4, 8)>, <10, (9, 4, 13)>, <10, (9, 3, 8)>, <10, (9, 3, 13)>, <10, (9, 8, 13)>, <10, (4, 3, 8)>, <10, (4, 3, 13)>, <10, (4, 8, 13)>, <10, (3, 8, 13)>

6. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 13.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <11, (5, 7, 13)>

7. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 14, 0, 6.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <12, (7, 14, 0)>, <12, (7, 14, 6)>, <12, (7, 0, 6)>, <12, (14, 0, 6)>

8. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 3, 6.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <0, (7, 12, 3)>, <0, (7, 12, 6)>, <0, (7, 3, 6)>, <0, (12, 3, 6)>

9. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 10, 11, 6.
   The number of 3-stars formed around node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <13, (9, 4, 10)>, <13, (9, 4, 11)>, <13, (9, 4, 6)>, <13, (9, 10, 11)>, <13, (9, 10, 6)>, <13, (9, 11, 6)>, <13, (4, 10, 11)>, <13, (4, 10, 6)>, <13, (4, 11, 6)>, <13, (10, 11, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57

The final answer is [57].
