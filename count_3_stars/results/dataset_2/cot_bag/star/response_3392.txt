Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
There are six nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
The neighbors of node 4 are 7, 0, and 6.
So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 0, 6)>.

For node 5:
The neighbors of node 5 are 10, 11, 13, 6, 2, and 14.
There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
<5, (10, 11, 13)>, <5, (10, 11, 6)>, <5, (10, 11, 2)>, <5, (10, 11, 14)>, <5, (10, 13, 6)>, <5, (10, 13, 2)>, <5, (10, 13, 14)>, <5, (10, 6, 2)>, <5, (10, 6, 14)>, <5, (10, 2, 14)>, <5, (11, 13, 6)>, <5, (11, 13, 2)>, <5, (11, 13, 14)>, <5, (11, 6, 2)>, <5, (11, 6, 14)>, <5, (11, 2, 14)>, <5, (13, 6, 2)>, <5, (13, 6, 14)>, <5, (13, 2, 14)>, <5, (6, 2, 14)>.

The same logic will be applied to nodes 6, 7, 10, and 13.

For node 6:
There is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (4, 10, 11)>.

For node 7:
There is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (4, 1, 14)>.

For node 10:
There is 1 3-star with node 10 as the center: <10, (5, 13, 14)>.

For node 13:
There is 1 3-star with node 13 as the center: <13, (8, 5, 9)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars for the given graph is [1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 24.
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <5, (10, 11, 13)>, <5, (10, 11, 6)>, <5, (10, 11, 2)>, <5, (10, 11, 14)>, <5, (10, 13, 6)>, <5, (10, 13, 2)>, <5, (10, 13, 14)>, <5, (10, 6, 2)>, <5, (10, 6, 14)>, <5, (10, 2, 14)>, <5, (11, 13, 6)>, <5, (11, 13, 2)>, <5, (11, 13, 14)>, <5, (11, 6, 2)>, <5, (11, 6, 14)>, <5, (11, 2, 14)>, <5, (13, 6, 2)>, <5, (13, 6, 14)>, <5, (13, 2, 14)>, <5, (6, 2, 14)>, <6, (4, 10, 11)>, <7, (4, 1, 14)>, <10, (5, 13, 14)>, <13, (8, 5, 9)>.
