Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 4) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 4) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 12) (16, 4) (14, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 7) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 11, 4)>, <4, (0, 12, 16)>, <5, (7, 11, 19)>, <7, (5, 13, 18)>, <8, (3, 13, 14)>, <9, (7, 10, 15)>, <10, (9, 11, 19)>, <12, (3, 17, 18)>, <13, (7, 8, 19)>, <15, (1, 9, 17)>, <17, (12, 15, 18)>, <19, (4, 6, 13)>.
