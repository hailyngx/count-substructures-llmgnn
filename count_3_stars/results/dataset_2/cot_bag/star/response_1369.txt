Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
