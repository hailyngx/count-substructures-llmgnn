Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 14) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 27) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 20) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 28) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 1) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 20) (26, 23) (26, 24) (26, 0) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 20) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 2) (18, 25) (18, 27) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 24) (16, 10) (21, 12) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 19) (29, 15) (29, 1) (14, 6) (14, 27) (20, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (20, 1) (2, 7) (2, 28) (2, 0) (19, 25) (19, 1) (17, 15) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 16) (5, 4) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 26
- Node 1: 12, 19, 20, 29
- Node 2: 0, 7, 28
- Node 3: 15, 22
- Node 4: 0, 8, 10, 11, 28, 5
- Node 5: 4, 11
- Node 6: 14
- Node 7: 2, 9, 12, 27
- Node 8: 4, 13, 16, 25
- Node 9: 7, 10, 17, 22
- Node 10: 4, 9, 16, 24
- Node 11: 4, 5, 20
- Node 12: 1, 7, 21
- Node 13: 8, 27
- Node 14: 6, 27
- Node 15: 3, 17, 29
- Node 16: 8, 10, 23, 24
- Node 17: 9, 15
- Node 18: 25, 27
- Node 19: 1, 25
- Node 20: 1, 11, 23, 24
- Node 21: 12
- Node 22: 3, 9, 28
- Node 23: 16, 20, 26
- Node 24: 10, 16, 20, 26
- Node 25: 8, 18, 19
- Node 26: 0, 23, 24
- Node 27: 7, 13, 14, 18
- Node 28: 2, 4, 11, 22
- Node 29: 1, 15

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets [] is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (12, 19, 29)>, <4, (8, 11, 28)>, <7, (9, 27, 12)>, <8, (13, 16, 25)>, <9, (10, 22, 17)>, <10, (4, 16, 24)>, <16, (8, 20, 24)>, <20, (11, 23, 24)>, <22, (3, 9, 28)>
