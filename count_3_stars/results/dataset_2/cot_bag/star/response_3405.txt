Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 10}
- Node 3: {10, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 13}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 10+4+4+10+10+10+10+10 = [68] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<0, (6, 13, 14)>
<0, (7, 13, 14)>
<0, (6, 13, 0)>
<0, (6, 14, 0)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 13)>
<1, (8, 9, 13)>
<6, (9, 13, 14)>
<7, (4, 8, 12)>
<7, (8, 10, 12)>
<8, (4, 7, 10)>
<9, (6, 10, 14)>
<10, (7, 8, 12)>
<12, (4, 11, 12)>
