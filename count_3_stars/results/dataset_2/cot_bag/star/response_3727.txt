Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
There are 11 nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying  \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
7. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
10. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 51 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 13>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 11>, <9, 7, 10>, <6, 9, 12>, <12, 5, 13>, <7, 10, 2>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 7>, <7, 5, 10>, <7, 5, 13>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 11>, <10, 5, 7>, <10, 5, 1>, <13, 5, 7>, <13, 5, 12>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 1, 14>, <11, 9, 8>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 12>, <0, 8, 3>, <4, 3, 12>, <1, 13, 10>, <2, 10, 11>, <12, 6, 13>
