Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 6, 10, 13, and 0.
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 1, 10, 12, and 8.
- Node 4 has neighbors 9, 6, 0, and 14.
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 2, 8, and 3.
- Node 7 has neighbors 9, 6, 1, and 13.
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 6, 4, 10, 1, and 7.
- Node 10 has neighbors 9, 3, 11, 13, and 2.
- Node 12 has neighbors 1, 3, and 14.
- Node 13 has neighbors 10, 2, 7, 0.
- Node 14 has neighbors 8, 12, 0, and 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9:  \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 10, 13)>
<3, (1, 8, 10)>
<4, (6, 9, 12)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<10, (3, 9, 11)>
<12, (1, 3, 14)>
<13, (0, 2, 7)>
<14, (0, 4, 8)>
