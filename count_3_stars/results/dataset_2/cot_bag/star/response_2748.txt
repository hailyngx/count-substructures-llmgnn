Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors
- Node 14: has 5 neighbors
- Node 16: has 4 neighbors
- Node 18: has 4 neighbors
- Node 19: has 4 neighbors
- Node 21: has 3 neighbors
- Node 22: has 4 neighbors
- Node 23: has 4 neighbors
- Node 24: has 4 neighbors
- Node 25: has 4 neighbors
- Node 26: has 4 neighbors
- Node 28: has 3 neighbors
- Node 29: has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 10, 25)>
<3, (12, 22, 26)>
<5, (10, 16, 29)>
<10, (0, 5, 24)>
<14, (7, 25, 29)>
<16, (2, 22, 29)>
<18, (8, 13, 27)>
<19, (1, 9, 27)>
