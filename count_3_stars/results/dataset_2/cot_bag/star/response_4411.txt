Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 7, 12, 14, 2, 8, 13, 1, 6, 10, and 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives \( 35 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 101 \). Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [101].

The unique 3-stars are:
