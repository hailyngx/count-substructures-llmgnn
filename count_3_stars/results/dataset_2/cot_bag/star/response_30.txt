Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 0, 7, 1, 13, 17, 16, 18, 9, 11, 14, 12, 3.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are [37] unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: <5, (6, 11, 14)>, <6, (2, 16, 4)>, <0, (11, 18, 12)>, <7, (16, 13, 5)>, <13, (17, 9, 7)>, <17, (9, 8, 13)>, <16, (7, 6, 4)>, <18, (9, 19, 0)>, <9, (1, 17, 13)>, <12, (5, 14, 19)>, <3, (6, 19, 4)>.
