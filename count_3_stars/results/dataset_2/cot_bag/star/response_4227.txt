Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 13)
(1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 14)
(2, 3), (2, 10), (2, 11)
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 10)
(4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 0)
(5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 1)
(6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 0)
(7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 14)
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 11), (8, 13)
(9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)
(10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 6), (10, 5)
(11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 8)
(13, 0), (13, 8), (13, 14)
(14, 1), (14, 7), (14, 13)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph based on the criteria mentioned earlier.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 74

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (4, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <0, (6, 9, 10)>, <0, (6, 9, 11)>, <0, (6, 9, 0)>, <0, (6, 10, 11)>, <0, (6, 10, 0)>, <0, (6, 11, 0)>, <4, (9, 3, 5)>, <4, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (9, 6, 10)>, <4, (9, 6, 11)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (3, 5, 10)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 9, 0)>, <4, (6, 10, 0)>, <4, (6, 11, 0)>, <9, (3, 5, 10)>, <9, (6, 7, 10)>, <9, (6, 10, 11)>, <9, (6, 10, 0)>, <9, (6, 11, 0)>, <3, (5, 10, 1)>, <3, (4, 5, 1)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (10, 1, 14)>, <5, (11, 1, 14)>, <5, (11, 4, 1)>, <5, (11, 4, 3)>, <5, (11, 4, 5)>, <5, (11, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 7)>, <6, (9, 10, 11)>, <6, (9, 10, 0)>, <6, (9, 11, 0)>, <9, (10, 7, 14)>, <9, (10, 7, 6)>, <9, (10, 11, 0)>, <9, (10, 6, 7)>, <9, (10, 6, 11)>, <10, (7, 14, 1)>, <10, (7, 6, 1)>, <10, (6, 1, 14)>, <10, (6, 1, 5)>, <10, (6, 2, 3)>, <11, (2, 3, 4)>, <11, (5, 3, 4)>
