Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 53

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
