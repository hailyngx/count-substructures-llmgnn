Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 4.
For node 5:
The node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 4, 0, and 7.
Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars at this node.

For node 4:
The node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 5, 2, and 3.
Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars at this node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10] = 20 \).
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 2)>
<4, (6, 5, 3)>
<4, (9, 5, 2)>
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
<4, (5, 2, 3)>
