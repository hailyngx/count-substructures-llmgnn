Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 8)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (Nodes 5, 3, 6, 4, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 6, 8, 7)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (Nodes 5, 1, 2, 8, 4)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (Nodes 9, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (Nodes 9, 6, 1, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 5, 1, 2, 4)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (Nodes 5, 9, 2, 8)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 2, 0, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 5, 4, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \)

Putting the final count inside brackets: [40]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 1, 8)>
- <5, (9, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
