Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 19) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 17) (6, 7) (9, 18) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 1) (19, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 8) (12, 4) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18.  
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 35

So, the total number of 3-stars is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 11, 15)>
<0, (1, 5, 15)>
<0, (11, 5, 15)>
<1, (0, 3, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 19)>
<4, (2, 5, 15)>
<4, (5, 12, 15)>
<5, (0, 4, 15)>
<6, (7, 17, 6)>
<13, (1, 14, 16)>
<15, (0, 11, 17)>
<18, (9, 16, 17)>
