Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 4, 8, 16, 18, 1, 6, 7, 15, 13, 3, 5, 17, 9, 10, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars. (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<4, (1, 15, 18)>
<16, (7, 11, 14)>
<18, (2, 4, 17)>
<1, (4, 6, 19)>
<6, (1, 13, 19)>
<7, (3, 8, 16)>
<15, (4, 5, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 15)>
<3, (7, 11, 19)>
<5, (0, 10, 11)>
<17, (8, 11, 18)>
<9, (2, 13, 14)>
<19, (1, 3, 6)>
