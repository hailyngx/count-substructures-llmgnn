Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 19) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 7) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.
For each of these nodes, we will use \( \binom{k}{3} \), where \( k \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
