Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 23) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 17) (13, 26) (13, 24) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 0) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 15) (29, 17) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 0) (24, 6) (24, 13) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 22) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 22) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 27) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 23) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 23) (27, 11) (27, 20) (27, 22) (27, 28) (18, 17) (18, 5) (10, 16) (10, 20) (10, 28) (23, 1) (23, 25) (23, 28) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 with neighbors 3, 5, 20, 23
- Node 4 with neighbors 8, 11, 14
- Node 5 with neighbors 1, 18, 22, 26
- Node 6 with neighbors 9, 19, 24
- Node 8 with neighbors 4, 17, 25
- Node 9 with neighbors 6, 12, 19, 25
- Node 10 with neighbors 16, 20, 28
- Node 11 with neighbors 4, 16, 27
- Node 12 with neighbors 7, 9, 21
- Node 14 with neighbors 0, 4, 15, 26
- Node 15 with neighbors 14, 17, 20, 21, 29
- Node 16 with neighbors 2, 10, 11
- Node 20 with neighbors 1, 7, 10, 15, 27
- Node 22 with neighbors 5, 19, 27
- Node 23 with neighbors 1, 25, 28
- Node 25 with neighbors 8, 9, 23
- Node 26 with neighbors 5, 13, 14
- Node 27 with neighbors 11, 20, 22, 28
- Node 28 with neighbors 10, 23, 27

Applying the calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 48, which we write as [48].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
