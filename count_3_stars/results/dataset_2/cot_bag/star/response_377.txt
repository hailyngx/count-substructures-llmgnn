Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees higher or equal to 3 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <1, (2, 12, 13)>, <1, (12, 13, 18)>, <1, (2, 13, 18)>, <1, (12, 1, 13)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <2, (1, 17, 9)>, <2, (17, 9, 1)>, <2, (1, 9, 2)>, <2, (17, 1, 4)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so <3, (10, 16, 19)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <4, (6, 14, 17)>, <4, (14, 17, 19)>, <4, (6, 17, 4)>, <4, (14, 13, 4)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <10, (3, 7, 13)>, <10, (7, 13, 19)>, <10, (3, 19, 10)>, <10, (7, 10, 13)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <12, (0, 1, 8)>, <12, (11, 1, 12)>, <12, (1, 8, 12)>, <12, (11, 0, 12)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <13, (1, 10, 15)>, <13, (10, 14, 15)>, <13, (1, 12, 13)>, <13, (10, 15, 18)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <14, (6, 15, 19)>, <14, (4, 15, 14)>, <14, (6, 4, 14)>, <14, (15, 13, 14)>
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <15, (14, 18, 13)>, <15, (14, 13, 15)>, <15, (13, 10, 15)>, <15, (14, 15, 18)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so <16, (17, 3, 4)>
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <17, (16, 2, 4)>, <17, (16, 4, 17)>, <17, (2, 4, 17)>, <17, (16, 3, 17)>
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so <18, (15, 1, 8)>
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <19, (3, 10, 4)>, <19, (10, 4, 19)>, <19, (3, 4, 19)>, <19, (10, 4, 19)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [37].
