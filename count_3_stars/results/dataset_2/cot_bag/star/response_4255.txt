Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be visualized as:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 3), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 13), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 12), (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 8), (8, 13), (8, 11), (13, 10), (12, 5), (12, 0), (2, 14), (0, 2), (0, 14), (14, 11), (14, 10)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Considering each node:
Node 0: has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 12, 2), so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] 3-stars.
Node 1: has 5 neighbors (3, 6, 5, 10, 12), so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]] 3-stars.
Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 3: has 5 neighbors (4, 1, 11, 2, 8), so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]] 3-stars.
Node 4: has 5 neighbors (7, 9, 13, 0, 3), so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]] 3-stars.
Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 6: has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
Node 7: has 5 neighbors (4, 12, 0, 9, 13), so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]] 3-stars.
Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 9: has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 13, 11), so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] 3-stars.
Node 10: has 4 neighbors (1, 13, 14, 5), so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] 3-stars.
Node 11: has 4 neighbors (3, 8, 14, 9), so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] 3-stars.
Node 12: has 4 neighbors (7, 1, 5, 0), so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] 3-stars.
Node 13: has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 10, 9), so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]] 3-stars.
Node 14: has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 5, 12>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 13>
<1, 12, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 10, 13>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 13>
<3, 8, 11>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 9, 13>
<7, 9, 13>
<10, 13, 14>
<11, 9, 13>
