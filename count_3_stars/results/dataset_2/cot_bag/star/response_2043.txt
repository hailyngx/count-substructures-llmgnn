Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 59 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
