Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 3) (2, 13) (2, 25) (29, 15) (29, 24) (8, 23) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 25) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 16) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 28) (22, 14) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 25) (21, 14) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 26) (18, 26) (18, 20) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 24) (16, 27) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (25, 17) (25, 2) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 13) (9, 24) (9, 3) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 9) (11, 22) (11, 0) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 6) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 24) (24, 29) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph with its nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
- Edges: 
    - 0: {11, 19}
    - 1: {6, 16}
    - 2: {13, 25}
    - 3: {4, 9, 17}
    - 4: {3, 5, 12}
    - 5: {4, 6, 20, 23, 25}
    - 6: {1, 5, 7, 21}
    - 7: {6, 8}
    - 8: {7, 23}
    - 9: {3, 24}
    - 10: {28}
    - 11: {0, 22}
    - 12: {4, 13, 25}
    - 13: {2, 12, 26}
    - 14: {17, 21, 22}
    - 15: {16, 24, 29}
    - 16: {1, 15, 19, 27}
    - 17: {3, 14, 25}
    - 18: {20, 26}
    - 19: {0, 16, 23}
    - 20: {5, 18, 22}
    - 21: {6, 14, 26, 27}
    - 22: {11, 14, 20, 26}
    - 23: {5, 8, 19}
    - 24: {9, 15, 28, 29}
    - 25: {2, 5, 12, 13, 17}
    - 26: {13, 18, 21, 22}
    - 27: {16, 21, 28}
    - 28: {10, 24, 27}
    - 29: {15, 24}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars and list them:

Calculations:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
