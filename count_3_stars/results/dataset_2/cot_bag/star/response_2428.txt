Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 13) (3, 8) (26, 1) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 6) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 23) (29, 21) (29, 10) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 0) (27, 21) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 17) (16, 25) (16, 7) (16, 4) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 24) (28, 9) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 4) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 14) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 17) (21, 29) (21, 27) (21, 17) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 8) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 15) (18, 13) (18, 14) (10, 9) (10, 29) (15, 14) (2, 11) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 20) (6, 26) (6, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (11, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 21) (17, 11) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 14, 16, and 22.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 41 \)

In brackets: [41]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (14, 20, 25)>
- <1, (14, 5, 22)>
- <1, (14, 5, 19)>
- <1, (14, 18, 15)>
- <3, (13, 6, 26)>
- <3, (13, 18, 6)>
- <3, (13, 18, 14)>
- <5, (12, 22, 19)>
- <9, (28, 22, 19)>
- <12, (8, 28, 4)>
- <14, (18, 13, 15)>
- <16, (7, 4, 17)>
- <22, (12, 5, 19)>
- <22, (12, 8, 28)>
- <22, (12, 8, 5)>
