Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes involved in this graph are:
\[
\begin{align*}
&\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\}
\end{align*}
\]

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:
\begin{itemize}
\item Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 17, 19) \(\implies \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
\item Node 2: 5 neighbors (6, 7, 13, 15, 18) \(\implies \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
\item Node 6: 4 neighbors (3, 2, 9, 12) \(\implies \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
\item Node 11: 3 neighbors (1, 16, 18) \(\implies \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
\item Node 12: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 10) \(\implies \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
\item Node 13: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 9, 18) \(\implies \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
\item Node 15: 4 neighbors (3, 15, 17, 19) \(\implies \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
\item Node 17: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 15, 16, 18, 19) \(\implies \binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
\item Node 18: 5 neighbors (11, 13, 15, 17, 19) \(\implies \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
\item Node 19: 4 neighbors (0, 15, 18, 19) \(\implies \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
\end{itemize}

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\text{Total number of 3-stars} = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final answer is \([62]\).
Unique 3-stars in the graph:
\[
\begin{align*}
<0, (3, 17, 19)>, <2, (6, 7, 13)>, <2, (6, 13, 18)>, <2, (7, 13, 18)>, <2, (2, 6, 13)>, <2, (2, 7, 13)>, <2, (2, 6, 18)>, \\
<2, (2, 7, 18)>, <2, (6, 7, 18)>, <6, (3, 2, 12)>, <6, (2, 9, 12)>, <6, (2, 6, 12)>, <6, (5, 12, 0)>, <11, (1, 16, 18)>, <12, (0, 5, 10)>, \\
<12, (5, 6, 10)>, <12, (6, 12, 0)>, <12, (10, 12, 0)>, <13, (4, 9, 18)>, <15, (3, 17, 19)>, <15, (15, 17, 19)>, <15, (15, 18, 19)>, \\
<15, (2, 15, 17)>, <17, (0, 15, 19)>, <17, (1, 17, 16)>, <17, (15, 17, 19)>, <17, (15, 17, 18)>, <17, (15, 16, 19)>, <17, (0, 17, 1)>, \\
<18, (11, 15, 19)>, <18, (13, 15, 18)>, <18, (13, 15, 19)>, <18, (15, 17, 19)> \\
\end{align*}
