Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
In this graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 49

So, there are 49 3-stars in this graph. Listing them in unique form:
<[0, 4, 7], [0, 4, 13], [0, 4, 12], [0, 4, 10], [0, 5, 8], [0, 5, 12], [0, 5, 11], [0, 5, 2], [0, 5, 6], [5, 8, 4], [5, 8, 12], [5, 8, 12], [5, 8, 12], [5, 8, 2], [5, 8, 6], [5, 11, 12], [5, 11, 2], [5, 11, 6], [5, 12, 8], [5, 12, 12], [5, 12, 2], [5, 12, 6], [5, 12, 11], [6, 1, 9], [6, 1, 2], [6, 1, 14], [6, 1, 5], [6, 9, 2], [6, 9, 14], [6, 9, 1], [6, 9, 13], [6, 14, 2], [6, 14, 1], [6, 14, 12], [6, 14, 10], [9, 2, 6], [9, 2, 14], [9, 2, 1], [9, 2, 13], [9, 14, 6], [9, 14, 1], [9, 14, 12], [9, 14, 10], [13, 4, 7], [13, 4, 0], [13, 4, 10], [13, 4, 7], [13, 7, 4], [13, 7, 0], [13, 7, 4], [13, 9, 2], [14, 6, 1], [14, 6, 2], [14, 6, 9], [14, 6, 12], [14, 9, 2], [14, 9, 1], [14, 9, 12], [14, 9, 10]>. 

Putting the number of 3-stars inside brackets: [49].
