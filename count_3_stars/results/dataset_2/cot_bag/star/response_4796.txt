Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 24) (7, 19) (18, 23) (18, 0) (22, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 5) (20, 13) (20, 28) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (26, 3) (26, 15) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 21) (28, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 20) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 23) (27, 25) (27, 6) (11, 1) (11, 25) (11, 9) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (16, 24) (16, 23) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 17) (24, 16) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 6) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 9) (6, 27) (6, 29) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 28) (12, 9) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 0) (19, 12) 

Response:
The list of edges provided describes a total of 30 nodes labeled from 0 to 29 and a total of 90 edges connecting these nodes. 

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph by identifying the central node of each 3-star. We will then count how many 3-stars are formed using each central node.

1. Node 1: <1, (11, 16, 24)>
2. Node 2: <2, (13, 23, 4)>
3. Node 3: <3, (19, 5, 4)> and <3, (26, 15, 5)>
4. Node 4: <4, (3, 29, 2)> and <4, (29, 6, 3)>
5. Node 9: <9, (17, 11, 23)> and <9, (12, 19, 23)>
6. Node 10: <10, (22, 16, 12)>
7. Node 13: <13, (20, 5, 2)> and <13, (23, 19, 2)>
8. Node 16: <16, (1, 24, 23)>
9. Node 17: <17, (24, 8, 9)>
10. Node 19: <19, (7, 12, 0)>
11. Node 23: <23, (18, 13, 2)>
12. Node 24: <24, (7, 16, 1)>
13. Node 25: <25, (27, 11, 28)>
14. Node 26: <26, (3, 15, 5)>
15. Node 28: <28, (20, 25, 12)>
16. Node 29: <29, (4, 21, 6)>

Since each 3-star is counted for the central node and each central node can only form one unique 3-star with its neighbors, we have found a total of 16 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [16].
