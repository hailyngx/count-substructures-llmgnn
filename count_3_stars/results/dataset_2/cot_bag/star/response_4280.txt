Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors in this graph are: 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 35 = 123

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [123].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (11, 2, 12)>
<10, (1, 11, 14)>
<11, (13, 9, 7)>
<12, (0, 5, 7)>
<14, (0, 11, 4)>
