Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (19, 0) (19, 12) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (3, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 17.
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <5, (6, 13, 17)>, <5, (6, 16, 17)>, <5, (13, 16, 17)>, <5, (16, 0, 7)>

2. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <6, (5, 2, 12)>, <6, (2, 18, 12)>, <6, (12, 13, 9)>, <6, (12, 15, 19)>

3. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   <10, (11, 18, 2)>

4. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <11, (10, 9, 18)>, <11, (9, 18, 12)>, <11, (18, 6, 10)>, <11, (18, 12, 13)>

5. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <12, (11, 6, 13)>, <12, (11, 15, 19)>, <12, (6, 13, 9)>, <12, (6, 15, 19)>, <12, (13, 9, 14)>, <12, (13, 15, 9)>, <12, (13, 15, 19)>, <12, (15, 9, 19)>, <12, (15, 13, 19)>, <12, (15, 13, 12)>

6. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <13, (5, 17, 12)>, <13, (5, 12, 9)>, <13, (5, 17, 9)>, <13, (17, 1, 12)>

7. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <17, (5, 13, 1)>, <17, (13, 1, 14)>, <17, (13, 12, 1)>, <17, (1, 14, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 31. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [31].
