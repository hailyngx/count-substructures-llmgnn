Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 19) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 18) (25, 7) (25, 3) (25, 28) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 0) (13, 21) (13, 15) (13, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 24) (21, 27) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 15) (28, 25) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 20) (26, 27) (26, 22) (26, 15) (26, 20) (6, 18) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 4) (24, 14) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 11) 

Response:
There are 16 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are: 0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27, and 28. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 7.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 12.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 18.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 19.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 21.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 25.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 26.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 27.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 28.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 13, 14>, <0, 13, 21>, <0, 27, 10>, <0, 27, 13>, <0, 27, 17>, <0, 27, 26>, <3, 10, 16>, <3, 10, 25>, <3, 18, 6>, <3, 18, 14>, <4, 7, 25>, <4, 7, 17>, <4, 12, 8>, <4, 12, 11>, <7, 25, 3>, <10, 27, 21>, <13, 0, 14>, <13, 0, 21>, <13, 9, 11>, <13, 9, 3>, <14, 0, 8>, <14, 0, 18>, <14, 8, 12>, <14, 24, 4>, <15, 13, 26>, <15, 13, 21>, <15, 21, 28>, <15, 21, 26>, <16, 10, 19>, <16, 10, 25>, <17, 4, 11>, <17, 4, 27>, <18, 3, 6>, <18, 3, 28>, <18, 14, 28>, <18, 14, 6>, <19, 1, 7>
