Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (9, 18) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 10) (2, 6) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 14) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 5) (14, 12) (14, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 2) 

Response:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 11, 16, 10, 8, 17, 0, 18, 12, 19, 4: \( 9 \times \binom{3}{3} = 9 \times 1 = 9 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 13, 7, 15, 1, 5: \( 5 \times \binom{4}{3} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 9 + 20 = 29 \).

Putting the final answer inside brackets: [29].
