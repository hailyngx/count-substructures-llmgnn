Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labelled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars formed.

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4)
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 7)
  - It can form 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 7)>.

- Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9)
  - It can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>.

- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5)
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7)
  - It can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 7)>.

- Node 6: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8)
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 7: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - It can form 1 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>.

- Node 8: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
  - It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 8, 5)
  - It can form 1 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 8)>.

Since each node forms exactly 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
