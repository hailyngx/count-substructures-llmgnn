Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 4) (23, 27) (23, 22) (6, 15) (6, 28) (9, 20) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 14) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 24) (24, 26) (24, 21) (7, 18) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 21) (16, 3) (16, 29) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (11, 19) (11, 21) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 5) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 20) (13, 14) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 27, 18, 22, 25, 23, 6, 28, 19, 26, 21, 4, 12, 16, 14, 10, 29, 20, 5, 2.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 \) = 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 16, 20)>
<15, (4, 5, 6)>
<27, (22, 23, 19)>
<18, (7, 10, 21)>
<22, (18, 23, 27)>
<25, (1, 4, 5)>
<14, (2, 13, 26)>
<10, (0, 1, 18)>
<5, (3, 15, 25)>
<21, (11, 12, 28)>
<4, (0, 15, 19)>
<13, (14)>
<2, (14, 17, 20)>
