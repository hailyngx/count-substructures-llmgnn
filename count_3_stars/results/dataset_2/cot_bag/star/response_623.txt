Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
{(11, 10), (11, 7), (11, 18), (16, 19), (16, 5), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 6), (7, 11), (7, 4), (7, 14), (7, 8), (1, 15), (1, 18), (3, 14), (3, 13), (3, 12), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 2), (2, 10), (2, 5), (2, 0), (8, 7), (8, 10), (8, 14), (5, 16), (5, 2), (5, 13), (5, 12), (13, 3), (13, 5), (13, 19), (13, 6), (15, 1), (15, 9), (15, 18), (17, 0), (17, 9), (12, 4), (12, 3), (12, 5), (12, 14), (18, 11), (18, 1), (18, 15), (19, 16), (19, 13), (19, 6), (0, 2), (0, 17), (14, 7), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 12), (9, 15), (9, 17), (6, 4), (6, 13), (6, 19)}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 7, and 18: <11, (10, 7, 18)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 5, and 5: <16, (19, 5, 5)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 4, and 14: <7, (11, 4, 14)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 6: <4, (7, 12, 6)>
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 2: <10, (11, 8, 2)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 5, and 0: <2, (10, 5, 0)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 14: <8, (7, 10, 14)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 2, and 13: <5, (16, 2, 13)>
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 19: <13, (3, 5, 19)>
Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 18: <15, (1, 9, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
