Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (1, 12)
- Node 1: (3, 5, 8, 0)
- Node 2: (6, 9, 4, 7, 14, 10)
- Node 3: (1, 10, 8)
- Node 4: (6, 2)
- Node 5: (6, 1, 7, 12)
- Node 6: (9, 5, 2, 4)
- Node 7: (8, 12, 2, 5)
- Node 8: (1, 3, 13, 14, 7)
- Node 9: (6, 2, 11, 13, 12)
- Node 10: (3, 13, 14, 2)
- Node 11: (9, 13)
- Node 12: (0, 1, 7, 5, 9, 13)
- Node 13: (9, 8, 12, 11, 10, 14)
- Node 14: (8, 13, 2, 10)

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

\[ \text{3-stars on node 1: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 7)>, <1, (0, 12, 5)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 2: } \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
<2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (6, 9, 14)>, <2, (6, 4, 2)>, <2, (6, 7, 5)>, <2, (6, 7, 12)>, <2, (6, 5, 1)>, <2, (6, 5, 12)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 2, 6)>, <2, (7, 5, 1)>, <2, (7, 5, 12)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (7, 8, 1)>, <2, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (12, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 2, 6)>, <2, (14, 10, 3)>, <2, (10, 14, 8)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 3: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<3, (1, 8, 0)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 5: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<5, (6, 1, 12)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 12)>, <5, (12, 7, 8)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 6: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
<6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 7)>, <6, (9, 2, 14)>, <6, (9, 4, 6)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 7: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<7, (8, 12, 5)>, <7, (8, 12, 0)>, <7, (12, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 8: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<8, (1, 3, 10)>, <8, (1, 3, 14)>, <8, (1, 10, 13)>, <8, (1, 13, 14)>, <8, (3, 10, 14)>, <8, (13, 10, 14)>, <8, (13, 10, 2)>, <8, (14, 10, 2)>, <8, (10, 2, 6)>, <8, (10, 2, 4)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 9: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 14)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 12)>, <9, (6, 5, 1)>, <9, (2, 14, 10)>, <9, (7, 5, 1)>, <9, (7, 12, 5)>, <9, (5, 1, 3)>, <9, (12, 7, 8)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 12: } \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
<12, (0, 1, 3)>, <12, (0, 1, 8)>, <12, (0, 5, 7)>, <12, (1, 5, 7)>, <12, (1, 5, 8)>, <12, (1, 8, 13)>, <12, (5, 7, 8)>, <12, (7, 8, 13)>, <12, (7, 8, 14)>, <12, (5, 8, 13)>, <12, (5, 8, 14)>, <12, (9, 7, 8)>, <12, (9, 7, 13)>, <12, (9, 5, 1)>, <12, (13, 8, 14)>, <12, (7, 8, 14)>, <12, (13, 11, 9)>, <12, (13, 9, 6)>, <12, (13, 9, 2)>, <12, (13, 9, 7)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 13: } \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
<13, (8, 12, 7)>, <13, (8, 12, 5)>, <13, (8, 7, 5)>, <13, (8, 14, 10)>, <13, (12, 7, 5)>, <13, (12, 7, 8)>, <13, (12, 5, 1)>, <13, (7, 5, 1)>, <13, (7, 5, 6)>, <13, (5, 1, 3)>, <13, (7, 8, 14)>, <13, (12, 5, 6)>, <13, (7, 5, 6)>, <13, (5, 1, 3)>, <13, (5, 1, 8)>, <13, (5, 6, 9)>, <13, (5, 6, 2)>, <13, (5, 6, 4)>, <13, (5, 6, 7)>, <13, (5, 6, 2)>

\[ \text{3-stars on node 14: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<14, (8, 10, 2)>, <14, (8, 10, 13)>, <14, (8, 10, 3)>, <14, (10, 13, 11)>

So the total number of 3-stars is \[ [4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4] = [101]. \]
