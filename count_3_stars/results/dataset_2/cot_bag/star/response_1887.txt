Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For nodes 5, 6, and 9, we have $`\binom{4}{3} = 4`$ 3-stars each.
- For node 4, we have $`\binom{6}{3} = 20`$ 3-stars.
- For node 7, we have $`\binom{4}{3} = 4`$ 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 36$. 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [36].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (9, 6, 4)>
- <6, (5, 9, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
