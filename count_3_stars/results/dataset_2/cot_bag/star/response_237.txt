Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 6) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 26) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 27) (2, 0) (21, 12) (21, 28) (21, 15) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 25) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 3) (9, 25) (9, 8) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (4, 0) (4, 22) (4, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (24, 8) (24, 4) (11, 6) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 3) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 6) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 23) (5, 7) (23, 28) (23, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 20, 25, 10, 17, 12, 27, 28, 29, 2, 0, 21, 13, 26, 18, 8, 9, 15, 22, 4, 3, 24, 19, 6, 1, 5, 23

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1. For nodes 20, 25, 12, 27, 28, 29, 13, 26, 18, and 8, there are 4 3-stars each.
2. For nodes 10, 17, 2, 0, 21, 19, 6, and 3, there are 3 3-stars each.
3. For nodes 1 and 23, there are 2 3-stars each.
4. For nodes 15, 22, 4, 24, 5, and 9, there is 1 3-star each.

The total number of 3-stars is: [10*(inom{4}{3}) + 8*(inom{3}{3}) + 2*(inom{2}{3}) + 6*(inom{1}{3})]  
\[= [10*(4) + 8*(1) + 2*(0) + 6*(0)] = [40 + 8] = [48]\]

The unique 3-stars are:
