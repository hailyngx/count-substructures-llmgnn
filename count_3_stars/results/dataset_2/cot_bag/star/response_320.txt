Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 42 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
