Response:
The graph you provided has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's analyze the nodes to find how many 3-stars can be formed.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 77 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [77]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
