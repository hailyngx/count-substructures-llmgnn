Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 7) (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 26) (8, 6) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 19) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (14, 27) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (9, 7) (11, 7) (11, 6) (28, 6) (28, 3) (17, 23) (17, 20) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 28) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (12, 20) (12, 4) (3, 4) (3, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 4) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 25) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 10) (24, 16) (1, 14) (1, 7) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify these nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with them.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 13, 8, 27, 23, 20, 14, 4, 18, 6, 29, 10, 21, 24, 7, 5, 16, 1, 25.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 58 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<13, (6, 8, 25)>, <8, (23, 2, 26)>, <8, (13, 6, 8)>, <8, (13, 8, 23)>, <8, (23, 17, 20)>, <8, (23, 20, 7)>, <27, (15, 27, 21)>, <27, (14, 5, 27)>, <27, (14, 27, 21)>, <27, (27, 5, 15)>, <23, (8, 16, 19)>, <23, (8, 17, 20)>, <23, (17, 20, 7)>, <23, (17, 23, 8)>, <20, (7, 12, 20)>, <20, (17, 20, 29)>, <20, (29, 0, 20)>, <14, (0, 1, 14)>, <14, (0, 10, 14)>, <14, (0, 14, 27)>, <14, (1, 14, 7)>, <4, (3, 12, 4)>, <4, (4, 18, 24)>, <4, (4, 26, 8)>, <4, (4, 8, 13)>, <18, (18, 24, 29)>, <6, (11, 6, 28)>, <6, (13, 6, 8)>, <6, (6, 11, 7)>, <29, (0, 18, 29)>, <10, (10, 16, 24)>, <10, (10, 21, 27)>, <10, (10, 21, 27)>, <10, (10, 24, 14)>, <7, (1, 7, 22)>, <7, (20, 7, 29)>, <7, (7, 11, 6)>, <7, (7, 22, 13)>, <5, (2, 5, 25)>, <16, (10, 16, 24)>, <16, (16, 24, 14)>, <16, (16, 23, 10)>, <1, (1, 14, 7)>, <25, (0, 5, 25)>
