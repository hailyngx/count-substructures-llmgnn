Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 8) (11, 18) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by inspecting each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.

Adding up all the contributions, we have \(4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 40\).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 16)>
<1, (0, 6, 10)>
<2, (4, 8, 17)>
<4, (2, 5, 10)>
<5, (4, 10, 13)>
<6, (1, 8, 15)>
<7, (0, 10, 15)>
<8, (2, 6, 17)>
<10, (1, 4, 5)>
<12, (1, 9, 15)>
<14, (3, 9, 17)>
<16, (0, 6, 17)>
<17, (2, 8, 14)>
<18, (3, 10, 12)>
<19, (7, 12, 15)>
