Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 7, 11, 12, 14, 3
- Node 1: 10, 14, 6, 2, 9
- Node 2: 7, 11, 1, 6
- Node 3: 7, 8, 12, 0
- Node 4: 13
- Node 5: 7, 8, 13, 14
- Node 6: 8, 12, 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 2
- Node 8: 13, 5, 11, 6, 3
- Node 9: 10, 11, 12, 1
- Node 10: 11, 1, 9
- Node 11: 8, 10, 0, 9, 2
- Node 12: 14, 0, 6, 3, 9
- Node 13: 4, 8, 5
- Node 14: 12, 0, 1, 5

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 13, 4:
- These nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [36] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 12, 14)>, <1, (6, 9, 10)>, and <2, (6, 7, 11)>
