Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 84. Therefore, the final answer is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 3, 13)>
<2, (1, 12, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<4, (6, 11, 13)>
<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<6, (0, 12, 4)>
<8, (2, 11, 9)>
<9, (5, 10, 7)>
<12, (6, 1, 14)>
<13, (1, 0, 4)>
<14, (12, 5, 4)>
