Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 75 \).  

Therefore, there are 75 3-stars in total.  

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us  [75].  

Listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 12, 13)>, <0, (6, 12, 1)>, <0, (6, 13, 1)>, <0, (12, 13, 1)>, 
<4, (8, 13, 0)>, <4, (8, 13, 1)>, <4, (8, 13, 12)>, <4, (8, 0, 13)>, <4, (8, 0, 14)>, <4, (8, 1, 13)>, <4, (8, 14, 5)>, <4, (12, 13, 0)>, 
<6, (0, 14, 4)>, <6, (0, 14, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 11)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 7, 11)>, <6, (4, 14, 0)>, <6, (4, 14, 5)>, <6, (7, 3, 11)>, <6, (7, 5, 14)>, <6, (11, 3, 7)>,  
<9, (2, 11, 13)>, <9, (2, 13, 10)>, <9, (2, 13, 4)>, <9, (2, 13, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 12)>, <9, (2, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 13)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 1, 13)>, <9, (10, 12, 9)>, <9, (10, 13, 1)>, <9, (10, 1, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 9)>, <9, (10, 9, 13)>, <9, (12, 10, 13)>
  
Therefore, the final answer is:  
[75], <0, (6, 12, 13)>, <0, (6, 12, 1)>, <0, (6, 13, 1)>, <0, (12, 13, 1)>, 
<4, (8, 13, 0)>, <4, (8, 13, 1)>, <4, (8, 13, 12)>, <4, (8, 0, 13)>, <4, (8, 0, 14)>, <4, (8, 1, 13)>, <4, (8, 14, 5)>, <4, (12, 13, 0)>, 
<6, (0, 14, 4)>, <6, (0, 14, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 11)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 7, 11)>, <6, (4, 14, 0)>, <6, (4, 14, 5)>, <6, (7, 3, 11)>, <6, (7, 5, 14)>, <6, (11, 3, 7)>,  
<9, (2, 11, 13)>, <9, (2, 13, 10)>, <9, (2, 13, 4)>, <9, (2, 13, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 12)>, <9, (2, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 13)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 1, 13)>, <9, (10, 12, 9)>, <9, (10, 13, 1)>, <9, (10, 1, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 9)>, <9, (10, 9, 13)>, <9, (12, 10, 13)>
