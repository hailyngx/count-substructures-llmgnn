Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 19, 12. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 18, 19, 14, 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 14, 16. There is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 6, 16. No 3-star is formed with node 4.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 0. There is only 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7, 4. No 3-star is formed with node 6.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 16. There is only 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 19, 10, 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 19. There is only 1 3-star with node 10 as the center.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 5, 13, 0. There is only 1 3-star with node 11 as the center.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 10. There is only 1 3-star with node 12 as the center.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 3, 2, 11. There is only 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 18, 7, 0. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 8, 2, 15. There is only 1 3-star with node 17 as the center.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 1, 8, 2, 10, 15. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 19 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 39\]

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in the given graph.
