Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 19) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 28) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 24) (8, 21) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 18) (21, 8) (21, 26) (21, 18) (11, 28) (11, 12) (11, 15) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 22) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 27) (13, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (25, 17) (25, 23) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 27) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 1) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 24) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (2, 26) (2, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 26) (15, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (10, 23) (18, 29) (18, 21) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 17) (27, 26) (1, 5) (1, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{4} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes gives us a total of \( 1 + 4*13 = 53 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (7, 19, 20)>, <9, (5, 12, 27)>, <15, (11, 13, 26)>, <26, (2, 15, 27)>, <29, (4, 16, 18)>, and so on.
