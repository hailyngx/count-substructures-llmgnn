Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 5 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of [39] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
