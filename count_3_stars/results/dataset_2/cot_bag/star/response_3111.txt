Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 7), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 1: It has 6 neighbors (5, 9, 6, 8, 2, 7), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 2: It has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 1, 3), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 3: It has 3 neighbors (5, 2, 7), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 4: It has 3 neighbors (9, 8, 2), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 5: It has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6: It has 4 neighbors (1, 7, 8, 0), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7: It has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 0, 3, 1), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: It has 6 neighbors (9, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: It has 3 neighbors (8, 4, 1), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars possible for each node gives a total of 46 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 1)>
<8, (0, 6, 1)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (2, 0, 6)>
<8, (2, 1, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 0, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)>
