Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 12, 13}
Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 3, 11, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 2, 11, 3}
Node 11: Neighbors {9, 3, 14, 6, 8}
Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 2, 14}
Node 13: Neighbors {4, 3, 0, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
