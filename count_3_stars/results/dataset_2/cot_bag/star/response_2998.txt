Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's list them along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {6, 10, 11, 14, 2, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 3, 14, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 3, 12, 0, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 11}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 11, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 14, 1}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 0, 8, 4}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 12, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these values, we get a total of 72 3-stars. So, the final answer is [72].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 10, 14)>
<0, (6, 11, 2)>
<0, (6, 11, 13)>
<0, (10, 14, 13)>
<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<1, (5, 9, 14)>
<1, (3, 6, 14)>
<1, (3, 6, 13)>
<1, (1, 9, 14)>
<1, (1, 3, 13)>
<2, (6, 12, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 12)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<8, (5, 2, 10)>
<8, (5, 2, 11)>
<8, (10, 2, 11)>
<11, (5, 7, 8)>
<11, (5, 7, 0)>
<11, (7, 0, 8)>
<13, (1, 10, 12)>
