Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 7) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 5) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

0: 12, 16  
1: 2, 6  
2: 1, 3, 8, 15, 18  
3: 2  
4: 5, 9, 13, 19  
5: 4, 11, 12, 19  
6: 1, 9  
7: 9, 16, 17  
8: 2, 14  
9: 4, 6, 7, 13, 15, 18  
10: 11, 16  
11: 5, 10, 14, 16  
12: 0, 5, 18  
13: 4, 9, 14, 18  
14: 11, 13, 17, 8  
15: 2, 9  
16: 7, 10, 11  
17: 7, 14  
18: 2, 9, 12, 13  
19: 4, 5  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with more than three neighbors:

Node 2:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

Node 4, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18:
- Each of these nodes has exactly 4 neighbors, so each node contributes only 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars: 10 + 6 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 15, 18)>
<4, (5, 9, 19)>
<9, (6, 7, 15)>
<11, (5, 10, 14)>
<14, (8, 13, 17)>
<16, (7, 10, 11)>
<18, (2, 9, 13)>
