Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 12, 10
- Node 1: 9, 13
- Node 2: 5, 8, 12, 10, 11, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 5, 3, 6, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 11, 4
- Node 6: 5, 13, 7, 11, 4
- Node 7: 8, 6, 10
- Node 8: 5, 9, 2, 10, 7
- Node 9: 5, 8, 14, 10, 1
- Node 10: 9, 8, 13, 2, 0, 7
- Node 11: 5, 6, 2, 0, 14
- Node 12: 2, 0
- Node 13: 1, 10, 6
- Node 14: 9, 11

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 2, 5, 8, 10, and 11 each have 6 or more neighbors, thus contributing to the total 3-stars count.

- Node 2: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 2.
- Node 5: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 5.
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 8.
- Node 10: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 10.
- Node 11: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 11.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 80 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [80].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 8, 10)>, <2, (5, 10, 11)>, <5, (2, 8, 10)>, <5, (2, 10, 11)>, <8, (2, 5, 10)>, <8, (2, 5, 11)>, <10, (2, 5, 8)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>, <11, (5, 2, 10)>, <11, (5, 2, 8)>
