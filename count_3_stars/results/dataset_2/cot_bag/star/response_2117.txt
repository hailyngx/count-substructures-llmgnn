Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 17) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 10) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) 

Response:
There are some important notes to keep in mind as we proceed with this task:  
1. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 19.  
2. We need to find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.  

Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 1: Neighbors - [0, 10, 15, 18] (Degree: 4)  
Node 2: Neighbors - [5, 8, 19] (Degree: 3)  
Node 3: Neighbors - [7, 13, 15] (Degree: 3)  
Node 4: Neighbors - [9, 17] (Degree: 2)  
Node 5: Neighbors - [0, 2, 12, 17] (Degree: 4)  
Node 7: Neighbors - [3, 10, 11] (Degree: 3)  
Node 8: Neighbors - [2, 16, 17] (Degree: 3)  
Node 9: Neighbors - [4, 11, 16, 19] (Degree: 4)  
Node 10: Neighbors - [0, 1, 7, 14, 16] (Degree: 5)  
Node 11: Neighbors - [7, 9, 12] (Degree: 3)  
Node 12: Neighbors - [5, 11, 18] (Degree: 3)  
Node 13: Neighbors - [3, 17, 19] (Degree: 3)  
Node 15: Neighbors - [1, 3] (Degree: 2)  
Node 16: Neighbors - [8, 9, 10] (Degree: 3)  
Node 17: Neighbors - [4, 5, 8, 13] (Degree: 4)  
Node 18: Neighbors - [1, 12, 14] (Degree: 3)  
Node 19: Neighbors - [9, 13, 19] (Degree: 3)  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Summing up, we have \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \). So there are 22 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [22].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 10, 18)>
<1, (0, 10, 15)>
<1, (0, 10, 1)>
<1, (10, 18, 14)>
<5, (0, 2, 12)>
<5, (0, 2, 17)>
<5, (0, 12, 18)>
<5, (0, 17, 4)>
<9, (4, 11, 19)>
<9, (11, 12, 18)>
<9, (11, 16, 8)>
<9, (11, 16, 19)>
<10, (0, 1, 14)>
<10, (0, 1, 15)>
<10, (0, 1, 18)>
<10, (0, 7, 3)>
<10, (1, 14, 18)>
<10, (1, 14, 7)>
<10, (1, 15, 3)>
<10, (1, 18, 12)>
<10, (7, 3, 13)>
<10, (7, 3, 15)>
