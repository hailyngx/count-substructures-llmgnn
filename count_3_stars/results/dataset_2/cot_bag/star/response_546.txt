Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph, so we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on those nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

1. Node 1 has neighbors {8, 14, 11, 6, 5}, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has neighbors {8, 6, 10, 3}, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has neighbors {4, 2, 11, 9, 5}, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has neighbors {8, 12, 10, 6, 3}, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 3, 1, 10}, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has neighbors {4, 8, 2, 1, 10}, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has neighbors {7, 0, 3, 11, 12, 10}, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 11 has neighbors {3, 1, 9, 12}, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 12 has neighbors {4, 13, 11, 9}, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 14 has neighbors {8, 13, 1}, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 77 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 77. 

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (8, 14, 11)> <1, (8, 14, 6)> <1, (8, 14, 5)> <1, (8, 11, 6)> <1, (8, 11, 5)> <1, (8, 6, 5)> <1, (14, 11, 6)> <1, (14, 11, 5)> <1, (14, 6, 5)> <1, (11, 6, 5)> <2, (8, 6, 10)> <2, (8, 6, 3)> <2, (8, 10, 3)> <2, (6, 10, 3)> <3, (4, 2, 11)> <3, (4, ...
