Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes above gives a total of 80 3-stars (4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 12, 13)>
<1, (6, 7, 11)>
<2, (0, 8, 13)>
<3, (4, 8, 10)>
<4, (3, 7, 11)>
<5, (6, 7, 13)>
<6, (1, 5, 12)>
<7, (4, 5, 13)>
<8, (3, 2, 10)>
<9, (1, 4, 11)>
<10, (3, 8, 1)>
<11, (9, 1, 4)>
<12, (0, 6, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>
<14, (0, 4, 13)>
