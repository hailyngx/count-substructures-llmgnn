Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 1}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 5, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 4, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 3, 0}

Now we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Count of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
