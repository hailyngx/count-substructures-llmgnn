Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 17) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 25) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 17) (0, 28) (0, 29) (7, 26) (7, 28) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 18) (10, 20) (27, 9) (27, 4) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 26) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 19) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 29) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 16) (2, 17) (25, 13) (25, 22) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 17) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 16) (19, 1) (19, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 5, 13, 22, 23, 4, 8, 21, 28, 11, 7, 1, 15, 29, 20, 27, 12, 6, and 16.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
1. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
4. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
9. Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
12. Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
13. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
14. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
15. Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
16. Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
17. Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
18. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
19. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
20. Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is: [52]
