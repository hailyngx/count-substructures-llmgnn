Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (10, 4) (10, 18) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 18) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will consider each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {11, 7, 2, 19}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {8, 1, 6, 4}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {11, 14, 19}
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {2, 10}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {11, 14, 0}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {8, 13, 2, 15}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {14, 13, 1}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {13, 2, 6}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {11, 12, 18}
Node 10 has 2 neighbors: {4, 18}
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {3, 1, 9, 5, 11}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {14, 8, 7, 6}
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {17, 3, 7, 13, 5}
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {16, 19, 6}
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {0, 10, 19, 9}
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {3, 18, 15, 1}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].
