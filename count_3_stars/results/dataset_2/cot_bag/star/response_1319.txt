Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 1) (7, 13) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 5) (8, 26) (23, 9) (23, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 22) (19, 2) (15, 25) (15, 29) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 21) (4, 9) (12, 23) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 28) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 24) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 25) (26, 8) (26, 20) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 6) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 24) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 29) (16, 18) (18, 27) (18, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 11) (25, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 4+4+4+1+1+4+1+1+4+1+1+4+10+10+1+1+1+10+10+1+4+1+4+1 = 83 \).

Therefore, there are 83 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:
\[ [83] \]
The unique 3-stars are: 
\[ <0, (11, 13, 27)> \]
\[ <1, (0, 11, 7)> \]
\[ <2, (12, 24, 28)> \]
\[ <3, (5, 10, 12)> \]
\[ <4, (9, 21, 12)> \]
\[ <5, (3, 17, 5)> \]
\[ <6, (2, 6, 14)> \]
\[ <7, (1, 13, 21)> \]
\[ <9, (4, 6, 23)> \]
\[ <10, (1, 3, 17)> \]
\[ <11, (0, 1, 25)> \]
\[ <12, (2, 17, 23)> \]
\[ <21, (4, 20, 22)> \]
\[ <22, (19, 23, 24)> \]
\[ <24, (1, 22, 25)> \]
\[ <25, (11, 15, 24)> \]
