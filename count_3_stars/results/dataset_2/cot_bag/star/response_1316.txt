Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 2
- Node 1: 9, 3, 0, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 0
- Node 3: 1, 7, 0
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 9, 6, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 7, 2, 0
- Node 7: 9, 6, 3, 4, 2
- Node 8: 1, 4, 2
- Node 9: 5, 1, 7, 0

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 34

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 3, 2)>
<0, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 2)>
