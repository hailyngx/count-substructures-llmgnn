Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars it can form:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [20]
Node 2: [5]
Node 3: [4]
Node 4: [0]
Node 5: [20]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [20]
Node 8: [4]
Node 9: [10]

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [85].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 1, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 0, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (2, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 1)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
