Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are some nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars. Let's identify these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes based on their number of neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 12, 15)>
<1, (0, 8, 12)>
<5, (3, 10, 11)>
<6, (10, 11, 13)>
<9, (4, 10, 19)>
<13, (2, 6, 15)>
<14, (9, 16, 17)>
<17, (6, 14, 19)>
<19, (9, 14, 0)>
