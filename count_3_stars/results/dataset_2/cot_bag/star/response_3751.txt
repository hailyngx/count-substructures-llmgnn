Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 9)>

- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 2)>
    - <3, (5, 9, 2)>
    - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 9, 0)>
    - <3, (6, 9, 5)>
    - <3, (6, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (6, 2, 0)>
    - <3, (9, 8, 0)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <4, (5, 8, 3)>

- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <5, (2, 6, 1)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 3)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 0)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (2, 1, 3)>
    - <5, (2, 1, 6)>
    - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <6, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 1)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 9, 1)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (2, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (9, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (9, 5, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <6, (5, 9, 2)>
    - <6, (5, 3, 2)>
    - <6, (9, 3, 2)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <8, (3, 9, 4)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <9, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [ 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 ] = [66]
