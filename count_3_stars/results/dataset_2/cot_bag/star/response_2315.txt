Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 6) (5, 21) (5, 16) (6, 23) (6, 11) (6, 19) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 23) (4, 27) (4, 25) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 13) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 28) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 10) (15, 26) (15, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 20) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (16, 25) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 20) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 0) (17, 0) (26, 29) (26, 15) (2, 27) (2, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 21) (19, 6) (19, 24) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 19) (13, 18) (13, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 8) (8, 22) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 25) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, which are: 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, and 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 81 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is represented as [81].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 17, 21)>, <0, (3, 17, 20)>, <0, (3, 17, 21)>, <0, (3, 20, 21)>, <0, (14, 17, 22)>, <0, (14, 21, 22)>, <0, (14, 17, 20)>, <0, (14, 21, 20)>, <4, (23, 27, 25)>, <6, (11, 7, 9)>, <8, (15, 11, 25)>, <10, (1, 2, 24)>, <16, (21, 5, 28)>, <20, (12, 21, 28)>, <25, (8, 18, 28)>
