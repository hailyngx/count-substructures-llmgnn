Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's see how many 3-stars are formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 11)>  
- Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 12)>  
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 13)>  
- Node 6: <6, (1, 5, 9)>  
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 11)>  
- Node 9: <9, (6, 7, 10)>  
- Node 10: <10, (6, 9, 1)>  
- Node 11: <11, (1, 7, 13)>  
- Node 12: <12, (4, 13, 14)>  
- Node 13: <13, (5, 11, 12)>  
- Node 14: <14, (8, 12, 13)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
