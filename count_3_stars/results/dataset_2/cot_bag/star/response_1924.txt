Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 9) (10, 7) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 29) (11, 13) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 9) (2, 26) (2, 16) (6, 17) (6, 7) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (23, 27) (23, 10) (23, 19) (16, 2) (21, 20) (21, 4) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 20) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 17) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 28) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 1) (29, 8) (24, 15) (24, 20) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 29) (0, 12) (0, 26) (0, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 14) (20, 21) (20, 14) (20, 24) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 25) (4, 5) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (3, 26) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
\[ \binom{18}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 816\]

So, there are a total of 816 3-stars in this graph.

Putting this number in brackets, we get: [816]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (12, 17, 26)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 26)>,
<4, (5, 21, 25)>,
<5, (1, 3, 17)>,
<8, (14, 15, 29)>,
<10, (7, 14, 29)>,
<12, (0, 9, 15)>,
<13, (11, 22, 25)>,
<14, (7, 8, 10)>,
<15, (12, 24, 27)>,
<17, (5, 6, 19)>,
<19, (17, 23, 28)>,
<20, (14, 21, 24)>,
<23, (10, 19, 27)>,
<26, (0, 2, 3)>,
<27, (15, 23, 29)>,
<28, (8, 19, 9)>,
<29, (1, 10, 27)>,
<13, (4, 11, 22)>.
