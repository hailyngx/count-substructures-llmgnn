Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
1: (7, 3)
2: (4, 7, 3, 6, 8)
3: (1, 4, 2, 8)
4: (9, 7, 8, 6, 3, 2)
5: (8, 0)
6: (9, 4, 2, 0)
7: (9, 4, 1, 2)
8: (5, 9, 4, 3, 2)
9: (6, 8, 4, 7, 0)
0: (5, 9, 6)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 40 3-stars: [40].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 7, 4)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<8, (9, 2, 4)>
<8, (5, 0, 2)>
<8, (5, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 0, 8)>
