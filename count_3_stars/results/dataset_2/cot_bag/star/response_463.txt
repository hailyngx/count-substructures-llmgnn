Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (9, 8, 6, 3, 1). Total number of 3-stars around node 0 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (5, 7, 8, 0). Total number of 3-stars around node 1 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 7). Total number of 3-stars around node 2 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (4, 8, 6, 0). Total number of 3-stars around node 3 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (7, 8, 3, 2). Total number of 3-stars around node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (2, 8, 1, 7). Total number of 3-stars around node 5 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9, 4, 2, 1). Total number of 3-stars around node 7 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1). Total number of 3-stars around node 8 = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (8, 7, 0, 5). Total number of 3-stars around node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 57

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (9, 8, 6)>, <0, (9, 8, 3)>, <0, (9, 8, 1)>, <0, (9, 6, 3)>, <0, (9, 6, 1)>, <0, (9, 3, 1)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (7, 8, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>, <3, (8, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (8, 3, 2)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (8, 1, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>.
