Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {10, 8, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 11, 8, 13, 4}
- Node 3: {12, 5, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {11, 14, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {8, 13, 1}
- Node 8: {10, 7, 12, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {14, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 11, 8, 2}
- Node 11: {6, 10, 5, 2}
- Node 12: {14, 3, 8, 1}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 7, 2}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 1, 5}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].
