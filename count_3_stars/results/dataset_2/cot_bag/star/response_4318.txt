Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \]

Therefore, there are 52 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
