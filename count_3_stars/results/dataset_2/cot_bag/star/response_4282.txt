Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have more than three neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: There are 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars for node 0 are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>.

- For node 1: There are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-star for node 1 is <1, (0, 3, 6)>.

- For node 2: There are 3 neighbors (8, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). The unique 3-star for node 2 is <2, (7, 8, 9)>.

- For node 3: There are 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-star for node 3 is <3, (0, 1, 7)>.

- For node 4: There are 5 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars for node 4 are <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>.

- For node 5: There are 4 neighbors (4, 6, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-star for node 5 is <5, (4, 6, 9)>.

- For node 6: There are 3 neighbors (0, 1, 5). So, the number of 3-stars with 6 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). The unique 3-star for node 6 is <6, (0, 1, 5)>.

- For node 7: There are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars for node 7 are <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>.

- For node 8: There are 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5). So, the number of 3-stars with 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). The unique 3-star for node 8 is <8, (0, 2, 5)>.

- For node 9: There are 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 7). So, the number of 3-stars with 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars for node 9 are <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Adding up all these 3-star counts, we have a total of 57 3-stars in this graph: \[ [57] \]
