Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 6) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 18) (13, 0) (5, 4) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8 => [1] 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 17, 12, 18, 19, 14 => 5 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 17, 4 => [1] 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 9, 5 => 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 10, 16, 14 => [1] 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 12, 11, 9 => [1] 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 17, 16 => [1] 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 10, 7, 4 => [1] 3-star
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 9, 6 => [1] 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 7, 19, 15 => [1] 3-star
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7 => No 3-star
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 15 => [1] 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 17, 11, 14, 4 => 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 8, 0, 6 => [1] 3-star
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 3, 10, 8, 2, 15 => 5 3-stars
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 2, 13 => No 3-star
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 2, 11 => No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (17, 12, 18)>, <2, (17, 12, 19)>, <2, (17, 18, 19)>, <2, (17, 19, 14)>, <4, (3, 9, 15)>, <4, (3, 5, 15)>, <4, (9, 5, 15)>, <6, (10, 14, 16)>, <7, (7, 9, 12)>, <8, (1, 16, 17)>, <10, (10, 16, 17)>, <11, (11, 14, 15)>, <15, (2, 14, 15)>, <17, (2, 15, 17)>, <17, (2, 15, 11)>, <17, (2, 15, 14)>, <17, (2, 15, 4)>, <17, (11, 14, 15)>, <17, (15, 14, 4)>, <17, (15, 4, 11)>, <17, (15, 4, 14)>, <17, (4, 14, 15)>, <17, (4, 15, 11)>, <17, (4, 15, 14)>, <17, (4, 11, 15)>, <17, (4, 15, 2)>, <17, (4, 2, 11)>, <17, (4, 2, 15)>
