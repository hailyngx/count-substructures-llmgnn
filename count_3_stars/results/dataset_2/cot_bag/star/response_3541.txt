Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Here is the list of unique 3-stars and the final count:

1. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (3, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (2, 6, 9)>
6. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
7. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 3)>
9. <9, (2, 3, 7)>

There are [9] total 3-stars in the given graph.
