Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: This node has 3 neighbors.
2. Node 2: This node has 4 neighbors.
3. Node 3: This node has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors.
5. Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors.
6. Node 9: This node has 4 neighbors.
7. Node 11: This node has 4 neighbors.
8. Node 12: This node has 4 neighbors.
9. Node 15: This node has 2 neighbors.
10. Node 17: This node has 3 neighbors.
11. Node 18: This node has 4 neighbors.
12. Node 19: This node has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 32, and we represent them in the form of unique 3-stars:
\[ [32] \]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 8, 13)>, <2, (12, 14, 15)>, <3, (1, 5, 18)>, <4, (11, 16, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 12)>, <9, (12, 18, 19)>, <11, (2, 16, 17)>, <12, (2, 5, 9)>, <15, (2, 7, 17)>, <17, (7, 11, 19)>, <18, (1, 3, 9)>, <19, (2, 9, 17)>
