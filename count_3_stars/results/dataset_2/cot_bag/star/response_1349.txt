Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (15, 13) (15, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 14) (13, 15) (13, 19) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 19) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: 3  
Node 1: 4  
Node 2: 3  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 3  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 4  
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 3  
Node 9: 5  
Node 10: 3  
Node 11: 3  
Node 12: 2  
Node 13: 2  
Node 14: 3  
Node 15: 2  
Node 16: 4  
Node 17: 3  
Node 18: 3  
Node 19: 3  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we find:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{19} \binom{d_i}{3} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3}\times3 + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4\times3 + 10 = 1 + 12 + 10 = 23 \]

So, there are 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
\[ [23] \]
<0, (6, 9, 18)>, <1, (3, 9, 17)>, <5, (6, 7, 16)>, <9, (1, 6, 11)>, <16, (3, 5, 18)>, <3, (1, 14, 17)>, <19, (7, 13, 17)>, <7, (5, 16, 19)>, <12, (9, 11, 14)>, <14, (3, 11, 12)>, <13, (7, 15, 19)>, <17, (1, 3, 19)>, <2, (4, 8, 10)>, <4, (2, 15, 18)>, <6, (0, 5, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 3)>, <10, (2, 6, 16)>, <11, (1, 14, 9)>, <15, (4, 13, 16)>, <18, (0, 5, 16)>
