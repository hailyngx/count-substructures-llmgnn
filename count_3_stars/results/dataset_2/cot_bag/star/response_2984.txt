Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (1, 26) (1, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 22) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 27) (26, 4) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 4) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 2) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 23) (19, 14) (19, 12) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 0) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 25) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 22) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (20, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 26) (4, 5) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 8) (18, 21) (18, 13) (18, 20) (23, 28) (23, 27) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <2, (1, 5, 25)>
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <3, (6, 15, 16)>, <3, (14, 15, 28)>, <3, (5, 13, 25)>, <3, (9, 12, 26)>
4. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <5, (2, 13, 25)>
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <6, (3, 11, 14)>
7. Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
8. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <8, (0, 12, 21)>, <8, (12, 0, 8)>, <8, (8, 12, 21)>, <8, (11, 21, 8)>
9. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <9, (7, 12, 16)>
10. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <10, (17, 26, 29)>
11. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <12, (0, 9, 12)>, <12, (8, 9, 12)>, <12, (12, 0, 8)>, <12, (12, 13, 19)>
12. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) = <13, (18, 22, 28)>, <13, (5, 13, 18)>, <13, (12, 13, 19)>, <13, (13, 18, 28)>, <13, (12, 13, 9)>, <13, (15, 16, 28)>, <13, (13, 15, 28)>, <13, (5, 13, 25)>, <13, (14, 18, 22)>, <13, (13, 15, 5)>
13. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <14, (3, 6, 22)>, <14, (14, 6, 22)>, <14, (14, 19, 22)>, <14, (3, 14, 22)>
14. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <15, (3, 13, 16)>, <15, (7, 13, 29)>, <15, (15, 7, 29)>, <15, (15, 13, 28)>
15. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <16, (3, 15, 28)>, <16, (9, 15, 16)>, \<16, (16, 15, 28)>, <16, (16, 3, 15)>
16. Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
17. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <18, (13, 20, 28)>
18. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <22, (14, 17, 22)>
19. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <25, (2, 5, 27)>
20. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) = <26, (4, 5, 26)>, <26, (10, 17, 26)>, <26, (1, 10, 26)>, <26, (26, 10, 29)>
21. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <28, (13, 16, 23)>
22. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) = <29, (7, 10, 25)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 45
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 45 [45].
