Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
5. Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 8, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 5 \times 10 + 1 \times 4 = 50 + 4 = 54 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
