Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 10, 11, 2, 8, 0, 7, 9, 4, 12, 14, 3, 5, 6, 1, and 13.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes based on their degree:
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 83 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 83. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [83]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<10, (11, 5, 13)>, <10, (3, 9, 13)>, <10, (6, 8, 11)>, <10, (2, 12, 6)>, <10, (5, 0, 3)>, <10, (10, 6, 8)>, <10, (10, 2, 12)>, <10, (11, 10, 6)>, <10, (11, 5, 0)>, <10, (11, 13, 6)>, <11, (10, 12, 13)>, <11, (13, 12, 3)>, <11, (5, 8, 6)>, <11, (11, 8, 9)>, <2, (10, 12, 0)>, <8, (11, 9, 1)>, <0, (3, 5, 4)>, <9, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (12, 14, 1)>, <4, (3, 14, 1)>, <12, (10, 14, 4)>, <12, (2, 0, 14)>, <14, (4, 12, 6)>, <3, (10, 9, 13)>, <3, (0, 5, 4)>, <3, (3, 13, 6)>, <5, (10, 1, 5)>, <6, (10, 8, 6)>, <6, (8, 7, 14)>, <6, (2, 14, 1)>, <1, (9, 4, 14)>, <13, (11, 12, 6)>.
