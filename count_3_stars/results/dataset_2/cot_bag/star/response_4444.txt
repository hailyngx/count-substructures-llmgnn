Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 23) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 10) (14, 26) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 9) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 28) (18, 2) (18, 5) (28, 6) (28, 23) (28, 16) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 20) (26, 14) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (16, 17) (16, 28) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 29) (10, 0) (10, 5) (15, 24) (15, 21) (19, 1) (19, 11) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 12) (3, 20) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 13) (20, 6) (20, 22) (20, 3) (21, 15) (24, 27) (24, 15) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
We first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: 4, 26, 10, 11  
Node 1: 6, 5, 13, 19  
Node 2: 29, 18, 22  
Node 3: 17, 23, 12, 20  
Node 4: 7, 27, 12, 0  
Node 5: 6, 18, 1, 10  
Node 6: 9, 28, 1, 20  
Node 7: 4, 23, 25  
Node 8: 23, 26  
Node 9: 6, 29  
Node 10: 0, 29, 5  
Node 11: 22, 25, 0, 13, 19  
Node 12: 4, 5, 3  
Node 13: 1, 11  
Node 15: 24, 21  
Node 16: 17, 28  
Node 17: 3, 26, 16  
Node 18: 2, 5  
Node 19: 1, 11  
Node 20: 6, 22, 3  
Node 22: 2, 11, 20  
Node 23: 7, 9, 8, 3, 28  
Node 24: 27, 15  
Node 25: 7, 29, 11  
Node 26: 14, 17, 8, 0  
Node 27: 4, 24  
Node 28: 6, 23, 16  
Node 29: 9, 2, 25, 10  

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed for each node that has three or more neighbors:  

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node gives a total of 55 3-stars.  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, 4, 10, 26>  
<1, 5, 6, 19>  
<1, 5, 6, 10>  
<1, 5, 10, 18>  
<1, 6, 13, 19>  
<1, 6, 13, 11>  
<1, 19, 11, 13>  
<3, 12, 4, 5>  
<3, 12, 4, 20>  
<3, 20, 22, 11>  
<3, 20, 23, 28>  
<4, 0, 26, 27>  
<7, 25, 11, 29>  
<17, 3, 23, 26>
