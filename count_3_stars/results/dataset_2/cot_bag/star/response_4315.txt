Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 11, and 17. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors - 7, 11, and 17. So, it forms 1 3-star.

2. Node 11: Node 11 has 5 neighbors - 0, 4, 18, 19, and 5. So, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 17: Node 17 has 4 neighbors - 1, 4, 12, and 9. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (7, 11, 17)>, <11, (0, 18, 19)>, <17, (1, 12, 9)>.
