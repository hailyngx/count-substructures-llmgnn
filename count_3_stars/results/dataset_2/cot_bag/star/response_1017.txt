Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze the nodes and their connections to identify nodes that can form 3-stars. Let's start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 3
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 8, 5, 13
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 12, 11
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 8, 0, 10
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 13, 11, 10
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 12, 1, 4, 0
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 14, 7, 12, 13
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 14, 10, 3, 1
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 11, 10, 0
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 9, 8, 7, 3, 14, 4
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 9, 2, 4
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 5, 14, 3
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 1, 14
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 13, 12, 10

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- By applying \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up these results, we get a total of 70 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [70]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, 9, 5>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 11, 4>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 0, 10>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 11>, <4, 5, 10>, <5, 12, 1>, <5, 12, 4>, <5, 12, 0>, <6, 14, 7>, <6, 14, 12>, <6, 14, 13>, <8, 2, 14>, <8, 2, 10>, <8, 2, 1>, <8, 12, 3>, <8, 12, 14>, <8, 12, 1>, <8, 3, 10>, <8, 1, 13>, <9, 11, 2>, <10, 9, 8>, <10, 9, 7>, <10, 9, 4>, <10, 9, 3>, <10, 9, 14>, <10, 9, 4>, <10, 8, 7>, <10, 8, 3>, <10, 8, 14>, <10, 8, 4>, <10, 7, 3>, <10, 7, 14>, <10, 7, 4>, <11, 9, 4>, <12, 6, 2>, <12, 6, 5>, <12, 6, 13>, <12, 2, 14>, <12, 2, 3>, <12, 5, 14>, <12, 3, 14>, <13, 6, 4>, <13, 6, 1>, <13, 4, 1>, <13, 4, 11>, <13, 1, 14>, <14, 8, 13>, <14, 8, 12>, <14, 8, 10>, <14, 8, 4>, <14, 13, 6>, <14, 13, 4>, <14, 13, 12>, <14, 12, 6>, <14, 12, 3>, <14, 12, 10>.
