Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 14: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 64

So, there are total [64] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (13, 4, 14)>, <0, (13, 14, 5)>, <0, (10, 13, 4)>, <0, (10, 13, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 11)>, <4, (2, 10, 0)>, <4, (11, 7, 4)>, <4, (11, 0, 14)>, (7, 10, 3), <7, (2, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 1, 11)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <10, (8, 6, 1)>, <10, (8, 6, 7)>, <10, (8, 3, 10)>, <10, (6, 1, 7)>, <10, (6, 1, 11)>, <10, (6, 2, 7)>, <10, (6, 0, 10)>, <14, (13, 8, 10)>, <14, (13, 8, 12)>, <14, (13, 0, 14)>, <14, (0, 10, 12)>, <14, (3, 10, 14)>
