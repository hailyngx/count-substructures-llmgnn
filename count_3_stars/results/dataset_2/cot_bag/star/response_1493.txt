Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph with 20 nodes labeled from 0 to 19 and the corresponding edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Edges: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10)
```

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3 has neighbors: 9, 7, 0, 14, 1, 10. Hence, it can form 15 3-stars.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 8, 15, 17. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 15 + 1 = 16. Thus, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-star configurations are:

- <3, (9, 7, 0)>
- <3, (9, 7, 14)>
- <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- <3, (9, 7, 10)>
- <3, (9, 0, 1)>
- <3, (9, 0, 14)>
- <3, (9, 0, 10)>
- <3, (9, 14, 1)>
- <3, (9, 14, 10)>
- <3, (9, 1, 10)>
- <3, (7, 0, 14)>
- <3, (7, 0, 1)>
- <3, (7, 0, 10)>
- <3, (7, 14, 1)>
- <3, (7, 14, 10)>
- <3, (0, 1, 14)>
- <6, (4, 8, 15)>
