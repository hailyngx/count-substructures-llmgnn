Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 27) (17, 11) (17, 4) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (12, 10) (12, 2) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 21) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 6) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 28) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 24) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 4) (22, 19) (22, 27) (0, 1) (0, 4) (16, 24) (16, 21) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 4) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 29) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (18, 14) (18, 23) (18, 15) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 22) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 15) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 29) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37 \). Thus, there are [37] 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 12, 24)>, <2, (5, 13, 24)>, <2, (5, 15, 24)>, <2, (12, 15, 24)>, <2, (2, 12, 15)>, <2, (2, 24, 15)>, <2, (24, 4, 17)>, <2, (24, 4, 21)>, <2, (24, 11, 21)>, <2, (24, 11, 16)>, <2, (24, 11, 29)>, <4, (17, 24, 27)>, <4, (17, 22, 27)>, <4, (17, 27, 14)>, <4, (17, 27, 22)>, <4, (17, 27, 10)>, <4, (22, 27, 14)>, <4, (22, 27, 10)>, <4, (10, 27, 14)>, <4, (27, 14, 10)>, <4, (27, 10, 22)>, <6, (10, 8, 14)>, <6, (10, 14, 18)>, <6, (8, 14, 18)>, <13, (1, 2, 9)>, <13, (1, 9, 28)>, <13, (1, 9, 13)>, <13, (1, 13, 23)>, <13, (9, 28, 26)>, <13, (9, 13, 23)>, <13, (28, 26, 21)>, <13, (28, 3, 7)>, <13, (23, 7, 5)>
