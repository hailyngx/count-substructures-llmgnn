Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 6: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 8: C(6, 3) = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
