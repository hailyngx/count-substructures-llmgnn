Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {4, 2, 7}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 3}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 4, 3}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {9, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 2}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, and <9, (5, 6, 4)>.
