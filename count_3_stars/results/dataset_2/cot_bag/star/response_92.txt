Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 3, 10, 11, 4, 8, 5, 13, 0, 2, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
5. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes is 82.

Therefore, the answer is [82].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (14, 9, 13)>
<9, (2, 14, 3)>
<10, (11, 12, 5)>
<11, (10, 5, 13)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (6, 10, 4)>
<5, (10, 13, 8)>
<13, (11, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<12, (1, 10, 4)>
