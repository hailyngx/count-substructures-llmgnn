Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes with their neighbors to analyze:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8} (Degree: 4)
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (Degree: 5)
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (Degree: 5)
- Node 3: {0, 7} (Degree: 2)
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9} (Degree: 4)
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 9} (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 8} (Degree: 4)
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 9} (Degree: 4)
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6} (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7} (Degree: 4)

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [48] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<1, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (9, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 5, 9)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
