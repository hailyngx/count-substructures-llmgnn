Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with neighbors 3, 8, 10, 11
- Node 1 with neighbors 9, 11, 12, 13
- Node 2 with neighbors 4, 6, 7, 12
- Node 4 with neighbors 2, 5, 11, 14
- Node 6 with neighbors 2, 10, 12, 13
- Node 9 with neighbors 0, 1, 3, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

So, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 10)>
<0, (3, 8, 11)>
<0, (3, 10, 11)>
<0, (8, 10, 11)>
<1, (9, 11, 12)>
<1, (9, 11, 13)>
<1, (9, 12, 13)>
<1, (11, 12, 13)>
<2, (4, 6, 12)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<2, (6, 7, 12)>
<4, (2, 5, 14)>
<4, (2, 11, 14)>
<4, (5, 11, 14)>
<4, (11, 2, 14)>
<6, (2, 10, 12)>
<6, (2, 13, 12)>
<6, (10, 13, 12)>
<6, (2, 12, 13)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 10)>
<9, (0, 3, 10)>
<9, (3, 8, 10)>
