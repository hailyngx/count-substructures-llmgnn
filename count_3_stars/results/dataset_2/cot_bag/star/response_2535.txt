Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 27) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 28) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 24) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 13) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 25) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 26) (8, 22) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 5) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 1) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 12) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 1) (3, 28) (19, 2) (19, 11) (23, 14) (23, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 20) (0, 6) (0, 11) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 27) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 22) (5, 25) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 5) (15, 13) (15, 24) (27, 9) (27, 1) (24, 10) (24, 21) (24, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 10, 26, 16, 27
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 29, 8, 19, 25
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 18, 5, 25
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 17, 4, 22, 25
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 2, 16, 26, 22
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 14, 11, 1, 24, 16
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, 19, 0, 12
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 6, 17, 11, 20
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 23, 20, 10
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 7, 4, 26, 23
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 5
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 7, 18, 8, 13, 1
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 29, 3, 13
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 2, 28

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula discussed earlier:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 55 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 10, 16>, <1, 10, 26>, <1, 16, 26>, <2, 8, 19>, <2, 8, 25>, <2, 19, 25>, <4, 5, 25>, <5, 17, 25>, <8, 16, 26>, <10, 11, 16>, <10, 11, 19>, <10, 14, 20>, <10, 16, 26>, <11, 12, 17>, <11, 16, 26>, <14, 20, 23>, <18, 23, 26>, <18, 23, 4>, <18, 23, 7>, <22, 5, 6>.
