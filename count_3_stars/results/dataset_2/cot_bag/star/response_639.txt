This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 17) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 15) (7, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 11) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 4) (26, 25) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (20, 21) (20, 10) (2, 17) (2, 16) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (16, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 14) (23, 26) (23, 10) (23, 9) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 4) (28, 5) (6, 17) (6, 4) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 6) (9, 23) (9, 24) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 20) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 28) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars.   
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.   

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
6. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
7. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
13. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the nodes, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 64 \).   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 64, which can be represented as [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:   
<0, 5, 28>  
<1, 8, 13>  
<8, 13, 15>  
<13, 8, 15>  
<15, 11, 26>  
<15, 26, 11>  
<16, 2, 17>  
<17, 2, 16>  
<18, 5, 19>  
<19, 4, 18>  
<21, 17, 25>  
<25, 21, 17>  
<26, 11, 15>  
<28, 0, 5>
