Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. 

Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 4, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 8, 12, 2
Node 2 has neighbors: 11, 8, 5, 1, 13
Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 7
Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 8, 13
Node 5 has neighbors: 11, 7, 2, 13, 14
Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 3, 4, 0
Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 11, 12, 3, 5
Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 2, 0, 1
Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 0
Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 0, 4, 14
Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 7, 13, 5, 12, 2
Node 12 has neighbors: 11, 7, 13, 1
Node 13 has neighbors: 11, 4, 12, 2, 5
Node 14 has neighbors: 10, 5

Based on the given information, the total number of 3-stars formed within this graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<2, (11, 13, 5)>
<4, (6, 10, 13)>
<5, (11, 13, 14)>
<7, (11, 5, 13)>
<11, (7, 12, 13)>
