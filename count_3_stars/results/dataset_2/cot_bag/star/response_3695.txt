Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 13
- Node 1: 0, 8, 10, 11, 12
- Node 2: 0, 11
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9, 12
- Node 4: 7, 8, 10
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 12
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 11
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 11, 12
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 10: 0, 1, 4, 9, 13
- Node 11: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 12: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 13: 0, 9, 10
- Node 14: 9

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all the possible 3-stars gives us a total of [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>, <0, (1, 10, 13)>, <0, (1, 12, 13)>, <0, (6, 10, 12)>, <0, (6, 10, 13)>, <0, (6, 12, 13)>, <1, (9, 10, 13)>, <3, (5, 7, 12)>, <9, (10, 11, 13)>, <9, (10, 11, 14)>
