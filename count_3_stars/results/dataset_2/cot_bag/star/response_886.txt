Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 19) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 18) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) 

Response:
There are 11 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each, total of 24 3-stars
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: there's exactly 1 3-star each, total of 4 3-stars
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 24 + 4 = 28. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 19)>, <1, (9, 15, 18)>, <2, (9, 14, 17)>, <3, (0, 4, 16)>, <4, (0, 8, 14)>, <8, (0, 4, 19)>, <9, (1, 2, 19)>, <11, (6, 12, 17)>, <13, (6, 7, 18)>, <14, (2, 4, 16)>, <19, (0, 8, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
