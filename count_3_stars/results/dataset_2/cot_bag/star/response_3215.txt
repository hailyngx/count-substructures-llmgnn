Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 27) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (14, 28) (17, 20) (17, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 11) (13, 10) (15, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 29) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 15) (27, 29) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (4, 8) (4, 28) (11, 13) (11, 28) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (20, 17) (20, 29) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 20) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 18) (12, 16) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 16) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 23) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 28) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 23) (23, 6) (23, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 1, 21, 8, 13, 15, 27, 0, 4, 11, 28, 7, 25, 29, 16, 19, 12, 24, 3, 6, 5, 10, 2.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 9, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 26, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For nodes 1 and 21, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
For nodes 8, 13, 15, 27, 0, 4, 11, 28, 7, 25, 29, 16, 19, 12, 24, 3, 6, 5, 10, and 2, we have no 3-stars formed since they all have less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 \).
Thus, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars are listed as follows: <9, (26, 18, 24)>, <9, (26, 27, 29)>, <9, (8, 13, 21)>, <9, (8, 18, 15)>, <9, (8, 27, 15)>, <26, (9, 27, 29)>, <26, (27, 8, 29)>, <1, (21, 13, 2)>, <21, (1, 13, 2)>, <1, (21, 5, 0)>, <21, (1, 5, 0)>.
