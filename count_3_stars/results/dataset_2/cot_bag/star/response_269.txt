Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go node by node to count the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <3, (25, 7, 20)>, <3, (25, 7, 28)>, <3, (25, 20, 28)>, <3, (7, 20, 28)>.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (27, 18, 20)>, <4, (27, 16, 18)>, <4, (27, 16, 20)>, <4, (18, 16, 20)>.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <7, (15, 3, 24)>, <7, (15, 9, 24)>, <7, (3, 9, 24)>, <7, (3, 2, 24)>, <7, (9, 2, 24)>, <7, (15, 24, 7)>, <7, (3, 20, 24)>, <7, (20, 14, 28)>, <7, (3, 20, 28)>, <7, (20, 14, 28)>.

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <9, (27, 18, 21)>, <9, (27, 18, 21)>, <9, (27, 7, 21)>, <9, (27, 7, 21)>, <9, (18, 21, 29)>, <9, (7, 21, 29)>, <9, (18, 21, 12)>, <9, (7, 21, 29)>, <9, (18, 12, 29)>, <9, (21, 12, 29)>.

Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <12, (29, 5, 26)>, <12, (18, 5, 26)>, <12, (29, 26, 21)>, <12, (18, 26, 21)>.

Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <16, (27, 4, 24)>.

Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <18, (4, 27, 9)>, <18, (4, 27, 12)>, <18, (27, 9, 12)>, <18, (4, 9, 12)>.

Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <19, (25, 23, 11)>, <19, (25, 23, 10)>, <19, (25, 11, 10)>, <19, (23, 11, 10)>, <19, (23, 11, 5)>, <19, (25, 10, 2)>, <19, (23, 10, 2)>, <19, (25, 11, 2)>, <19, (23, 11, 2)>, <19, (10, 2, 11)>.

Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <20, (3, 4, 14)>, <20, (3, 4, 10)>, <20, (4, 14, 10)>, <20, (3, 14, 10)>.

Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <21, (23, 29, 26)>, <21, (23, 29, 21)>, <21, (29, 26, 12)>, <21, (23, 26, 12)>.

Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <23, (8, 19, 21)>.

Node 24 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <26, (29, 6, 12)>, <26, (29, 21, 6)>, <26, (29, 6, 5)>, <26, (21, 12, 5)>.

Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <27, (4, 9, 5)>, <27, (4, 9, 18)>, <27, (4, 5, 5)>, <27, (9, 18, 5)>.

Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <28, (8, 14, 29)>, <28, (3, 14, 29)>, <28, (8, 3, 29)>, <28, (8, 14, 3)>.

Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <29, (28, 12, 14)>, <29, (28, 21, 14)>, <29, (28, 12, 21)>, <29, (12, 5, 14)>, <29, (21, 26, 12)>, <29, (12, 26, 5)>, <29, (21, 26, 5)>, <29, (12, 5, 21)>, <29, (12, 21, 14)>, <29, (5, 26, 21)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [45].
