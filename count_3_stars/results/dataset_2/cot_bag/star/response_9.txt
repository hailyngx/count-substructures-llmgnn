Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors in this graph are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: [10 choose 3] = 120
- Node 9: [10 choose 3] = 120

Total number of 3-stars: 120 + 120 = 240

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
