Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, 1, 8, 13>
2. <0, 2, 12, 4>
3. <0, 7, 4, 12>
4. <0, 10, 5, 9>
5. <0, 13, 11, 1>
6. <2, 12, 4, 1>
7. <2, 7, 8, 4>
8. <2, 13, 11, 6>
9. <4, 11, 5, 9>
10. <5, 9, 10, 0>
11. <6, 13, 11, 14>
12. <9, 10, 7, 4>
