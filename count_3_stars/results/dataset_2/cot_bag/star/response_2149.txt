Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
The list of edges provided helps us visualize the graph better. Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 11, 6
- Node 1 has neighbors: 7, 3, 6, 2, 12
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 4, 1, 11, 13, 14
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 14, 6, 2
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 0
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 4, 6, 1, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, 3
- Node 9 has neighbors: 8, 7, 13, 0
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 3, 10, 14
- Node 13 has neighbors: 9, 10, 2
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 4, 10, 2, 12

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 74, which we represent as [74].
