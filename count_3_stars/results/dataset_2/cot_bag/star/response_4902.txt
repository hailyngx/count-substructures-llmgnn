Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the given edges, the graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1 is connected to: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2 is connected to: 6, 7
- Node 3 is connected to: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4 is connected to: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6 is connected to: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to: 4, 7
- Node 9 is connected to: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as:
\[ [] = \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 68 \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 68, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
