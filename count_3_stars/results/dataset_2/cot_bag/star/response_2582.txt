Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, there are 52 unique 3-stars in this graph, or in other notation, there are 52 3-stars present in the graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [52]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 14>
<1, 7, 14>
<4, 7, 11>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 6, 12>
<5, 9, 12>
<6, 8, 10>
<8, 10, 12>
<4, 8, 12>
<4, 8, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<0, 11, 12>
<1, 13, 14>
<4, 12, 14>
