Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 23) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 16) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 28) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 24) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 14) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 29) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 16) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 15) (6, 23) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 20) (28, 9) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 3) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (11, 27) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 20) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 29) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 10) (20, 4) (20, 28) (20, 24) (20, 10) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 10) (0, 25) (12, 21) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up.

Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 25)>
<4, (1, 7, 25)>
<4, (20, 24, 28)>
<5, (8, 17, 11)>
<6, (8, 23, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 25)>
<8, (5, 6, 15)>
<9, (22, 26, 28)>
<10, (1, 19, 20)>
<14, (18, 22, 26)>
<15, (6, 8, 16)>
<16, (2, 15, 2)>
<17, (5, 11, 19)>
<18, (14, 22, 26)>
<19, (10, 17, 25)>
<20, (4, 10, 28)>
<21, (2, 12, 24)>
<22, (9, 14, 29)>
<23, (6, 7, 24)>
<24, (20, 21, 4)>
<25, (1, 7, 19)>
<26, (9, 14, 18)>
<27, (11, 22, 28)>
<28, (20, 26, 29)>
<29, (3, 28, 22)>
