For node 12:
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 11, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (4, 5, 11)>, <12, (4, 5, 9)>, <12, (4, 11, 9)>, <12, (5, 11, 9)>

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 2.
- Node 14 does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 0 = 68
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
