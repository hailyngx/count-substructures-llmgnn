Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 12) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 13) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 2) (25, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (18, 22) (18, 9) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 14) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 0) (26, 22) (26, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 19) (19, 21) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 27) (6, 22) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 20) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 0) (5, 28) (5, 11) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 9) (12, 20) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3 + 10 \cdot 7 = 2 + 12 + 70 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [84].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 7, 25)>
<7, (13, 16, 24)>
<22, (6, 16, 29)>
<29, (1, 14, 28)>
<0, (1, 12, 21)>
