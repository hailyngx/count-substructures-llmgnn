Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 22) (27, 26) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (10, 23) (10, 25) (10, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 28) (5, 20) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 23) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 25) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 20) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 4) (11, 5) (11, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 11) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 19) (25, 10) (25, 22) (25, 13) (19, 16) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 22) (29, 15) (29, 10) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 12) (20, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, and 26. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with 2 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 3-stars with 3 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 3-stars with 4 of its neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 31.

So, in total, there are [31] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0,(1, 14, 21)>, <2, (3, 16, 28)>, <2, (3, 18, 26)>, <2, (16, 18, 28)>, <2, (18, 26, 28)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 18)>, <3, (4, 9, 13)>, <4, (3, 6, 13)>, <7, (6, 15, 22)>, <8, (0, 12, 18)>, <10,(23, 25, 28)>, <11,(5, 13, 23)>, <14,(0, 18, 23)>, <15,(7, 15, 29)>, <16,(2, 16, 19)>, <18,(2, 14, 26)>, <18,(8, 18, 26)>, <18,(14, 18, 26)>, <20,(12, 13, 20)>, <23,(10, 11, 23)>, <26,(18, 21, 26)>, <26,(21, 24, 26)>.
