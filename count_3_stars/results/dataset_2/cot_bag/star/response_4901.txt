Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 21) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 9) (7, 28) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 1) (2, 18) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 11) (20, 18) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 28) (14, 0) (14, 3) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (17, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 23) (25, 4) (25, 1) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 22) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 23) (11, 0) (11, 29) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 5) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 21) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 28) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 13) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 14) (3, 8) (5, 24) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 4, 7, 18, 0, 20, 22, 1, 6, 21, 3, 24, 28.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 48 \)

So, there are 48 total 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us: [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (19, 23, 7)>
<26, (22, 21, 9)>
<18, (20, 6, 3)>
<0, (20, 10, 14)>
<20, (0, 18, 28)>
<22, (26, 16, 8)>
<1, (16, 25, 27)>
<6, (17, 1, 23)>
<21, (4, 13, 15)>
<3, (2, 8, 14)>
<24, (27, 29, 5)>
<28, (7, 13, 20)>
