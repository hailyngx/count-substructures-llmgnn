Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 10) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 15) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (2, 3) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 13) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 3) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 17) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 0) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24

Thus, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 16)>, <4, (6, 11, 16)>, <5, (0, 14, 19)>, <6, (1, 4, 10)>, <7, (11, 15, 17)>, <9, (6, 10, 19)>, <10, (6, 9, 12)>, <13, (3, 14, 18)>, <15, (7, 8, 17)>, <16, (4, 5, 3)>, <17, (0, 15, 18)>, <18, (2, 13, 17)>.
