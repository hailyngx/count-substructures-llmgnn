Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) 

Response:
In this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 9 \times 4 + 5 \times 10 = 36 + 50 = 86 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [86].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 12, 13)>
<1, (0, 3, 11)>
<2, (0, 4, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 11)>
<6, (3, 10, 14)>
<7, (9, 12, 13)>
<8, (3, 10, 11)>
<9, (7, 13, 12)>
<10, (5, 6, 8)>
<11, (1, 5, 8)>
<12, (7, 10, 1)>
<13, (0, 7, 2)>
<14, (2, 4, 10)>
