Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 26) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (12, 13) (12, 28) (12, 26) (27, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 22) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 23) (21, 2) (21, 6) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 20) (26, 10) (26, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 6) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 1) (23, 27) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 16) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 19) (1, 2) (1, 19) (20, 13) (20, 6) (0, 29) (0, 28) (0, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {29, 28, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 19}
- Node 2: {8, 18, 22, 1, 21}
- Node 3: {7, 11, 26, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 14, 29, 15}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {7, 21, 3, 0, 20}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 2, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 10: {11, 26}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {13, 28, 26}
- Node 13: {12, 26, 16, 20}
- Node 14: {4, 11, 22, 16}
- Node 15: {4, 25, 19}
- Node 16: {13, 25, 14}
- Node 17: {9, 11, 22}
- Node 18: {2, 8}
- Node 19: {28, 1, 15}
- Node 20: {13, 6}
- Node 21: {2, 6}
- Node 22: {2, 17, 14}
- Node 23: {27, 29}
- Node 25: {26, 16, 15}
- Node 26: {10, 12, 13, 25, 3}
- Node 27: {23}
- Node 28: {12, 19}
- Node 29: {4, 0, 23}

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets []:
\[ [10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [34] \]
