Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be represented as: 

Node 0: (0, 1, 2, 6) \
Node 1: (1, 0, 5, 7, 8) \
Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 6, 7, 9) \
Node 3: (3, 2, 5, 6, 8) \
Node 4: (4, 5, 6, 7) \
Node 5: (5, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8) \
Node 6: (6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 8) \
Node 7: (7, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8) \
Node 8: (8, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9) \
Node 9: (9, 2, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 1: 
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 3, 8)>
- <1, (5, 4, 7)>
- <1, (7, 4, 5)>

For Node 2: 
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>

For Node 3: 
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 4)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 1)>
- <3, (6, 4, 8)>
- <3, (6, 8, 5)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 4)>
- <5, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (5, 7, 4)>
- <5, (7, 1, 8)>
- <5, (7, 1, 4)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 1)>
- <6, (6, 4, 8)>
- <6, (6, 8, 5)>
- <6, (6, 0, 8)>
- <6, (6, 8, 3)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 4)>
- <7, (7, 5, 8)>
- <7, (7, 5, 4)>
- <7, (5, 1, 8)>
- <7, (5, 1, 4)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 3)>
- <8, (8, 5, 9)>
- <8, (8, 5, 3)>
- <8, (5, 1, 7)>
- <8, (5, 1, 3)>

For Node 9:
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (9, 8, 5)>
- <9, (9, 8, 3)>
- <9, (8, 5, 6)>
- <9, (8, 5, 3)>
- <9, (8, 5, 1)>

Counting up all the unique 3-stars we've found, we have a total of [48] 3-stars in this graph.
