Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: 
\[{4 \choose 3} = 4\]
- <1, (10, 4, 9)>
- <1, (8, 14, 9)>
- <1, (8, 14, 1)>
- <1, (4, 10, 9)>

For node 2: 
\[{6 \choose 3} = 20\]
- <2, (11, 13, 7)>
- <2, (13, 11, 4)>
- <2, (13, 11, 2)>
- <2, (13, 7, 2)>
- <2, (13, 7, 4)>
- <2, (11, 7, 2)>
- <2, (11, 7, 13)>
- <2, (11, 7, 4)>
- <2, (11, 13, 4)>
- <2, (7, 11, 4)>
- <2, (7, 11, 13)>
- <2, (7, 13, 2)>
- <2, (7, 13, 4)>
- <2, (7, 4, 2)>
- <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- <2, (4, 11, 2)>
- <2, (4, 13, 2)>
- <2, (4, 13, 7)>
- <2, (4, 13, 11)>
- <2, (4, 7, 2)>

For node 4: 
\[{5 \choose 3} = 10\]
- <4, (10, 11, 9)>
- <4, (10, 9, 13)>
- <4, (10, 9, 3)>
- <4, (11, 10, 13)>
- <4, (11, 10, 9)>
- <4, (11, 2, 13)>
- <4, (11, 2, 3)>
- <4, (9, 10, 13)>
- <4, (9, 10, 3)>
- <4, (9, 13, 3)>

For node 8: 
\[{3 \choose 3} = 1\]
- <8, (1, 14, 9)>

Adding up all the possibilities: 
\[4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 35\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].
