Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 72\)

So, there are 72 3-stars formed in this graph. 

Inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [72].

And the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 14, 10)>, <1, (0, 14, 8)>, <4, (12, 10, 14)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <10, (6, 12, 14)>, <11, (7, 13, 4)>, <12, (6, 4, 10)>, <14, (0, 1, 4)>.
