Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and we are given the edges in the graph. 

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

For node 1, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 possible 3-stars.
For node 2, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 possible 3-stars.
For node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
For node 7, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 possible 3-stars.

Adding all these up gives a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 60 possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 7)>,
<4, (1, 6, 9)>.
