Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 21) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 28) (26, 8) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 17) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 5) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 29) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 23) (2, 13) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 0) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 6) (17, 4) (17, 20) (17, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 14) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (23, 2) (23, 19) (6, 29) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 8) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 16) (27, 8) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 24) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 8) (14, 20) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are [39] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 12)>
<3, (0, 25, 28)>
<3, (7, 21, 29)>
<3, (21, 9, 20)>
<3, (25, 29, 6)>
<4, (18, 2, 0)>
<5, (0, 3, 12)>
<7, (21, 9, 20)>
<9, (21, 7, 3)>
<13, (2, 1, 24)>
<15, (19, 28, 5)>
<16, (9, 27, 8)>
<17, (4, 11, 20)>
<18, (4, 2, 0)>
<19, (15, 11, 23)>
<21, (9, 7, 20)>
<22, (6, 27, 8)>
<24, (12, 13, 14)>
<25, (3, 29, 6)>
<26, (28, 27, 16)>
<27, (26, 22, 8)>
<28, (20, 19, 9)>
<29, (7, 25, 6)>
