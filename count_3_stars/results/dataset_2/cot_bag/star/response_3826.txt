Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 22) (8, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 20) (17, 3) (7, 16) (7, 28) (12, 4) (12, 3) (6, 28) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 27) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 3) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 29) (9, 22) (22, 8) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 29) (13, 26) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 0) (20, 17) (20, 6) (20, 2) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 16) (29, 23) (29, 10) (29, 26) (29, 22) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 24) (27, 6) (27, 25) (27, 2) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 28) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 21) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 27) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 11) (0, 23) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 1) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 15) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 5) (24, 10) (24, 25) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 1
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to sum up the \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with a degree of 3 or more.

Calculating \( \sum \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with degree 4:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, 13, 26>
- <0, 13, 14>
- <0, 13, 15>
- <0, 1, 25>
- <3, 8, 22>
- <3, 17, 10>
- <3, 12, 4>
- <10, 17, 20>
- <10, 17, 21>
- <10, 24, 25>
- <13, 14, 21>
- <13, 15, 18>
- <16, 18, 26>
- <16, 21, 14>
- <16, 21, 10>
- <16, 21, 10>
- <16, 21, 14>
- <16, 21, 10>
- <16, 21, 14>
