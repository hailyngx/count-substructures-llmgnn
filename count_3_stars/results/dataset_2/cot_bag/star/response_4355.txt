Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:  
- Node 0 has neighbors {6, 14, 10}
- Node 2 has neighbors {9, 6, 4}
- Node 3 has neighbors {5, 6, 13}
- Node 11 has neighbors {6, 4, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 14, 10)>
- <2, (9, 6, 4)>
- <3, (5, 6, 13)>
- <11, (6, 4, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
