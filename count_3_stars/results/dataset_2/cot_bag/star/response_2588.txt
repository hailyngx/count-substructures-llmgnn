Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get: \[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [52] \]

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (4, 12, 2)>, <1, (7, 5, 12)>, <3, (1, 7, 5)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (4, 12, 2)>, <3, (7, 5, 12)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 12, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 12)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 8, 3)>, <5, (3, 7, 1)>, <5, (3, 8, 4)>, <6, (8, 5, 12)>, <6, (8, 5, 7)>, <6, (11, 7, 13)>, <6, (13, 11, 0)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 11, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 5)>, <7, (3, 8, 2)>, <10, (9, 12, 2)>, <10, (12, 2, 13)>, <11, (7, 6, 13)>, <11, (13, 6, 0)>, <12, (4, 2, 13)>, <12, (4, 2, 10)>
