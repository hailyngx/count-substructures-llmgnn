Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 13
- ...
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15 and 18

The graph is as described above. To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll look for nodes with three or more neighbors.

- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 16)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (3, 1, 17)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (12, 18, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (11, 14, 18)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (7, 9, 10)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find 7 3-stars in total, so the answer is [7].
