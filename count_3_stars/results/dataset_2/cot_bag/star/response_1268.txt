Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 3, and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9: They are not considered as they have less than 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets [] is 50.
