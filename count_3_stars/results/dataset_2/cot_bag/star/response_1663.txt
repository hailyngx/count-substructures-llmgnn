Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 13) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 16) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 13) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 19) (10, 8) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14, 7, 16, and 11 have 2 neighbors each, so they cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 1, 2, 5, 17, 4, 19, 9, 6, 10, 18, 8, and 13 have 3 neighbors each, so each can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 12 = 27 \).

Putting this number inside brackets, we get [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 15, 19)>, <3, (5, 9, 19)>, <3, (8, 13, 15)>, <3, (8, 15, 19)>, <0, (1, 7, 18)>, <0, (1, 5, 18)>, <0, (6, 18, 19)>, <0, (7, 16, 18)>, <1, (2, 5, 18)>, <1, (2, 7, 18)>, <1, (5, 7, 18)>, <2, (5, 17, 18)>, <4, (5, 13, 16)>, <5, (2, 4, 18)>, <5, (4, 13, 16)>, <16, (4, 7, 17)>, <16, (7, 8, 17)>, <16, (8, 10, 17)>, <13, (4, 15, 19)>.
