Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found within this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
