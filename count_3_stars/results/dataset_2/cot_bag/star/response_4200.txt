Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: {4, 5, 3, 6, 9}
Node 1: {3, 6, 2, 8}
Node 2: {1, 8, 6, 9}
Node 3: {4, 1, 8, 0}
Node 4: {7, 8, 5, 3, 0}
Node 5: {4, 7, 6, 0}
Node 6: {1, 5, 2, 0}
Node 7: {4, 9, 5}
Node 8: {4, 1, 3, 2}
Node 9: {7, 2, 0}

Now, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors: Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] = 45

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 3)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 3, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<1, (3, 0, 4)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 0, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 9, 0)>
