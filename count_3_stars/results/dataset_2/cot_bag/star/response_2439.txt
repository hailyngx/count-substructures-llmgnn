Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 64 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
<2, (6, 10, 13)>
<2, (11, 8, 14)>
<3, (10, 7, 13)>
<3, (10, 13, 4)>
<3, (7, 12, 5)>
<3, (7, 5, 0)>
<3, (12, 5, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (11, 8, 14)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>
<14, (11, 8, 0)>
<14, (11, 4, 2)>
<14, (4, 2, 3)>
<14, (4, 8, 3)>
