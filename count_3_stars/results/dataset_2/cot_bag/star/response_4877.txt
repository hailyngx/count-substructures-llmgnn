Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 4, 9, 13, 7, 6, 1, 0, 12, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 84 3-stars ([]). Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<5, 13, 6>
<5, 13, 0>
