Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 6, 9, 4, 7, and 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
5. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32 \). Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
