Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 16) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (9, 17, 16)>, <1, (12, 16, 15)>, <2, (7, 16, 0)>, <6, (7, 11, 8)>, <7, (2, 0, 16)>, <8, (6, 11, 18)>, <9, (5, 13, 0)>, <10, (17, 14, 10)>, <11, (6, 18, 3)>, <13, (9, 14, 18)>, <14, (13, 16, 10)>, <16, (0, 15, 1)>, <17, (0, 11, 10)>, <18, (13, 5, 11)>.
