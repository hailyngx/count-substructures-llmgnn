Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 15) (15, 22) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 26) (27, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 23) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 29) (19, 14) (26, 27) (26, 19) (26, 20) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 0) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 7) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 25) (16, 21) (16, 24) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 11) (24, 16) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 29) (7, 14) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 26) (0, 1) (0, 11) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 12) (6, 27) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 11) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 23) (23, 9) (23, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 0) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 28) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:

Node 13 has 4 neighbors
Node 22 has 3 neighbors
Node 15 has 2 neighbors
Node 27 has 2 neighbors
Node 8 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 19 has 4 neighbors
Node 26 has 3 neighbors
Node 1 has 3 neighbors
Node 17 has 3 neighbors
Node 2 has 3 neighbors
Node 18 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors
Node 12 has 3 neighbors
Node 21 has 4 neighbors
Node 29 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 20 has 3 neighbors
Node 25 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 28 has 3 neighbors
Node 23 has 2 neighbors
Node 11 has 4 neighbors
Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 29 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 25 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (13, 22, 21)>
<13, (22, 8, 11)>
<19, (3, 26, 29)>
<21, (16, 17, 29)>
<25, (1, 4, 12)>
<29, (1, 7, 11)>
<6, (3, 4, 11)>
<7, (5, 17, 14)>
