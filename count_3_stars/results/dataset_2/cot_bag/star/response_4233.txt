Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 9) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 2) (25, 20) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 23) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 29) (6, 11) (6, 23) (17, 7) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (28, 24) (28, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 13) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 24) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 1) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 15) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 9) (0, 15) (0, 1) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 26) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 12) (1, 22) (1, 16) (1, 0) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 13) (13, 28) (13, 27) (13, 23) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with at least 3 neighbors in this graph. Let's list them and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (7, 19, 23, 3)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 21, 9, 17)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (20, 18, 22, 23)
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (7, 29, 8)
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: (18, 17, 16)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (4, 11, 26, 12)
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (6, 3, 14)
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: (20, 14, 13)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (7, 21, 10, 14, 24)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (11, 27, 9, 12)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (17, 10, 26, 8)
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (4, 18, 22, 15)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (29, 24, 1, 16)
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (28, 10, 16, 9)
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (15, 1)
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (3, 8, 12)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (22, 16, 0)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: (4, 2, 6, 13)
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (28, 27, 23)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 51 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].
