Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 4) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 16) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 16) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes and then sum it up to find the total number of 3-stars.

Let's begin by identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
- <1, 9, 14, 17>
- <8, 9, 13, 17>
- <9, 1, 14, 15>
- <12, 0, 7, 19>
- <14, 1, 8, 17>
- <15, 4, 9, 16>
- <16, 2, 8 ,17>
- <17, 10, 13, 16>
- <17, 14, 8, 1>
- <19, 1, 4, 7>
