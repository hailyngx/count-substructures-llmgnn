Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 4) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 26) (26, 28) (26, 23) (27, 17) (27, 4) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 29) (16, 6) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 18) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 20) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 25) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (20, 3) (20, 10) (20, 1) (18, 3) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 23) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 7) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 12) (12, 0) (12, 11) (25, 4) (25, 29) 

Response:
There are three nodes with only one neighbor each: node 0, node 5, and node 30.

All other nodes have at least two neighbors. Here is the calculation of 3-stars for each of them based on their degree:

1. Node 1 has degree 3: [1]
2. Node 2 has degree 2: [0]
3. Node 3 has degree 4: [1, 1]
4. Node 4 has degree 4: [1, 1]
5. Node 6 has degree 3: [1]
6. Node 7 has degree 3: [1]
7. Node 8 has degree 3: [1]
8. Node 9 has degree 3: [1]
9. Node 10 has degree 4: [1, 1]
10. Node 11 has degree 3: [1]
11. Node 12 has degree 2: [0]
12. Node 13 has degree 5: [1, 1, 1]
13. Node 14 has degree 3: [1]
14. Node 15 has degree 2: [0]
15. Node 16 has degree 2: [0]
16. Node 17 has degree 3: [1]
17. Node 18 has degree 4: [1, 1]
18. Node 19 has degree 3: [1]
19. Node 20 has degree 3: [1]
20. Node 21 has degree 3: [1]
21. Node 22 has degree 3: [1]
22. Node 23 has degree 3: [1]
23. Node 24 has degree 2: [0]
24. Node 25 has degree 2: [0]
25. Node 26 has degree 2: [0]
26. Node 27 has degree 3: [1]
27. Node 28 has degree 4: [1, 1]
28. Node 29 has degree 3: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0] = [18]

Therefore, there are [18] unique 3-stars in the graph, listed below:
<1, (13, 19, 1)>
<3, (22, 13, 3)>
<3, (15, 4, 3)>
<3, (8, 4, 3)>
<7, (9, 13, 7)>
<10, (0, 10, 2)>
<13, (22, 11, 13)>
<13, (22, 5, 13)>
<13, (13, 19, 9)>
<13, (13, 11, 12)>
<18, (19, 8, 5)>
<18, (7, 18, 3)>
<18, (7, 9, 14)>
<18, (7, 18, 27)>
<18, (27, 4, 18)>
<21, (21, 17, 28)>
<21, (21, 28, 23)>
<21, (28, 8, 19)>
<28, (8, 28, 21)>
