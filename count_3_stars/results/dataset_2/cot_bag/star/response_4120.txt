Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are from 0 to 19.

Let's first check which nodes have three or more edges connected to them:
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 3 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 3 edges
- Node 10 has 3 edges
- Node 11 has 4 edges
- Node 13 has 2 edges
- Node 14 has 3 edges
- Node 15 has 3 edges
- Node 16 has 3 edges
- Node 17 has 4 edges
- Node 18 has 4 edges
- Node 19 has 4 edges

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 3, 7, 11, 17, and 18, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 2, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 19, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 6 \times 4 + 7 \times 1 = 24 + 7 = 31 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [31]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 7, 13)>
<3, (6, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 8, 19)>
<11, (0, 3, 19)>
<17, (2, 9, 18)>
