Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 9, 14)>
<2, (0, 7, 10)>
<4, (1, 6, 14)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<10, (0, 2, 7)>
<11, (0, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 7, 11)>
<14, (1, 6, 9)>
