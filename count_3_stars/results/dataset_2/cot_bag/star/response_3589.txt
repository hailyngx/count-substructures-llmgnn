Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 5) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 15) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 15) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 17) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(3, 10), (3, 9), (3, 19), (11, 7), (11, 1), (11, 12), (11, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 19), 
(0, 13), (7, 11), (7, 15), (7, 8), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 6), (4, 17), (12, 11), (12, 13),
(1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 16), (1, 5), (2, 11), (2, 9), (2, 14), (15, 7), (15, 14), (15, 5), 
(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 10), (13, 0), (13, 4), (13, 12), (13, 16), (13, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), 
(5, 15), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 9), (14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 15), (16, 1), (16, 13), 
(17, 4), (17, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 17), (19, 3), (19, 0), (19, 6), (6, 4), (6, 13), 
(6, 19)
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 8, 19, 13 ⇒ 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has neighbors: 11, 14, 16, 5 ⇒ 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has neighbors: 11, 9, 14 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has neighbors: 10, 9, 19 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has neighbors: 13, 10, 6, 17 ⇒ 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 15 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 13, 19 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has neighbors: 11, 15, 8 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 7, 17 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 2, 10 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has neighbors: 3, 4, 9 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 1, 12, 2 ⇒ 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has neighbors: 0, 4, 12, 16, 6 ⇒ 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has neighbors: 7, 15, 5 ⇒ 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has neighbors: 3, 0, 6 ⇒ 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 0
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 1
- 1 3-star for Node 2
- 1 3-star for Node 3
- 1 3-star for Node 4
- 1 3-star for Node 5
- 1 3-star for Node 6
- 1 3-star for Node 7
- 1 3-star for Node 8
- 1 3-star for Node 9
- 1 3-star for Node 10
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 11
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 13
- 1 3-star for Node 15
- 1 3-star for Node 19

Summing up the 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [31] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 31. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 8, 19)>
- <0, (5, 13, 19)>
- <0, (8, 13, 19)>
- <1, (14, 16, 5)>
- <2, (9, 11, 14)>
- <3, (9, 10, 19)>
- <4, (6, 13, 19)>
- <7, (8, 11, 15)>
- <13, (12, 16, 6)>
- <11, (12, 1, 2)>
- <0, (19, 6, 3)>
- <10, (3, 4, 9)>
- <15, (5, 7, 15)>
- <11, (7, 1, 2)>
- <0, (13, 5, 19)>
- <13, (6, 16, 12)>
- <13, (4, 6, 19)>
- <13, (0, 12, 4)>
- <20, (19, 0, 3)>
