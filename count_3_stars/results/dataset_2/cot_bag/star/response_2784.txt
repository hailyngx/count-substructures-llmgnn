Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 11) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 1: With 6 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 3: With 5 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 3 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 5: With 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 6: With 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 7: With 6 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 7 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 9: With 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 12: With 6 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 12 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 13: With 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with node 13 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get: 
\[ 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 90 \]

So, the final number of 3-stars is \( [90] \).
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 10)>
- <1, (0, 7, 12)>
- <3, (6, 10, 12)>
- <5, (0, 8, 13)>
- <6, (3, 7, 12)>
- <7, (1, 4, 12)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <12, (1, 3, 7)>
- <13, (1, 3, 5)>
