Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 1, 3, 4, 9, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: Node 1 has neighbors 4, 10, 8, 14, 12, and 13. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 6, so there are 20 3-stars centered at node 1.

2. Node 3: Node 3 has neighbors 5, 7, 10, 0, 14, and 2. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 6, so there are 20 3-stars centered at node 3.

3. Node 4: Node 4 has neighbors 5, 7, 8, 1. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4, so there are 4 3-stars centered at node 4.

4. Node 9: Node 9 has neighbors 5, 2, 11, 10, 13, 12. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 6, so there are 20 3-stars centered at node 9.

5. Node 12: Node 12 has neighbors 9, 0, 2, 13, 1. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5, so there are 10 3-stars centered at node 12.

6. Node 14: Node 14 has neighbors 8, 0, 3, 1, 13. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5, so there are 10 3-stars centered at node 14.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of \(20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 84\) 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [84].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
