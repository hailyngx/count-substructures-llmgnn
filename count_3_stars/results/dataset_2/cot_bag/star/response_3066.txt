Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 13) (4, 9) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 8) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 1) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 2) (2, 19) (2, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all the 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 14, 16)>, <3, (0, 12, 13)>, <7, (11, 14, 16)>, <8, (12, 18, 19)>, <9, (0, 11, 17)>, 
<10, (1, 12, 15)>, <11, (7, 9, 13)>, <12, (3, 10, 8)>, <13, (3, 11, 18)>, <14, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<15, (3, 10, 17)>, <17, (7, 11, 15)>, <19, (1, 2, 8)>
