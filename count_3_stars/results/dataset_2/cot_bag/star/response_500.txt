Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 28) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (28, 5) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 27) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 0) (22, 7) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 21) (10, 2) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 7) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (0, 26) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 23) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 11) (8, 29) (8, 3) (8, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 14) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (12, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 22) (7, 13) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors they have are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 1 neighbor
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \sum_{v \text{ with } \geq 3\text{ neighbors}} \binom{v}{3} = \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 109\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [109].
