Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 14, 10, 15, 6, 19, 2, 9, 0, 18, 5, and 11.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: only 1 3-star
4. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: only 1 3-star
6. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: only 1 3-star
9. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: only 1 3-star
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: only 1 3-star
11. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48

So, inside brackets, we have [48].
