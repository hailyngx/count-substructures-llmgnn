Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (15, 21) (15, 12) (21, 15) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 17) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 9) (25, 20) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 29) (3, 18) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 5) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 29) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 29) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 2) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 17) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 23) (29, 4) (22, 20) (22, 27) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 22) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 20) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 29) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 15, 21, 8, 13, 10, 20, 25, 1, 12, 16, 28, 5, 19, 6, 24, 23, 29, 27, 17, and 4.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 21 has 2 neighbors.
5. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
8. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
9. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
10. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
11. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
12. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
13. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
14. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
15. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
16. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
17. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
18. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
19. Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
20. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
21. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
22. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 33 3-stars in this graph.
So, the final answer is [33]. 
And the unique 3-stars found are:
<9, 25, 20>, <26, 1, 20>, <26, 1, 7>, <26, 23, 28>, <8, 10, 11>, <13, 10, 11>, <13, 10, 19>, <13, 24, 29>, <10, 19, 0>, <20, 7, 1>, <20, 7, 17>, <1, 20, 7>, <1, 20, 5>, <1, 20, 7>, <12, 3, 0>, <5, 4, 20>, <5, 4, 29>, <19, 6, 4>, <19, 0, 3>, <6, 4, 20>, <6, 4, 29>, <24, 8, 13>, <24, 8, 29>, <24, 13, 28>, <8, 13, 28>, <23, 26, 28>, <23, 28, 29>, <0, 3, 19>, <7, 17, 21>, <7, 17, 11>, <29, 23, 28>, <4, 6, 19>, <4, 6, 29>.
