Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 3, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 7, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 7}

By counting the number of neighbors for each node, we see that nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 38 3-stars, which we will put inside brackets.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
