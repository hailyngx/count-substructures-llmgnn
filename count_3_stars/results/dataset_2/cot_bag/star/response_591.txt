Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
