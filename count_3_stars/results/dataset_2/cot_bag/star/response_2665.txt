Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (18, 8) (18, 7) (12, 15) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 11) (7, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0, 13, 14: 
  There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each of them. 
  So, there are 3 3-stars in total: <0, (1, 5, 16)>, <13, (1, 9, 14)>, <14, (0, 3, 13)>.

- For nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17: 
  There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them. 
  So, there are 40 3-stars in total.

Adding the 3-stars for nodes with 3 neighbors:
- For nodes 3: 
  There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
- For node 12:
  There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
- For nodes 4, 7, 9, 18, 19: 
  There are \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \).

In total, there are [43] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
