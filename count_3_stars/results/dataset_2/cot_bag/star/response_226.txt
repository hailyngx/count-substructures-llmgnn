Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
To begin, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 6
- Node 7: degree = 5
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 35. Therefore, the final answer is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:
