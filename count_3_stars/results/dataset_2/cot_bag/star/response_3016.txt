Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it forms. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes forms:
- Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 4: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 8: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 9: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 10: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 11: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 13: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 15: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 16: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 18: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 19: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Hence, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (16, 10, 13)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (12, 13, 15)>, <8, (5, 8, 11)>, <9, (13, 18, 0)>, <10, (2, 13, 19)>, 
<11, (15, 12, 8)>, <13, (17, 12, 10)>, <15, (0, 11, 6)>, <16, (2, 4, 19)>, <18, (6, 5, 9)>, <19, (10, 14, 16)>
