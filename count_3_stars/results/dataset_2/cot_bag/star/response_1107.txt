Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 4, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 4, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are also \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

Summing up, there are a total of 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 3-stars in this graph.
The final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<5, (1, 0, 2)>
<5, (1, 0, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (1, 7, 6)>

<8, (4, 6, 1)>
