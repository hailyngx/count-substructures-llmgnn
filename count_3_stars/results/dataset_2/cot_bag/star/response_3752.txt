Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 1) (8, 2) (15, 10) (15, 19) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 4) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 17) (7, 3) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 9) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 9, 10, 14, and 16.

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 3, 9, 8, 16
- Number of 3-stars: $C(4,3) = 4$

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 7, 19
- Number of 3-stars: $C(3,3) = 1$

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 1, 0, 18, 4
- Number of 3-stars: $C(4,3) = 4$

For node 10:
- Neighbors: 15, 13, 16
- Number of 3-stars: $C(3,3) = 1$

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 2
- Number of 3-stars: $C(3,3) = 1$

For node 16:
- Neighbors: 1, 10, 17, 13
- Number of 3-stars: $C(4,3) = 4$

Total number of 3-stars: $4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15$

So, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 8, 9>
- <1, 8, 16>
- <1, 9, 16>
- <3, 1, 7>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <10, 13, 16>
- <14, 0, 4>
