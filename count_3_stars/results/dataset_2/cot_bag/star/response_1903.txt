Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 0, 16, 19, 15, 12, 13, 14, 10, 11, 5, 7, and 1.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 6: 
   - Total neighbors: 5
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with 6 as center: 
     <6, (9, 15, 16)>, <6, (9, 15, 11)>, <6, (9, 16, 11)>, <6, (15, 16, 11)>, <6, (9, 16, 19)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (16, 15, 19)>, <6, (9, 11, 19)>, <6, (11, 16, 19)>

2. Node 9: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-stars with 9 as center: 
     <9, (6, 4, 10)>

3. Node 8: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-stars with 8 as center: 
     <8, (3, 2, 11)>

4. Node 0: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-stars with 0 as center: 
     <0, (2, 5, 16)>

5. Node 16: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

6. Node 19: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

7. Node 15: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with 15 as center: 
     <15, (6, 0, 7)>, <15, (7, 11, 0)>, <15, (6, 7, 11)>, <15, (7, 11, 6)>

8. Node 12: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-stars with 12 as center: 
     <12, (8, 13, 14)>

9. Node 13: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

10. Node 14: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

11. Node 10: 
   - Total neighbors: 2
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

12. Node 11: 
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - Number of 3-stars: 1
   - Unique 3-stars with 11 as center: 
     <11, (8, 5, 15)>

13. Node 5: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

14. Node 7: 
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

15. Node 1: 
   - Total neighbors: 2
   - Number of 3-stars: 0

Adding all the 3-stars together gives us a total of 18 3-stars in this graph [18].
