Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's find the total number of 3-stars and list them:

1. For node 6: 
   - <6, (9, 11, 8)>
   - <6, (9, 13, 8)>
   - So, 2 3-stars are formed with node 6.

2. For node 9: 
   - <9, (6, 8, 13)>
   - So, 1 3-star is formed with node 9.

3. For node 8: 
   - <8, (6, 9, 13)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 14)>
   - So, 2 3-stars are formed with node 8.

4. For node 13: 
   - <13, (6, 8, 12)>
   - So, 1 3-star is formed with node 13.

5. For node 4: 
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

6. For node 7: 
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

7. For node 12: 
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

8. For node 0: 
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

9. For node 14: 
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

10. For node 2: 
    - <2, (7, 12, 3)>
    - So, 1 3-star is formed with node 2.

11. For node 11: 
    - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

12. For node 1: 
    - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

13. For node 5: 
    - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

14. For node 3: 
    - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

15. For node 10: 
    - No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7

So, there are 7 3-stars in total in this graph. Putting this in brackets: [7].
