Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 5, 9, 4, 13, 0
2: 7, 3, 12, 14
3: 4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 2
4: 8, 0, 1, 3
5: 12, 1, 7
6: 11, 13
7: 5, 11, 3, 14, 2
8: 4, 10, 13, 3
9: 11, 14, 1, 0
10: 0, 3, 8, 14
11: 9, 7, 3, 6
12: 5, 2
13: 8, 1, 0, 6
14: 9, 7, 10, 2

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 3: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 10: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 14: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 9, 13)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<7, (5, 11, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 13)>
<9, (11, 1, 0)>
<14, (9, 10, 2)>
