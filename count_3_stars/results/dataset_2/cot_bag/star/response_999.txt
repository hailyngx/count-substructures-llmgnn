Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<1, (11, 17, 12)>
<1, (11, 17, 1)>
<1, (11, 12, 1)>
<1, (17, 12, 1)>

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<2, (17, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<3, (13, 16, 10)>
<3, (13, 16, 7)>
<3, (13, 16, 4)>
<3, (13, 10, 7)>

- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<7, (13, 16, 10)>
<7, (13, 6, 4)>
<7, (13, 6, 19)>
<7, (16, 3, 13)>
<7, (16, 3, 10)>
<7, (16, 13, 10)>
<7, (3, 10, 13)>
<7, (3, 10, 16)>
<7, (3, 13, 16)>
<7, (10, 13, 16)>

- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<9, (0, 12, 19)>

- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<11, (16, 17, 1)>
<11, (16, 17, 8)>
<11, (16, 1, 8)>
<11, (17, 1, 8)>

- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<12, (7, 1, 9)>

- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<13, (16, 17, 3)>
<13, (16, 17, 4)>
<13, (16, 3, 4)>
<13, (17, 3, 4)>

- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<19, (6, 18, 9)>
<19, (6, 18, 19)>
<19, (6, 9, 19)>
<19, (18, 9, 19)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above, we get a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
