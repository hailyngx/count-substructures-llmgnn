Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 14) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 19) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 6) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 3) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 19) (20, 3) (20, 19) (20, 28) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 28) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 17) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 14) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 9) (25, 2) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 9) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (17, 26) (17, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) (3, 8) (3, 20) (3, 9) (14, 21) (14, 27) (14, 13) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 12) (12, 11) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 21, 28, and 0)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (edges with nodes 29, 11, and 25)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (edges with nodes 27, 5, and 16)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 22, 23, 28, and 6)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (edges with nodes 10, 25, 7, 3, and 13)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 20, 16, 18, and 9)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 2, 8, 18, and 12)
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (edges with nodes 28, 9, and 14)
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors (edges with nodes 21, 8, and 19)
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 3, 19, 28, and 10)
- Node 21 has 15 neighbors (edges with nodes 1, 27, 15, 14, 21, 5, 20, 18, 19, 7, 0, 17, 0, 16, and 13)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 22, 6, 25, and 23)
- Node 25 has 6 neighbors (edges with nodes 2, 23, 27, 9, 25, and 3)
- Node 27 has 6 neighbors (edges with nodes 21, 4, 25, 14, 27, and 19)
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors (edges with nodes 1, 20, 6, 13, and 28)
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors (edges with nodes 2, 7, 19, and 29)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{15}{3} = 455 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 455 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 537 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [537].
