Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) (9, 13) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes and 60 edges in this graph. Let's analyze the nodes to see which ones form 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (7, 13, 1, 6)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (4, 3, 10, 13, 5)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (13, 10, 6, 12)
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 12, 1, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (7, 2, 3)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 12, 0)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (7, 5, 11, 14)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (3, 14, 0, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 12, 14, 0)
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors (8, 13, 6, 2, 10, 14)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (3, 11, 2, 12)
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (6, 11, 2, 10)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (7, 8, 12, 0)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (4, 13)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (13, 11)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up, we have a total of [58] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 1, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 10)>, <8, (13, 6, 12)>, <13, (4, 8, 12)>, <12, (8, 13, 6)>.
