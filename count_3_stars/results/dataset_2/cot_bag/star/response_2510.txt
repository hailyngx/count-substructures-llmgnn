Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 13) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 1) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 15) (4, 19) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 43 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 10)>
<1, (7, 9, 14)>
<1, (7, 9, 17)>
<1, (7, 14, 17)>
<2, (7, 8, 19)>
<2, (12, 17, 19)>
<2, (8, 12, 19)>
<2, (8, 17, 19)>
<7, (12, 14, 17)>
<9, (1, 7, 14)>
<9, (1, 7, 17)>
<13, (3, 16, 18)>
<18, (10, 13, 19)>
<18, (13, 16, 19)>
<18, (13, 18, 19)>
<18, (13, 3, 19)>
<19, (2, 4, 18)>
<19, (4, 15, 18)>
<19, (4, 18, 15)>
<19, (4, 18, 18)>
