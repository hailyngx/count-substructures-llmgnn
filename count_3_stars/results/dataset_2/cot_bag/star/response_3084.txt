Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 18) (0, 18) (0, 26) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (1, 5) (1, 22) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 12) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 5) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 19) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 29) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 25) (23, 24) (23, 13) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 29) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 21) (7, 13) (19, 28) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 20) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 23) (18, 20) (20, 2) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 18) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 9) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 9) (25, 23) (9, 17) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 24) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (24, 2) (24, 23) (24, 13) (24, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 28. These nodes are the potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].
