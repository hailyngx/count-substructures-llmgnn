Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 11) (7, 24) (7, 6) (7, 9) (24, 7) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 23) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 9) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (17, 15) (17, 20) (29, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (8, 2) (8, 19) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 25) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 14) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 25) (22, 24) (22, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 27) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 16) (26, 3) (26, 18) (23, 24) (23, 2) (23, 5) (16, 1) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 5) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 with neighbors 21, 6, and 16
- Node 2 with neighbors 4, 8, and 23
- Node 5 with neighbors 13, 19, and 23
- Node 6 with neighbors 1, 7, and 27
- Node 9 with neighbors 7, 12, and 16
- Node 11 with neighbors 21, 24, and 28
- Node 12 with neighbors 14, 0, and 9
- Node 13 with neighbors 29, 28, and 5
- Node 14 with neighbors 12, 4, and 18
- Node 15 with neighbors 3, 19, and 17
- Node 16 with neighbors 1, 20, and 10
- Node 19 with neighbors 15, 8, and 5
- Node 24 with neighbors 7, 11, and 27
- Node 25 with neighbors 28, 5, and 0
- Node 27 with neighbors 24, 10, and 6
- Node 28 with neighbors 11, 13, and 25

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 24, 27, and 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For nodes 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 13 \times 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 \). 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 15.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (21, 6, 16)>, <2, (4, 8, 23)>, <5, (13, 19, 23)>, <6, (1, 7, 27)>
<9, (7, 12, 16)>, <11, (21, 24, 28)>, <12, (14, 0, 9)>, <13, (29, 28, 5)>
<14, (12, 4, 18)>, <15, (3, 19, 17)>, <16, (1, 20, 10)>, <19, (15, 8, 5)>
<24, (7, 11, 27)>, <27, (24, 10, 6)>, <28, (11, 13, 25)>
