Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 55 \)

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in the given graph. Represented in the requested format, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 3)>, <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 5)>, <7, (2, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>.

So, the final answer is [55].
