Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 12) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 11) (10, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 0) (12, 15) (12, 13) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 11, 16, 3, 15, 9, 1, 10, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 4, 0, 7, 12, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 11, 16, 3, 15, 13, 14, and 17, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them.
- For nodes 9, 1, 10, 8, 18, 4, and 12, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each of them.
- For nodes 0, 7, and 19, they all have exactly 2 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( (7 \times 4) + (7 \times 1) = 28 + 7 = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 35.
