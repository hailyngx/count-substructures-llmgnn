Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (17, 8) (17, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 8) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 16) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 13) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18.  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 11: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 12: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 13: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 14: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 16: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 18: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 \).  
Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>  
<1, (0, 4, 8)>  
<4, (1, 0, 18)>  
<7, (10, 3, 14)>  
<8, (1, 4, 12)>  
<10, (7, 14, 0)>  
<11, (10, 1, 3)>  
<12, (4, 8, 16)>  
<13, (16, 14, 7)>  
<14, (10, 7, 13)>  
<16, (12, 13, 2)>  
<18, (6, 9, 4)>
