Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: 6, 2, 4, 7
2: 1, 8, 6, 9, 0
3: 9, 4, 6
4: 1, 3, 0, 7, 9
5: 0, 6
6: 1, 5, 2, 3, 9
7: 0, 1, 4, 9
8: 0, 2, 9
9: 2, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 59

So, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
