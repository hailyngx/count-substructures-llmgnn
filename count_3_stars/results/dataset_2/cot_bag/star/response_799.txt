Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 10, 11, 6, 14, 2, 8, 4, 12, 1, 3, 7, and 13. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) - Less than 3 neighbors
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up, 
Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 65 \)

So, there are 65 3-stars in this graph.
Putting it inside brackets: [65]

The unique 3-stars found are:
