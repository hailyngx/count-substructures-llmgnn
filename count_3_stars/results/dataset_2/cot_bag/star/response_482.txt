Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can create the following visualization to better understand the structure:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (9, 0), (2, 0), (7, 0), (1, 0)
- 1: (9, 1), (6, 1), (2, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (0, 1)
- 2: (8, 2), (4, 2), (1, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2)
- 3: (5, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3)
- 4: (6, 4), (2, 4)
- 5: (9, 5), (8, 5), (3, 5)
- 6: (1, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)
- 7: (9, 7), (2, 7), (0, 7), (1, 7)
- 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (1, 8)
- 9: (5, 9), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- For node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- For node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- For node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [52] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 0, 7)>
