Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 15) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 16) (15, 12) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 8, 12, 0, 14, 6, 16, 12, 3, 11, 1, 15, 9, 19, 10.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \)

So, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (7, 10, 8)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <8, (4, 12, 1)>, <12, (8, 0, 15)>, <0, (14, 16, 1)>, <14, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (14, 16, 5)>, <16, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (2, 10, 9)>, <11, (0, 7, 19)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <15, (12, 13, 0)>, <9, (8, 14, 3)>, <19, (7, 18, 9)>.
