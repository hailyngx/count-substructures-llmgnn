Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- For node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 10, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars.
- For node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 63 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [63].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 12)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 13)>
<10, (1, 8, 13)>
<12, (0, 4, 5)>
<13, (1, 2, 6)>
