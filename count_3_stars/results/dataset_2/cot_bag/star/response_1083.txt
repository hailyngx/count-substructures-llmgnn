Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 1)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 1)

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. These nodes are: 4, 5, and 8.

For node 4:
- 3-star with node 4 as center: <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <4, (8, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 9, 5)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 5:
- 3-star with node 5 as center: <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (7, 0, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 2)>

For node 8:
- 3-star with node 8 as center: <8, (4, 9, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (9, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>

Counting these, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
