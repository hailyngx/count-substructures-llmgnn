Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 8, 9, 15, 16, 20, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 19, 23. The number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 14, 20, 28. The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 15, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 12. The number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 16, there are 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7. The number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 20, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 9, 26, 27. The number of 3-stars with node 20 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 22, there are 3 neighbors: 5, 21, 29. The number of 3-stars with node 22 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 25, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 10, 29, 25. The number of 3-stars with node 25 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 26, there are 4 neighbors: 12, 20, 27, 6. The number of 3-stars with node 26 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 27, there are 3 neighbors: 18, 20, 26. The number of 3-stars with node 27 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 29, there are 3 neighbors: 22, 25, 28. The number of 3-stars with node 29 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we have a total of \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31\). 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are: <8, (11, 13, 19)>, <9, (7, 14, 28)>, <15, (0, 7, 12)>, <16, (2, 4, 7)>, <20, (3, 9, 26)>, <22, (5, 21, 29)>, <25, (0, 1, 10)>, <26, (12, 20, 27)>, <27, (18, 20, 26)>, <29, (22, 25, 28)>.
