Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 4)>
<5, (3, 0, 9)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
