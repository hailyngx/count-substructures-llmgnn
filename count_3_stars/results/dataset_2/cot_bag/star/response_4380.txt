Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {9, 6, 8}
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 3, 7}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 8, 7}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {8, 1, 3}
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: {9, 1, 7, 3, 0, 2}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 3, 2}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {9, 4, 0, 3}
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 7, 0, 9}

By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we find:
\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 80 \]

Hence, there are 80 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [80].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (8, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 0, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
