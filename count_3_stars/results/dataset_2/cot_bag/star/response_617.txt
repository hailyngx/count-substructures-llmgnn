Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 2) (22, 11) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 13) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 14) (29, 11) (29, 24) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 13) (26, 28) (26, 19) (1, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (3, 2) (21, 9) (21, 24) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (9, 17) (9, 21) (18, 24) (18, 0) (7, 28) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 5) (5, 20) (5, 25) (5, 12) (5, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 3) (13, 27) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 15, 27, 25, 19, 26, 17, 21, 12, 9, 24, 14, 20, 5, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in this graph.  

Inside brackets: [45]
Unique 3-stars: <11, (16, 22, 29)>, <16, (11, 12, 15)>, <15, (16, 27, 19)>, <27, (15, 10, 13)>, <25, (20, 5, 19)>, <19, (15, 25, 26)>, <12, (16, 5, 0)>, <24, (20, 29, 21)>, <14, (15, 28, 4)>, <20, (25, 24, 2)>, <5, (20, 25, 12)>, <10, (27, 1, 8)>
