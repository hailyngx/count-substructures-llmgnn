Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 0, 4, and 5. 

For node 0:
- The neighbors of node 0 are: 4, 1, 3, 8, 2.
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- There are 10 total 3-stars with node 0 as the center node.

For node 4:
- The neighbors of node 4 are: 7, 8, 0, 6, 3.
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- There are 10 total 3-stars with node 4 as the center node.

For node 5:
- The neighbors of node 5 are: 9, 2, 1, 0.
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- There are 4 total 3-stars with node 5 as the center node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 4] = [24] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<0, (4, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
