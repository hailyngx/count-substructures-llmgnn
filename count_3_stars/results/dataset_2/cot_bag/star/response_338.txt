Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have at least three neighbors: node 5, node 9, node 8, node 1, and node 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
