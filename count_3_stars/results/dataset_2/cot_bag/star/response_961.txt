Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
We first find the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 7
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 10: Degree 4
- Node 11: Degree 5
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 5
- Node 14: Degree 3

We can see that nodes 5 and 2 have 7 and 6 neighbors respectively, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in.

For Node 5, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

For Node 2, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 35 + 20 = 55 \), so we have a total of [55] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
