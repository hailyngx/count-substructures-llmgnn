Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 18) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 11) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 1) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (7, 9) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 17) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 18) (2, 15) (2, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: 14, 16, 4, 12
- Node 1: 5, 14, 10, 7, 18
- Node 2: 15, 16
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 6, 0, 14
- Node 5: 9, 12, 1
- Node 6: 18, 4
- Node 7: 9, 1
- Node 8: 9, 3, 11, 15
- Node 9: 5, 8, 7
- Node 10: 15, 1
- Node 11: 19, 13, 8, 17
- Node 12: 5, 0, 17
- Node 13: 11, 19, 18
- Node 14: 0, 1, 4
- Node 15: 8, 10, 2, 16
- Node 16: 0, 15, 2, 19
- Node 17: 11, 12
- Node 18: 6, 13, 1
- Node 19: 11, 13, 16

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26. Therefore, the final answer is [26].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 12, 7)>
<8, (9, 11, 15)>
<11, (19, 13, 18)>
<15, (10, 2, 16)>
