Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 27) (18, 23) (18, 10) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 1) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 25) (8, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 18) (10, 17) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (20, 11) (28, 10) (28, 11) (28, 24) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 26) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 25) (11, 8) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 4) (21, 3) (21, 2) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 12) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 16) (16, 22) (16, 7) (1, 6) (1, 22) (1, 24) (2, 13) (2, 21) (12, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 9) (27, 19) (27, 25) (27, 24) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 29) (24, 28) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 27) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 6, 9, 18, 22, 8, 10, 17, 20, 28, 5, 14, 11, 21, 29, 26, 7, 1, 2, 19, 25, 27, 23, and 24.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
2. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
4. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
6. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
16. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
18. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
20. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
21. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
22. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
23. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
24. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
25. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[ [10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [61] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <15, (4, 5, 19)>
2. <15, (4, 5, 20)>
3. <15, (4, 19, 20)>
4. <15, (5, 19, 20)>
5. <6, (1, 9, 22)>
6. <9, (1, 6, 27)>
7. <9, (1, 27, 29)>
8. <9, (6, 27, 29)>
9. <9, (27, 28, 29)>
10. <22, (1, 5, 16)>
11. <8, (7, 25, 26)>
12. <8, (14, 25, 26)>
13. <8, (14, 25, 29)>
14. <8, (14, 26, 29)>
15. <8, (25, 26, 29)>
16. <10, (17, 18, 28)>
17. <17, (0, 10, 23)>
18. <20, (11, 15, 19)>
19. <17, (0, 23, 29)>
20. <28, (10, 11, 24)>
21. <5, (15, 22, 26)>
22. <14, (7, 8, 26)>
23. <29, (8, 23, 27)>
24. <26, (5, 14, 7)>
