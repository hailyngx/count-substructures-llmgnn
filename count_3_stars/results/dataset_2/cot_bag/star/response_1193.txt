Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 5: In order for 3-stars to be formed, node 5 must have at least 3 neighbors. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>

For node 9: Node 9 also has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9:
<9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 3, 4)>, <9, (5, 0, 4)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 4)>, <9, (8, 0, 4)>, <9, (3, 0, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 6)>, <9, (5, 3, 6)>, <9, (5, 0, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (8, 3, 6)>, <9, (8, 0, 6)>, <9, (8, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 0, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
