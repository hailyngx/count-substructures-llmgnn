Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 20) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (22, 27) (22, 21) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 21) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 15) (25, 14) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 9) (23, 26) (23, 13) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 16) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 25) (28, 2) (28, 0) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (15, 5) (15, 7) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 16) (12, 10) (12, 8) (24, 19) (24, 27) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 27) (13, 6) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 20) (20, 11) (20, 5) (20, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 18, 22, 5, 6, 2, 8, 4, 17, 7, 0, 29, 26, 21, 15, 19, 27, 16, 13, and 20.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
\( 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 60 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (17, 2, 10)>, <10, (11, 17, 0)>, <11, (17, 20, 29)>, <18, (4, 7, 16)>, <5, (6, 15, 20)>, <8, (2, 29, 12)>, <17, (1, 11, 21)>, <0, (10, 21, 29)>, <29, (7, 0, 13)>, <26, (21, 16, 17)>
