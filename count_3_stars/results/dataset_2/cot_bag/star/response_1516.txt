Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40.  
Putting the final number inside brackets []:
[40]

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
5. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
6. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <5, (0, 4, 7)>
9. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
10. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
11. <7, (0, 4, 5)>
12. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
13. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
14. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
