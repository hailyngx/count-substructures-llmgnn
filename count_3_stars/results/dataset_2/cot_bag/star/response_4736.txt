Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Calculating inom{n}{3} for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 also has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, contributing 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
