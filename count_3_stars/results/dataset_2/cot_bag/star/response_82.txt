Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 = 84 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 84, which can be represented as [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 12, 3)>, <0, (6, 12, 2)>, <0, (6, 3, 12)>, <0, (12, 3, 2)>, <0, (3, 12, 2)>, <1, (8, 13, 5)>, <2, (0, 14, 12)>, <2, (0, 14, 5)>, <2, (14, 12, 5)>, <3, (0, 12, 2)>, <4, (6, 10, 13)>, <4, (7, 10, 13)>, <4, (7, 10, 8)>, <4, (8, 10, 13)>, <4, (10, 13, 8)>, <7, (9, 10, 13)>, <7, (10, 13, 8)>, <8, (4, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 13, 1)>, <11, (9, 4, 0)>, <11, (9, 0, 2)>, <12, (6, 0, 3)>, <13, (7, 8, 1)>.
