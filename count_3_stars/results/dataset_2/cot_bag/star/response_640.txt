Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (15, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 6, 9, 4, 18, 7, 14, 12, 19, 5, and 17. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 38

So, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<16, (11, 5, 13)>
<6, (16, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 1, 14)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 14)>
<9, (6, 1, 14)>
<9, (6, 3, 18)>
<4, (6, 5, 18)>
<4, (6, 18, 17)>
<4, (6, 18, 17)>
<4, (6, 18, 17)>
<4, (6, 18, 17)>
<18, (4, 17, 3)>
<7, (0, 8, 14)>
<7, (0, 14, 19)>
<7, (0, 14, 19)>
<7, (0, 14, 19)>
<14, (9, 1, 2)>
<14, (9, 1, 2)>
<14, (9, 1, 2)>
