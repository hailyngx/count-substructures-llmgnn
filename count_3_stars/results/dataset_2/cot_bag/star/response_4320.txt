Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 94 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 14)>
<1, (11, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 13, 12)>
<5, (7, 6, 1)>
<6, (14, 10, 11)>
<8, (0, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<10, (6, 11, 2)>
<11, (1, 3, 6)>
<12, (8, 2, 14)>
<13, (7, 3, 0)>
<14, (0, 6, 12)>
