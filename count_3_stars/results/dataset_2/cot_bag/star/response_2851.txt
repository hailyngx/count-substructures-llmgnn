Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them.

In this graph, the nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- Node 1: 0 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 34

Therefore, there are [34] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 3)>
- <9, (2, 0, 3)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
