Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 which have 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 6, 11, and 18 which have 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 16 which has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with these nodes:
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 98 \]

So, there are a total of 98 3-stars in this graph. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 14)>, <5, (4, 12, 16)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (1, 6, 18)>, <10, (6, 17, 18)>, <11, (6, 7, 17)>, <12, (3, 5, 15)>, <13, (2, 14, 19)>, <14, (4, 13, 19)>, <15, (3, 12, 16)>, <16, (5, 10, 17)>, <18, (7, 8, 10)>
