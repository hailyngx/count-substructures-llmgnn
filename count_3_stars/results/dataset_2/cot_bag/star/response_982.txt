Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given edges:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The edges are:
(11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) 
(15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) 
(17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) 
(8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) 
(10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) 
(13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors

Now, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 32.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 10, 19)>
<1, (4, 13, 19)>
<1, (13, 15, 9)>
<1, (13, 4, 16)>
<1, (13, 18, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (10, 18, 8)>
<9, (8, 14, 15)>
<10, (0, 6, 12)>
<10, (0, 6, 5)>
<10, (2, 6, 12)>
<10, (2, 6, 5)>
<11, (0, 8, 16)>
<13, (1, 14, 15)>
<15, (3, 13, 9)>
<16, (1, 6, 11)>
<18, (1, 7, 8)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [32].
