Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14.

For each node, let's list its neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 12, 14
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8, 11
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 10, 12
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 10, 12
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8, 12
- Node 10: 3, 4, 13, 14
- Node 11: 2, 14
- Node 12: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 13: 10, 14
- Node 14: 1, 10, 11, 13

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 68

So, there are 68 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [68].
