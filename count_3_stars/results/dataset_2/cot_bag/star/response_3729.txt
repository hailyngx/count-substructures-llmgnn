Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: [1]
For Node 1: [3]
For Node 2: [3]
For Node 3: [3]
For Node 4: [1]
For Node 5: [3]
For Node 6: [3]
For Node 8: [3]
For Node 9: [1]

Summing up: [1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1] = [21]

Therefore, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 21.

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
