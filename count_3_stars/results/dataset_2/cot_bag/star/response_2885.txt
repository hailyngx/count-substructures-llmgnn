Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edge list, we can see that nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 13, 0, 14, 1, 11, 3, 2, and 10 have three or more neighbors.

We'll now calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 5. So, we have 10 3-stars with node 5.

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 9. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 9.

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 4. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 4.

4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 7. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 7.

5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 6. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 6.

6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 8. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 8.

7. Node 13 has 5 neighbors. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 13. So, we have 10 3-stars with node 13.

8. Node 0 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 0. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 0.

9. Node 14 has 5 neighbors. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 14. So, we have 10 3-stars with node 14.

10. Node 1 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 1. So, we have 4 3-stars with node 1.

11. Node 11 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.

12. Node 3 has 6 neighbors. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 3. So, we have 20 3-stars with node 3.

13. Node 2 has 5 neighbors. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 2. So, we have 10 3-stars with node 2.

14. Node 10 has 3 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with each node, we get a total of 94 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [94]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <5, (9, 13, 4)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <4, (5, 10, 1)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <6, (7, 1, 3)>, <8, (13, 14, 10)>, <13, (5, 8, 14)>, <0, (13, 14, 3)>, <14, (5, 8, 12)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, and <3, (9, 4, 6)>.
