Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (17, 18) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

The 20 nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}.

Here is how the edges are connected based on the given edge information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 15.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 10, 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 14, 15.
- Node 17 is connected to node 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 12, 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 11.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars and list them: 
Total number of 3-stars = [3 + 3 + 3] = [9]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 12)>
<1, (4, 9, 14)>
<2, (4, 8, 13)>
<3, (10, 14, 19)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (6, 10, 19)>
<7, (11, 15, 19)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<14, (1, 3, 10)>
