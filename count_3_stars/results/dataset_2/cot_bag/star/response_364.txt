Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 6: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 11: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 12: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 13: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 14: 3 choose 3 = 1

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 85

Therefore, there are 85 3-stars in this graph.

In the <> brackets, we list each unique 3-star found:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <1, (4, 9, 11)>, <1, (4, 9, 1)>, <1, (4, 9, 10)>, <1, (8, 3, 0)>, <1, (8, 3, 4)>, <1, (8, 0, 4)>, <1, (8, 1, 4)>, <1, (9, 11, 2)>, <1, (9, 11, 3)>, <1, (9, 11, 10)>, <1, (9, 10, 5)>, <2, (5, 13, 11)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 10)>, <4, (1, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (8, 0, 4)>, <4, (8, 3, 0)>, <4, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 11, 3)>, <4, (9, 11, 10)>, <4, (9, 10, 1)>, <5, (10, 1, 4)>, <8, (13, 11, 9)>
