Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 1, 0, 27, 23, 28, 29, 26, 13, 5, 17, 8, 19, 26, 18, 25, 9, and 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars found for each node, we get a total of 66 3-stars [66].
