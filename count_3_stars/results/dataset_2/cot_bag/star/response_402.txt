Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 4) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (8, 1) (8, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participates in.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, 11
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 4, 11
- Node 17 has neighbors 13, 6, 4
- Node 1 has neighbors 11, 19, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors 5, 17, 2, 13
- Node 3 has neighbors 7, 13, 19
- Node 16 has neighbors 0, 7, 15, 12
- Node 2 has neighbors 14, 6, 7, 10
- Node 12 has neighbors 14, 16, 10
- Node 11 has neighbors 5, 9, 1, 8, 18
- Node 4 has neighbors 9, 17, 15

Calculating the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participates in:
- Node 5 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 9 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 17 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 1 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 6 participates in 4 3-stars
- Node 3 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 16 participates in 4 3-stars
- Node 2 participates in 3 3-stars
- Node 12 participates in 1 3-star
- Node 11 participates in 5 3-stars
- Node 4 participates in 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in this graph.
