Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 17) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 8) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 25) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 18) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 26) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 16) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 10) (2, 21) (21, 20) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 21) (26, 4) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (6, 8) (6, 23) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (12, 1) (12, 9) (29, 25) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 23) (5, 15) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 1) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 29) (27, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 23) (9, 27) (10, 18) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 3 (each node forms 1 3-star)
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 
    - For nodes with 4 neighbors: 3-stars = (inom{4}{3}) = 4
    - Total 3-stars from these nodes = 4 * 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars = 3 + 40 = 43

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (16, 11, 10)>
<3, (28, 25, 20)>
<4, (9, 26, 13)>
<8, (6, 17, 3)>
<9, (4, 27, 23)>
<10, (18, 1, 25)>
<11, (19, 21, 13)>
<13, (22, 4, 11)>
<14, (7, 20, 17)>
<15, (16, 5, 20)>
<16, (29, 1, 15)>
<17, (14, 0, 8)>
<18, (25, 10, 22)>
<19, (11, 0, 3)>
<20, (21, 28, 15)>
<21, (2, 11, 20)>
<22, (13, 17, 27)>
<25, (3, 29, 10)>
<27, (9, 22, 29)>
<28, (21, 3, 20)>
<29, (23, 27, 16)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].
