Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 61 \)

Therefore, there are 61 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 14>, <3, 5, 14>, <5, 8, 10>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 9, 13>, <6, 9, 8>, <8, 5, 4>, <8, 5, 14>, <9, 0, 13>, <10, 7, 14>, <11, 1, 4>, <12, 7, 14>, <13, 11, 4>
