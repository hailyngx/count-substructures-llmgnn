Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 18) (6, 17) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 5) (18, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 16) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (7, 12, 16)>
  - <0, (7, 19, 16)>
  - <0, (7, 12, 19)>
  - <0, (16, 4, 19)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (4, 13, 15)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (2, 5, 10)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (1, 14, 16)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (0, 8, 19)>
  - <7, (0, 16, 19)>
  - <7, (0, 12, 19)>
  - <7, (0, 18, 19)>
  - <7, (2, 14, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 8, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 18, 7)>
  - <7, (8, 14, 7)>
  - <7, (8, 18, 7)>
  - <7, (18, 5, 7)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (11, 13, 16)>
  - <9, (11, 16, 19)>
  - <9, (13, 16, 19)>
  - <9, (16, 4, 19)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <10, (3, 13, 15)>
  - <10, (3, 15, 1)>
  - <10, (3, 11, 10)>
  - <10, (13, 15, 1)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <11, (9, 10, 13)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <14, (4, 8, 7)>
  - <14, (4, 17, 6)>
  - <14, (4, 7, 2)>
  - <14, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <14, (17, 6, 14)>
  - <14, (17, 19, 0)>
  - <14, (17, 19, 9)>
  - <14, (17, 6, 19)>
  - <14, (17, 14, 7)>
  - <14, (17, 14, 4)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <15, (1, 10, 13)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <16, (0, 9, 19)>
  - <16, (4, 9, 16)>
  - <16, (4, 9, 11)>
  - <16, (4, 16, 19)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <17, (14, 6, 19)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <19, (0, 9, 16)>
  - <19, (0, 9, 17)>
  - <19, (9, 16, 4)>
  - <19, (9, 16, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
