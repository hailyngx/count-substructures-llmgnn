Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 15) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 27) (7, 17) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 19) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 27) (4, 14) (8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 3) (0, 20) (0, 29) (20, 14) (20, 0) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 12) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 20) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 3) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 6) (27, 25) (27, 23) (3, 21) (3, 8) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 29) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 29) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 10) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (24, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:

- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
\[10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 39\]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 10, 21>
- <2, 12, 18>
- <3, 8, 21>
- <5, 2, 19>
- <8, 3, 29>
- <10, 1, 29>
- <11, 12, 28>
- <13, 16, 27>
- <14, 17, 19>
- <15, 16, 29>
- <17, 14, 23>
- <18, 2, 27>
- <19, 12, 24>
- <20, 0, 14>
- <21, 1, 29>
- <22, 11, 13>
- <24, 10, 25>
- <25, 23, 27>
- <26, 18, 3>
- <27, 18, 25>
- <28, 11, 9>
- <29, 0, 10>
