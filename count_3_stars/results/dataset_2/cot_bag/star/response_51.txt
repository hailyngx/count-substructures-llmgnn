Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 4, 8, 7, 12, 5, 6, 0, 14, 9, 11, 2, 10, 1, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 0: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 56

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<8, (4, 7, 12)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<12, (7, 10, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 11, 13)>
<0, (5, 11, 13)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (12, 11, 14)>
<11, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (0, 13, 14)>
<10, (4, 7, 12)>
<1, (4, 5, 12)>
<13, (0, 2, 6)>
