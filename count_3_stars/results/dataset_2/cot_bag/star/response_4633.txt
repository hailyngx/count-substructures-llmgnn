Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges is given by the edge list you provided. Let's determine the 3-stars present in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 5, 14. Thus, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (7, 12, 5)>, <0, (7, 12, 14)>, <0, (7, 5, 14)>, <0, (12, 5, 14)>.

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 11, 13. Thus, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (7, 2, 11)>, <1, (7, 2, 13)>, <1, (7, 11, 13)>, <1, (2, 11, 13)>.

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 10, 13. Thus, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (4, 8, 10)>, <3, (4, 8, 13)>, <3, (4, 10, 13)>, <3, (8, 10, 13)>.

4. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 12, 5, 14, 10, 13. Thus, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (12, 5, 14)>, <6, (12, 5, 10)>, <6, (12, 5, 13)>, <6, (12, 14, 10)>, <6, (12, 14, 13)>, <6, (12, 10, 13)>, <6, (5, 14, 10)>, <6, (5, 14, 13)>, <6, (5, 10, 13)>, <6, (14, 10, 13)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have \(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22\). 

Therefore, in total, there are [22] 3-stars in this graph.
