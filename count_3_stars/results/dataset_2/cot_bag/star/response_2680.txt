Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 9) (13, 11) (13, 15) (22, 16) (22, 3) (12, 20) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 7) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 20) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 12) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 24) (3, 11) (3, 22) (3, 8) (5, 11) (5, 29) (5, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 14) (21, 18) (8, 11) (8, 3) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 10) (18, 25) (23, 16) (23, 12) (23, 1) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 10) (4, 19) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 6) (25, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 18), (0, 6, 7), (0, 6, 18) - Total: 4
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6, 23) - Total: 1
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 10, 19) - Total: 1
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 1, 26), (6, 1, 0), (6, 1, 24), (6, 1, 25), (6, 4, 19) - Total: 5
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (10, 12, 20), (10, 12, 23), (10, 12, 2), (10, 12, 19) - Total: 4
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (11, 5, 29), (11, 5, 0), (11, 5, 8), (11, 3, 22), (11, 3, 8) - Total: 5
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (15, 20, 17), (15, 20, 29), (15, 20, 12), (15, 20, 2) - Total: 4
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (16, 22, 3), (16, 22, 9), (16, 22, 23), (16, 22, 11) - Total: 4
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 0, 5), (18, 0, 6), (18, 0, 21), (18, 0, 10) - Total: 4
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: (20, 12, 29), (20, 12, 23), (20, 12, 15), (20, 12, 17) - Total: 4

Adding all the totals together gives us 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [36].
