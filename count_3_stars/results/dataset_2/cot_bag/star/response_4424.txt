Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (5, 9, 19)>
- <0, (7, 12, 15)>
- <0, (7, 12, 4)>
- <3, (5, 6, 10)>
- <3, (5, 10, 13)>
- <3, (6, 10, 12)>
- <3, (6, 10, 13)>
- <4, (7, 12, 15)>
- <4, (7, 12, 0)>
- <4, (12, 15, 16)>
- <4, (12, 15, 0)>
- <5, (0, 7, 13)>
- <5, (0, 9, 19)>
- <5, (9, 16, 19)>
- <5, (9, 16, 15)>
- <8, (16, 2, 19)>
- <8, (16, 2, 8)>
- <8, (16, 19, 11)>
- <8, (16, 19, 15)>
- <9, (5, 16, 17)>
- <9, (5, 16, 15)>
- <9, (17, 1, 14)>
- <9, (17, 1, 18)>
- <11, (19, 8, 13)>
- <11, (19, 8, 16)>
- <11, (19, 16, 15)>
- <11, (19, 16, 0)>
- <12, (4, 7, 15)>
- <12, (4, 7, 0)>
- <12, (7, 0, 13)>
- <12, (7, 0, 4)>
- <13, (0, 19, 3)>
- <13, (0, 19, 11)>
- <13, (3, 6, 10)>
- <13, (3, 6, 5)>
- <15, (16, 4, 12)>
- <15, (16, 4, 0)>
- <16, (11, 8, 19)>
- <16, (11, 8, 15)>
- <16, (15, 4, 12)>
- <16, (15, 4, 0)>
- <19, (11, 16, 8)>
- <19, (11, 16, 15)>
- <19, (15, 4, 12)>
- <19, (15, 4, 0)>

This concludes the analysis for the given graph.
