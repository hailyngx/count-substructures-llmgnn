Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors.

Looking at the given edges, we can determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [56] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 3)>
- <0, (2, 5, 4)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 3)>
- <1, (5, 8, 3)>
- <2, (0, 9, 4)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <3, (1, 8, 5)>
- <3, (1, 8, 6)>
- <3, (7, 8, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 0)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>

- <8, (5, 9, 2)>
- <9, (5, 2, 4)>
