Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 4, 8, 6, 7, 0, 15, 14, 19, 2, 3, 17, 9, 18, 10. 
For these nodes, the number of 3-stars they form is calculated as follows:
 - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
 - Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
 - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
 - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
 - Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
 - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
 - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
 - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
 - Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: \(4+1+1+10+10+4+1+10+1+0+4+1+1 = 37\)

Therefore, in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, there are a total of [37] 3-stars. 

Unique 3-stars are: <4, (2, 3, 17)>, <4, (8, 1, 18)>, <4, (2, 14, 15)>, <4, (3, 19, 9)>, <8, (4, 1, 10)>, <6, (5, 0, 19)>, <7, (12, 17, 18)>, <15, (7, 0, 10)>, <15, (14, 2, 9)>, <19, (6, 7, 15)>.
