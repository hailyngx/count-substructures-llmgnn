Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 0) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 1 neighbor
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 3, 5, 12, 16, and 19 have 4 neighbors, so each one contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 4, 6, 11, 13, and 14 have 3 neighbors, so each one contributes 1 3-star.
 
Total number of 3-stars = \( 7\times4 + 6\times1 = 28 + 6 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 12, 16)>
<0, (2, 12, 19)>
<0, (2, 16, 19)>
<0, (12, 16, 19)>
<1, (3, 10, 16)>
<4, (5, 11, 14)>
<6, (4, 17, 0)>
<12, (3, 13, 0)>
<16, (1, 8, 15)>
<19, (9, 11, 3)>
