Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (9, 1, 2, 8)
- Node 1: (9, 6, 2, 0)
- Node 2: (5, 1, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 5: (9, 6, 2, 8, 7)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 1, 8)
- Node 8: (5, 3, 6, 2, 0)
- Node 9: (5, 3, 1, 0, 7)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <0, (9, 1, 8)>, <0, (9, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>
  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 6, 0)>, <1, (9, 2, 0)>, <1, (6, 2, 0)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>,
  <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>,
  <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <6, (5, 7, 1)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (7, 1, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (5, 3, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>,
  <8, (3, 6, 2)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 6, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <9, (5, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>,
  <9, (1, 0, 7)>, <9, (3, 0, 7)>, <9, (3, 8, 7)>, <9, (0, 8, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the final result is [52].
