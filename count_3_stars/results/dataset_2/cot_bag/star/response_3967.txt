Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 17) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 29) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 14) (20, 25) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (28, 11) (28, 23) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 5) (1, 19) (17, 26) (17, 2) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 4) (29, 27) (29, 18) (29, 22) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 6) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 14) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 16) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 6) (16, 25) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing these up: 

\( 4+4+4+4+1+1+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+1+4 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (27, 23, 12)>
<3, (27, 25, 14)>
<4, (22, 24, 12)>
<7, (15, 21, 18)>
<13, (21, 18, 12)>
<15, (27, 0, 13)>
<16, (25, 16, 6)>
<19, (1, 8, 6)>
<22, (5, 10, 29)>
<23, (28, 6, 0)>
<24, (26, 4, 0)>
<25, (20, 16, 3)>
<26, (17, 24, 9)>
<27, (15, 29, 0)>
<29, (18, 22, 27)>
