Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 11, 6, 7, and 17. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 15, and 3. The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is also $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 16, 15, 14, and 3. The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, and 13. Therefore, there is only one 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 0, 15, and 19. The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 15, and 14. The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 13, and 19. Therefore, there is only one 3-star with node 10 as the center.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 16, 0, and 13. Therefore, there is only one 3-star with node 11 as the center.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 11, 6, 10, and 18. The number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 16, 9, 1, and 5. The number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 19, and 5. The number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 11, 8, 14, and 5. The number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45\]

So, there are a total of 45 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ [45] \]
