Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 19) (10, 9) (10, 24) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 2) (28, 13) (28, 1) (29, 7) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 22) (26, 20) (26, 5) (26, 6) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 19) (6, 13) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 22) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 7) (18, 20) (18, 9) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 15) (24, 25) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 16) (0, 12) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 0) (22, 17) (22, 6) (22, 24) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 19) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 20, 25, 8, 13, 23, 10, 11, 28, 17, 26, 4, 6, 21, 5, 2, 12, 14, 9, 18, 16, 24, 7, 1, 15, 22, 3, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

There are a total of [26] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
