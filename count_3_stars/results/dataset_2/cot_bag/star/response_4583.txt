Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
The given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 12)
- (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 14)
- (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 14)
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 12)
- (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 11)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 14)
- (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 11)
- (7, 12)
- (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 12)
- (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 13)
- (10, 2), (10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 14)
- (11, 4), (11, 6)
- (12, 0), (12, 3), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 9)
- (13, 1), (13, 9)
- (14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 5), (14, 10)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [74].
