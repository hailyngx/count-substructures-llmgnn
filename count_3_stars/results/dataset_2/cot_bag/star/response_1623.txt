Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
