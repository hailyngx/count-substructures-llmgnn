Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 ] = [62] \]

Therefore, there are 62 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and they are:
