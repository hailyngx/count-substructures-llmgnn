Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph by following the instructions provided.

Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 86

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 13)>
- <0, (1, 6, 13)>
- <0, (4, 6, 13)>
- <1, (4, 13, 14)>
- <3, (11, 12, 14)>
- <3, (11, 9, 14)>
- <3, (12, 9, 14)>
- <7, (1, 13, 14)>
- <11, (3, 12, 14)>
