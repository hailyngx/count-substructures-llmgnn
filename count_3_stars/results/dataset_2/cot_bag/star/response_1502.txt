Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 14) (1, 16) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 4) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 2) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 13) (27, 23) (3, 10) (18, 5) (18, 29) (22, 12) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 24) (9, 14) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 10) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 4) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 25) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 5) (29, 18) (29, 24) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 8) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 13) (23, 27) (23, 28) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 2) (25, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (14, 13) (13, 27) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 14) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 29}

Edges: (0, 27), (0, 20), (0, 25), (0, 2), (1, 16), (1, 21), (2, 0), (2, 12), (2, 25), (3, 10), ..., (25, 15), (25, 0), (25, 26), (25, 2), ..., (28, 23), (29, 18), (29, 24)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, node 3 has 1 neighbor, and node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with these nodes.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, but there is only 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 5, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, and 27 all have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10, 15, 17, 23, and 28 each have 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with these nodes.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, but there is only 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Nodes 7, 8, 9, 13, and 29 have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we find that we have a total of 45 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
