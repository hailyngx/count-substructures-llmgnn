Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9, 12
- Node 1: 0, 6, 10
- Node 2: 7, 8, 12, 14
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 11, 14
- Node 4: 3, 10, 11, 14
- Node 5: 3, 8, 10
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9, 12
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 13
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8, 13
- Node 10: 1, 4, 5, 13
- Node 11: 3, 4, 12
- Node 12: 0, 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 13: 7, 9, 10
- Node 14: 2, 3, 4, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [10 choose 3] = 120
- Node 6: [10 choose 3] = 120
- Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 12: [10 choose 3] = 120
- Node 3: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 5: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 10: No 3-star
- Node 11: No 3-star
- Node 13: No 3-star
- Node 14: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars found = 120 + 120 + 4 + 4 + 120 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 384

Therefore, the final answer is [384] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (6, 8, 12)>
- <6, (0, 8, 12)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 12)>
- <12, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 10, 14)>
- <5, (3, 8, 10)>
- <14, (2, 3, 12)>
