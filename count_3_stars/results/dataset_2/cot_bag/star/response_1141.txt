Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 3, 8, 7, 4 (degree 5)
- Node 1: neighbors 6, 3, 4, 0 (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors 5, 7, 4 (degree 3)
- Node 3: neighbors 9, 1, 0, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors 5, 6, 1, 2, 0 (degree 5)
- Node 5: neighbors 9, 2, 8, 4 (degree 4)
- Node 6: neighbors 9, 1, 7, 8, 4 (degree 5)
- Node 7: neighbors 6, 2, 0 (degree 3)
- Node 8: neighbors 5, 6, 3, 0 (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors 5, 6, 3 (degree 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 38 3-stars. So, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
