Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of 83 3-stars.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [83].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
