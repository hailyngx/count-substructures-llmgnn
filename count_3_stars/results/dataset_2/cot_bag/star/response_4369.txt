Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes given are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars that can be formed.   

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 2, 7}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 3, 2}
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {9, 1, 6, 7, 0}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 0, 8, 4}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 3, 6}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {7, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {9, 3, 7}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 8, 2, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors:  

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0 (2, 3, 6)>, <0 (3, 6, 7)>, <0 (2, 6, 7)>, <0 (3, 2, 7)>

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <1 (5, 3, 2)>, <1 (5, 9, 3)>, <1 (5, 9, 2)>, <1 (9, 3, 2)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2 (9, 1, 6)>, <2 (1, 6, 7)>, <2 (9, 6, 7)>, <2 (1, 7, 0)>, <2 (6, 7, 0)>, <2 (9, 7, 0)>, <2 (1, 6, 0)>, <2 (9, 1, 7)>, <2 (9, 1, 0)>, <2 (6, 0, 7)>

- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <3 (1, 8, 4)>, <3 (1, 0, 4)>, <3 (8, 0, 4)>, <3 (1, 0, 8)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <4 (5, 3, 6)>, <4 (5, 3, 0)>, <4 (5, 6, 0)>, <4 (3, 6, 0)>

- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <7 (5, 6, 2)>, <7 (5, 8, 2)>, <7 (5, 6, 0)>, <7 (5, 2, 0)>, <7 (6, 2, 0)>, <7 (5, 6, 8)>, <7 (5, 2, 8)>, <7 (6, 0, 8)>, <7 (2, 0, 8)>, <7 (5, 0, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 36.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0 (2, 3, 6)>, <0 (3, 6, 7)>, <0 (2, 6, 7)>, <0 (3, 2, 7)>, <1 (5, 3, 2)>, <1 (5, 9, 3)>, <1 (5, 9, 2)>, <1 (9, 3, 2)>, <2 (9, 1, 6)>, <2 (1, 6, 7)>, <2 (9, 6, 7)>, <2 (1, 7, 0)>, <2 (6, 7, 0)>, <2 (9, 7, 0)>, <2 (1, 6, 0)>, <2 (9, 1, 7)>, <2 (9, 1, 0)>, <2 (6, 0, 7)>, <3 (1, 8, 4)>, <3 (1, 0, 4)>, <3 (8, 0, 4)>, <3 (1, 0, 8)>, <4 (5, 3, 6)>, <4 (5, 3, 0)>, <4 (5, 6, 0)>, <4 (3, 6, 0)>, <7 (5, 6, 2)>, <7 (5, 8, 2)>, <7 (5, 6, 0)>, <7 (5, 2, 0)>, <7 (6, 2, 0)>, <7 (5, 6, 8)>, <7 (5, 2, 8)>, <7 (6, 0, 8)>, <7 (2, 0, 8)>, <7 (5, 0, 8)>.
