Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 91.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [91], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>
