Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be illustrated as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Adding these up: \([10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4] = [62]\)

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>.
