Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented in list form as follows: \\
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph: \\
For each node, we'll check how many neighbors it has and compute the number of 3-stars originating from that node.

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
15. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all these, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 4 = 114 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 114. The unique 3-stars found are: \\
\[ <0, (4, 11, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 13)>, <0, (4, 11, 14)>, <0, (9, 11, 12)>, <0, (9, 11, 13)>, <0, (9, 11, 14)>, <1, (3, 7, 12)>, <1, (3, 7, 14)>, <2, (3, 8, 11)>, <3, (1, 7, 12)>, <3, (1, 7, 14)>, <3, (2, 8, 11)>, <4, (0, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 11, 12)>, <4, (9, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 11, 14)>, <5, (0, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 11, 13)>, <5, (0, 11, 14)>, <6, (11, 14, 6)>, <11, (0, 12, 5)>, <11, (0, 12, 7)>, <11, (0, 12, 9)>, <11, (4, 12, 5)>, <11, (4, 12, 7)>, <11, (4, 12, 9)> \]
