Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

We apply the combination formula:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Node 9 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the final answer is [61].
