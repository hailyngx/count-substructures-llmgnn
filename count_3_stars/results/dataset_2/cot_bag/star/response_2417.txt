Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
For node 0: It has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 1: It has neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 2: It has neighbors {3, 8, 9}, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 3: It has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 4: It has neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 5: It has neighbors {0, 1, 7}, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 6: It has neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 7: It has neighbors {4, 5, 3}, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 8: It has neighbors {6, 1, 2, 9}, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 9: It has neighbors {4, 6, 8, 0, 2}, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars generated by each node:
10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 49

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 0)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
