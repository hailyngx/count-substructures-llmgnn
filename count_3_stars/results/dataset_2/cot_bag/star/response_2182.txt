Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 15) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 10) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 11, 16, 14, 17, 8, 13, 5, 1, 15, and 10. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24 \).

Inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <11, 12, 16>
- <16, 1, 19>
- <16, 11, 18>
- <16, 19, 3>
- <14, 13, 17>
- <14, 5, 8>
- <14, 8, 17>
- <14, 8, 13>
- <17, 14, 3>
- <17, 7, 4>
- <8, 12, 10>
- <8, 2, 14>
- <8, 14, 5>
- <8, 2, 1>
- <13, 15, 1>
- <5, 14, 2>
- <5, 18, 7>
- <5, 7, 2>
- <1, 13, 16>
- <15, 9, 13>
- <10, 18, 7>
- <10, 4, 12>
- <10, 7, 18>
- <10, 4, 3>

These are the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the graph.
