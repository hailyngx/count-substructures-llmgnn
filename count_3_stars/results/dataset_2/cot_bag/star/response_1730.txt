Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, and 4 each can produce \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, 6, 7, and 8 each can produce \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 and 9 cannot produce any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 \times 10 + 4 \times 4 = 56 \), which can be represented as [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the final result is: [56].
