Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 15, 4, 29, 2, 20, 8, 18, 26, 11, 1, 6, 21, 23, 13, 12, 3, 0, 10, 24, 5.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- For node 15, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 29, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 20, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 18, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 26, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 11, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 21, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 23, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 12, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- For node 10, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 24, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-star counts, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].
