The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 26) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 28) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 7) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 5) (21, 3) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 2) (27, 8) (27, 25) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (16, 28) (10, 6) (10, 22) (12, 18) (12, 9) (20, 8) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 10) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 22) (2, 14) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 23) (23, 19) (23, 2) (22, 10) (22, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (14, 2), (15, 2), (25, 2), (23, 2).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (17, 3), (11, 3), (21, 3), (5, 3).
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (14, 4), (8, 4), (13, 4), (15, 4).
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (28, 5), (3, 5), (25, 5), (29, 5), (22, 5).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (26, 7), (0, 7), (7, 19), (7, 9).
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (14, 8), (4, 8), (27, 8), (8, 20), (8, 18).
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (17, 11), (28, 11), (13, 11), (6, 11).
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (14, 13), (4, 13), (11, 13), (18, 13), (13, 4).
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (17, 14), (8, 14), (2, 14), (13, 14).
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (4, 15), (8, 15), (2, 15).
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (8, 18), (15, 18), (12, 18), (13, 18).
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (29, 19), (7, 19), (23, 19).
Node 22 has 2 neighbors: (10, 22), (5, 22).
Node 23 has 2 neighbors: (2, 23), (19, 23).
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: (5, 25), (27, 25), (2, 25).
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (17, 26), (24, 26), (7, 26).
Node 28 has 5 neighbors: (11, 28), (28, 16), (28, 9), (28, 24), (28, 5).
Node 29 has 4 neighbors: (4, 29), (0, 29), (29, 19), (29, 5).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 13: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 19: 3 choose 3 = 1
Node 25: 3 choose 3 = 1
Node 26: 3 choose 3 = 1
Node 28: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 29: 4 choose 3 = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].
