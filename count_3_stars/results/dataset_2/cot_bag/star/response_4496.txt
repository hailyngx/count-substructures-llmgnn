Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors  

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 52 \)

Therefore, there are 52 3-stars in the graph provided.  

Putting this number inside brackets []: [52]  
Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<1, (0, 3, 8)>  
<1, (2, 3, 8)>  
<1, (5, 4, 7)>  
<2, (1, 8, 7)>  
<3, (1, 7, 8)>  
<3, (4, 5, 8)>  
<3, (6, 1, 2)>  
<3, (6, 8, 7)>  
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
