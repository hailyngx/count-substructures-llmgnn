Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 18) (0, 13) (14, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 4) (19, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 18, 7, 2, 15, 8, 13, 4, 10, 5.

For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<11, (3, 7, 17)>, <11, (7, 17, 18)>, <11, (3, 17, 18)>, <11, (7, 17, 18)>.

For node 16, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<16, (1, 15, 19)>, <16, (1, 15, 17)>, <16, (1, 15, 7)>, <16, (15, 17, 19)>.

For node 18, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
<18, (0, 13, 2)>, <18, (0, 13, 10)>, <18, (0, 13, 17)>, <18, (0, 13, 7)>, <18, (0, 2, 10)>, <18, (0, 7, 2)>, <18, (0, 13, 7)>, <18, (2, 7, 13)>, <18, (2, 10, 7)>, <18, (2, 13, 7)>.

For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<7, (12, 15, 8)>, <7, (15, 12, 8)>, <7, (15, 12, 4)>, <7, (15, 12, 9)>.

For node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<2, (5, 8, 18)>, <2, (5, 8, 4)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <2, (8, 18, 5)>.

For node 15, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<15, (7, 12, 9)>, <15, (7, 12, 4)>, <15, (7, 12, 15)>, <15, (12, 9, 7)>.

For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 12)>.

For node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<13, (0, 9, 18)>, <13, (0, 9, 17)>, <13, (0, 9, 13)>, <13, (9, 13, 17)>.

For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<4, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (5, 6, 12)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 10, 12)>.

For node 10, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<10, (3, 4, 18)>, <10, (3, 4, 5)>, <10, (3, 4, 6)>, <10, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 5, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47 \).  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [47].
