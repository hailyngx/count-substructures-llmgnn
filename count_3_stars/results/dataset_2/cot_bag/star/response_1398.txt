Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 1) (10, 22) (10, 11) (10, 27) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 25) (11, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 21) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 9) (23, 11) (23, 26) (3, 28) (3, 6) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 3) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 16) (24, 7) (24, 0) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 6) (5, 22) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 15) (14, 18) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 21) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 22) (20, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 18) 

Response:
There are five nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 7, 11, 26, and 27. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (7, 25, 29)>, <7, (4, 15, 24)>, <11, (10, 23, 27)>, <26, (1, 19, 28)>, <27, (10, 12, 20)>.
