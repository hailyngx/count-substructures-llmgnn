Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
To construct the graph with the given nodes and edges, we first represent the nodes and their connections based on the provided edge list:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 2, 7, 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, 0, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 8, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 3, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 0, 3, 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 1, 0

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars and count their total. Calculating the number of 3-stars originating from each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the 3-stars from each of these nodes: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52

So, there are a total of 52 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:

[<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>]
