Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 17) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 6) 

Response:
We can start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of the 3-star graphs. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, and 19.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 51 3-stars.
Thus, the answer is [51].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, 4, 19>

<1, 12, 6>
