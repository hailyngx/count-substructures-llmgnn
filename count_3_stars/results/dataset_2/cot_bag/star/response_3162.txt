Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Node 0 and Node 5 are the only nodes with three neighbors. So we have 2 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
