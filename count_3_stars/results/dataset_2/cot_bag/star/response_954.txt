Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 13) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 2 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [17]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (6, 7, 14)>
<2, (5, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<5, (1, 8, 2)>
<6, (10, 7, 12)>
<7, (3, 6, 12)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<12, (1, 6, 2)>
<14, (9, 0, 4)>
<14, (11, 0, 2)>
<14, (0, 2, 5)>
<14, (4, 2, 9)>
