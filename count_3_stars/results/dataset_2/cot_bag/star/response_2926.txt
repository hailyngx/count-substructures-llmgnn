Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 22) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 23) (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 28) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 1) (21, 17) (10, 24) (11, 19) (11, 17) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 6) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 17) (5, 23) (5, 3) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 0) (1, 21) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 23) (17, 24) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 29) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (20, 29) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 3) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 17) (25, 15) (25, 13) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 16) (2, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<7, (0, 15, 18)>  
<13, (22, 29, 0)>  
<16, (18, 12, 3)>  
<17, (21, 11, 24)>  
<18, (9, 15, 19)>  
<19, (11, 28, 3)>  
<21, (7, 1, 17)>  
<23, (27, 8, 17)>  
<24, (7, 10, 17)>  
<28, (27, 22, 19)>
