Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 6, 9, 1, 4, 8, 2, 0, and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>
