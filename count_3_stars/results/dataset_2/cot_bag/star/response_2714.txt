Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 27) (17, 10) (17, 24) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 7) (21, 0) (28, 14) (28, 13) (26, 25) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 16) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 4) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 1) (3, 22) (3, 27) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 27) (7, 1) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 25) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (0, 21) (0, 6) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 13) (25, 26) (25, 18) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 14) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are 30 nodes and 90 edges in this graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 23, 8, 18, 7, 29
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 16, 14, 25
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 5, 12
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 23, 15, 29, 0
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 10, 20, 27, 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 10, 19, 16, 1
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 11, 17, 8, 7
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 10, 27, 13
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 11, 28, 24, 14
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 28, 2, 25, 13
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 20, 18, 6, 16
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 15, 8, 19, 2
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 15, 25, 1
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 22, 15, 7
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 23, 20, 3
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 22, 1, 6, 27
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 26, 18, 29, 2, 14
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 11, 23, 3, 7
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 25

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
