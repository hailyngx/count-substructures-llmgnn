Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 10) (15, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 16) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 17) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 18) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 29) (26, 14) (4, 12) (4, 24) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 22) (12, 8) (1, 25) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 8) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 14) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (0, 12) (0, 22) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 15) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 19) (18, 21) (18, 24) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 18) (22, 29) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 16) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 7) (19, 28) (19, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 

Node 2 (neighbors: 29, 27, 28, 25)  
Node 3 (neighbors: 25, 11, 23)  
Node 6 (neighbors: 5, 9, 23, 8)  
Node 7 (neighbors: 29, 28, 27, 17, 8)  
Node 8 (neighbors: 5, 6, 12, 7)  
Node 12 (neighbors: 4, 22, 0, 8)  
Node 13 (neighbors: 20, 21, 14)  
Node 16 (neighbors: 20, 22, 19)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars found are: <2, (29, 27, 28)>, <2, (29, 27, 25)>, <2, (29, 28, 25)>, <2, (27, 28, 25)>, <6, (5, 9, 23)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 23, 8)>, <6, (9, 23, 8)>, <7, (29, 28, 27)>, <7, (29, 28, 17)>, <7, (29, 27, 17)>, <7, (28, 27, 17)>, <7, (29, 27, 7)>, <7, (28, 27, 7)>, <7, (28, 17, 7)>, <27, (9, 2, 7)>, <27, (2, 28, 7)>, <16, (20, 22, 19)>, <16, (20, 19, 22)>
