Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28

So, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (15, 17, 18)>, <5, (4, 17, 18)>, <6, (2, 7, 5)>, <11, (7, 13, 16)>, <13, (11, 15, 4)>, <16, (0, 12, 11)>, <18, (3, 5, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
