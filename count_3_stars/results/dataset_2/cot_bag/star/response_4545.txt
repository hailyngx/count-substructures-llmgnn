Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 3, 0, 2, 1, 8, 13, and 14.   
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 9) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 10) + 4 (from Node 11) + 1 (from Node 12) + 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 0) + 20 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 13) + 1 (from Node 14) = 73

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 73.
