Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 50

Thus, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<3, (4, 2, 7)>
<3, (7, 5, 4)>
<4, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (5, 0, 9)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 4)>
