Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
In this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 8 has neighbors: 13, 4, 2, 5, 14
- Node 13 has neighbors: 8, 5, 2, 9, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 10, 11, 6
- Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 12, 4, 9
- Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 3, 1, 6, 12, 4
- Node 6 has neighbors: 13, 11, 4, 0, 14
- Node 9 has neighbors: 13, 10, 0, 3, 1

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (13, 4, 2)>, <8, (13, 4, 5)>, <8, (13, 2, 5)>, <8, (13, 2, 14)>, <8, (13, 5, 14)>
  - <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 14)>, <8, (4, 5, 14)>, <8, (2, 5, 14)>
  - <8, (13, 4, 2, 5)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (8, 5, 2)>, <13, (8, 5, 9)>, <13, (8, 5, 6)>, <13, (8, 2, 9)>, <13, (8, 2, 6)>
  - <13, (5, 2, 9)>, <13, (5, 2, 6)>, <13, (5, 9, 6)>, <13, (8, 5, 2, 9)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (8, 10, 11)>, <4, (8, 11, 6)>, <4, (10, 11, 6)>, <4, (8, 11, 4)>, <4, (10, 11, 4)>
  - <4, (10, 11, 6)>, <4, (8, 10, 4, 11)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <10, (11, 4, 9)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (10, 3, 1)>, <11, (10, 3, 6)>, <11, (10, 1, 6)>, <11, (10, 1, 4)>, <11, (10, 6, 4)>
  - <11, (10, 1, 6)>, <11, (10, 3, 1, 6)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (13, 11, 4)>, <6, (13, 11, 0)>, <6, (13, 11, 14)>, <6, (13, 4, 0)>, <6, (13, 4, 14)>
  - <6, (13, 11, 0, 14)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (13, 10, 0)>, <9, (13, 10, 3)>, <9, (13, 10, 1)>, <9, (13, 0, 3)>, <9, (13, 0, 1)>
  - <9, (13, 10, 0, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10] = [84] \).
