Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 2, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 8, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 1}
- Node 6: {8, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 7, 0, 1}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0: 1 3-star
- For Node 1: 4 3-stars
- For Node 2: 5 3-stars
- For Node 3: 1 3-star
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 7: 2 3-stars
- For Node 8: 4 3-stars
- For Node 9: 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (8, 2, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<2, (8, 7, 0)>
<2, (7, 0, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 2)>
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 1, 4)>
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
