Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 8) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 1) (26, 6) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 22) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 24) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 22) (29, 18) (29, 10) (22, 25) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 13) (27, 25) (27, 5) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (10, 29) (10, 0) (10, 18) (2, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 11) (24, 15) (24, 28) (6, 26) (6, 23) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 14) (7, 8) (14, 13) (14, 23) (23, 15) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 13) (23, 14) (4, 13) (4, 19) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 4) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 10) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
2. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
5. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
7. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
9. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
10. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
13. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
15. Node 28: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
16. Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up:
\( 3 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 2 + 10 = 93 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 93 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [93]
