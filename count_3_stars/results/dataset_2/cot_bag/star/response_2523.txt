Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 5 neighbors.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.  
Node 10 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 14 has 6 neighbors.  

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 62
\]

Therefore, there are [62] 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
