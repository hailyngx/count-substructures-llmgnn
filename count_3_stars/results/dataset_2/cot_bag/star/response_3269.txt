Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 15) (13, 10) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 18) (12, 25) (12, 17) (12, 23) (27, 14) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 9) (1, 4) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 7) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 15) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 25) (18, 9) (18, 21) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 24) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 23) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 23) (4, 1) (4, 17) (21, 9) (21, 18) (10, 13) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 7) (14, 29) (14, 27) (14, 15) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 6) (23, 7) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 29, 8, 13, 20, 25, 12, 27, 28, 3, 26, 22, 9, 18, 16, 24, 5, 0, 6, 7, 4, 21, 10, 14, 23, and 15.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of 26 3-stars [26].
