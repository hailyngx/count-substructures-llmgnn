Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 16) (0, 14) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<2, (5, 11, 13)>
<2, (5, 11, 12)>
<2, (11, 13, 7)>
<2, (13, 7, 12)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<6, (5, 7, 12)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 19, 7)>
<6, (19, 10, 1)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
<7, (9, 6, 13)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<9, (8, 18, 7)>
<9, (8, 11, 6)>
<9, (8, 19, 7)>
<9, (11, 18, 15)>

For node 10:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
<10, (18, 1, 19)>

For node 11:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<11, (15, 8, 12)>
<11, (15, 13, 18)>
<11, (8, 19, 12)>
<11, (8, 2, 15)>

For node 13:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<13, (4, 15, 7)>
<13, (4, 16, 2)>
<13, (15, 18, 11)>
<13, (4, 2, 16)>

For node 14:
Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 15:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
<15, (18, 11, 13)>

For node 16:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
<16, (18, 4, 14)>

For node 17:
Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 18:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
<18, (16, 15, 10)>
<18, (16, 14, 4)>
<18, (15, 11, 9)>
<18, (16, 10, 14)>

For node 19:
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
<19, (17, 1, 10)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
\(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24\) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
