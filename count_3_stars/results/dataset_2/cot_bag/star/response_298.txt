Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 2, 5)>

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 9, 8)> 
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)> 
  - <2, (5, 6, 3)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 8, 9)> 
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)> 

- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>

- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>

- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 2)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 2, 8)>
  - <5, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (3, 6, 2)>
  - <5, (6, 8, 2)>
  - <5, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 6, 8)>

- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>

- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 9, 2)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 9)>

- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (5, 9, 2)>

- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (2, 7, 1)>
  - <9, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (5, 7, 2)>

Adding up all the 3-stars forms a total of [56] unique 3-stars in the graph.
