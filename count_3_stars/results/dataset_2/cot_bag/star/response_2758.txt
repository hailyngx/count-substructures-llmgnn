Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph with 5 or more neighbors: node 4, node 5, and node 3.

For node 4:
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: nodes 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and 6.
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20\]

For node 5:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 6, 2, 8, 1, and 3.
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10\]

For node 3:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 4, 6, and 8.
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10\]

Adding these up, we have a total of 40 possible 3-stars in this graph.
Inside brackets: [40]
Unique 3-stars found: <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>
