Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 6) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 14) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 4) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 5) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
