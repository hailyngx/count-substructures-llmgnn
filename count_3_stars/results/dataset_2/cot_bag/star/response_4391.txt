Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0: {7, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 4, 1, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (5, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<0, (7, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
