Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 8) (0, 17) (0, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 1) (19, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node, we have:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 0
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 2

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <1, (14, 6, 19)>
  - <1, (14, 6, 17)>
  - <1, (14, 6, 12)>
  - <1, (14, 6, 17)>

- Node 2: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <2, (8, 18, 10)>
  - <2, (8, 18, 7)>
  - <2, (8, 18, 10)>
  - <2, (8, 18, 7)>

- Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <6, (14, 17, 1)>
  - <6, (14, 17, 12)>
  - <6, (14, 17, 1)>
  - <6, (14, 17, 12)>

- Node 8: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <8, (4, 12, 18)>
  - <8, (4, 12, 2)>
  - <8, (4, 12, 18)>
  - <8, (4, 12, 2)>

- Node 9: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <9, (14, 0, 19)>
  - <9, (14, 0, 12)>
  - <9, (14, 0, 19)>
  - <9, (14, 0, 12)>

- Node 10: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
  - <10, (8, 2, 15)>
  - <10, (8, 2, 13)>
  - <10, (8, 2, 5)>
  - <10, (8, 2, 15)>
  - <10, (8, 2, 13)>
  - <10, (8, 2, 5)>
  - <10, (13, 15, 5)>
  - <10, (13, 15, 7)>
  - <10, (13, 15, 5)>
  - <10, (13, 15, 7)>

- Node 12: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
  - <12, (4, 13, 6)>
  - <12, (4, 13, 16)>
  - <12, (4, 13, 9)>
  - <12, (4, 13, 16)>
  - <12, (4, 13, 6)>
  - <12, (13, 15, 7)>
  - <12, (13, 15, 6)>
  - <12, (13, 15, 9)>
  - <12, (13, 15, 6)>
  - <12, (13, 15, 7)>

- Node 17: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
  - <17, (14, 6, 1)>
  - <17, (14, 6, 0)>
  - <17, (14, 6, 1)>
  - <17, (14, 6, 0)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 40 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
