Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 8, 10, 14, 0, 13, 18, 9, 1, 11, 6, and 2.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \text{15 choose 3} = 455 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{3 choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \text{5 choose 3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \text{3 choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \text{5 choose 3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \text{3 choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \text{3 choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{4 choose 3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 455 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 497 \)

So, there are 497 3-stars in this graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 7, 11>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 0>, <7, 10, 8>, <7, 10, 0>, <10, 0, 8>, <14, 0, 18>, <14, 0, 1>, <14, 0, 2>, <13, 17, 5>, <13, 17, 12>, <17, 3, 9>, <9, 15, 1>, <6, 11, 16>, <6, 11, 2>, <6, 11, 18>, <6, 16, 12>, <6, 16, 18>, <6, 16, 2>, <1, 11, 19> 

Therefore, there are  twenty-three unique 3-stars presented in this graph, as  [497].
