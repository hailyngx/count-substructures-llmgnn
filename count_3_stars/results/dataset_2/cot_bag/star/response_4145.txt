Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (12, 6) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 15)

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating for node 0:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 0} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 0: 
<0, (5, 10, 16)>, <0, (5, 10, 6)>, <0, (10, 16, 6)>, <0, (5, 16, 6)>

Calculating for node 1:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 1} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 1: 
<1, (10, 6, 19)>, <1, (10, 14, 19)>, <1, (6, 14, 19)>, <1, (10, 6, 14)>

Calculating for node 2:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 2} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 2: 
<2, (5, 11, 16)>, <2, (5, 16, 2)>, <2, (11, 16, 2)>, <2, (5, 11, 2)>

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 3} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 3: 
<3, (8, 13, 17)>

Calculating for node 6:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 6} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 6: 
<6, (1, 10, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 8)>, <6, (10, 8, 6)>, <6, (1, 14, 8)>

Calculating for node 8:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 8} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 8: 
<8, (3, 10, 6)>

Calculating for node 9:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 9} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 9: 
<9, (11, 13, 7)>

Calculating for node 10:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 10} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 10: 
<10, (17, 0, 8)>, <10, (17, 1, 6)>, <10, (0, 1, 6)>, <10, (17, 1, 8)>

Calculating for node 11:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 11} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 11: 
<11, (9, 2, 15)>, <11, (9, 4, 15)>, <11, (2, 4, 15)>, <11, (9, 2, 4)>

Calculating for node 13:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 13} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 13: 
<13, (9, 14, 15)>, <13, (9, 14, 15)>, <13, (14, 15, 18)>, <13, (14, 15, 11)>

Calculating for node 14:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 14} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 14: 
<14, (1, 18, 15)>, <14, (1, 13, 15)>, <14, (18, 15, 11)>, <14, (13, 15, 11)>

Calculating for node 15:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 15} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3-stars at node 15: 
<15, (18, 14, 11)>, <15, (18, 14, 13)>, <15, (14, 13, 11)>, <15, (18, 13, 11)>

Calculating for node 16:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 16} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 16: 
<16, (2, 19, 0)>

Calculating for node 17:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 17} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 17: 
<17, (5, 10, 3)>

Calculating for node 19:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars at node 19} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
3-stars at node 19: 
<19, (1, 16, 6)>

Counting all unique 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].
