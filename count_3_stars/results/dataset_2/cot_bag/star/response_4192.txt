Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, and 5.
For node 0: There are 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: There are 6 neighbors, so there are also \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: There are 3 neighbors, so there's 1 3-star.
Thus, there are a total of \( 20 + 20 + 1 = 41 \) 3-stars. 

Putting the final answer inside brackets gives us [41].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, and <5, (6, 9, 4)>.
