Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with degree 3 or more are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (6, 4, 3)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 8, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (9, 6, 7)>

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 1)>, 
<3, (2, 1, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 1)>, <3, (8, 1, 9)>, <3, (7, 1, 9)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>

Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, 
<5, (6, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (5, 2, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 1, 7)>

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>

There's a total of 40 3-stars in this graph, so the final count is [40].
