Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 9) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 4) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 18) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 0) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 10, 12, 19}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 13, 18, 4}
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {2, 5, 10, 19, 8}
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {1, 8, 14, 5, 0}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {11, 4, 18, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (1, 10, 12)>
  - <3, (1, 10, 19)>
  - <3, (1, 12, 19)>
  - <3, (10, 12, 19)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (1, 13, 18)>
  - <8, (1, 13, 4)>
  - <8, (1, 18, 4)>
  - <8, (13, 18, 4)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (2, 5, 10)>
  - <13, (2, 5, 19)>
  - <13, (2, 10, 19)>
  - <13, (5, 10, 19)>
  - <13, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <13, (2, 10, 8)>
  - <13, (2, 19, 8)>
  - <13, (5, 10, 8)>
  - <13, (5, 19, 8)>
  - <13, (10, 19, 8)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <18, (1, 8, 14)>
  - <18, (1, 8, 5)>
  - <18, (1, 14, 5)>
  - <18, (8, 14, 5)>
  - <18, (1, 5, 0)>
  - <18, (1, 8, 0)>
  - <18, (1, 14, 0)>
  - <18, (8, 14, 0)>
  - <18, (5, 14, 0)>
  - <18, (5, 8, 0)>

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (4, 18, 1)>
  - <0, (4, 1, 11)>
  - <0, (18, 1, 11)>
  - <0, (18, 4, 1)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32 \)
Thus, there are 32 unique 3-stars in this graph: <3, (1, 10, 12)>, <3, (1, 10, 19)>, <3, (1, 12, 19)>, <3, (10, 12, 19)>, <8, (1, 13, 18)>, <8, (1, 13, 4)>, <8, (1, 18, 4)>, 
<8, (13, 18, 4)>, <13, (2, 5, 10)>, <13, (2, 5, 19)>, <13, (2, 10, 19)>, <13, (5, 10, 19)>, <13, (2, 5, 8)>, <13, (2, 10, 8)>, <13, (2, 19, 8)>, <13, (5, 10, 8)>, <13, (5, 19, 8)>, <13, (10, 19, 8)>, 
<18, (1, 8, 14)>, <18, (1, 8, 5)>, <18, (1, 14, 5)>, <18, (8, 14, 5)>, <18, (1, 5, 0)>, <18, (1, 8, 0)>, <18, (1, 14, 0)>, <18, (8, 14, 0)>, <18, (5, 14, 0)>, <18, (5, 8, 0)>, 
<0, (4, 18, 1)>, <0, (4, 1, 11)>, <0, (18, 1, 11)>, <0, (18, 4, 1)>
