Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (16, 20) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 13) (2, 22) (2, 12) (18, 17) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (22, 16) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 5) (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 13) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 6) (13, 23) (13, 1) (13, 12) (17, 18) (17, 3) (21, 27) (21, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 3) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (19, 8) (19, 29) (19, 27) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 25) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 25) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 26) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 20) (26, 27) (26, 29) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 26) (5, 0) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 20) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 28, 24, 5
- Node 1: 15, 28, 13
- Node 2: 22, 12
- Node 3: 17, 4, 12, 29
- Node 4: 9, 12, 28, 3
- Node 5: 22, 21, 20, 0
- Node 6: 14, 10, 25
- Node 8: 23, 19
- Node 9: 22, 4
- Node 10: 15, 6
- Node 11: 16
- Node 12: 16, 2, 13, 4, 3
- Node 13: 23, 1, 12
- Node 14: 6, 20, 29
- Node 15: 23, 1, 10
- Node 16: 11, 12, 22, 20
- Node 17: 18, 3
- Node 18: 17
- Node 19: 8, 29, 27
- Node 20: 16, 14, 27, 24, 5
- Node 21: 27, 5
- Node 22: 16, 2, 9, 5
- Node 23: 8, 15, 24, 13
- Node 24: 23, 0, 20
- Node 25: 6, 29, 28
- Node 26: 27, 29
- Node 27: 21, 19, 20, 26
- Node 28: 0, 1, 4, 25
- Node 29: 14, 19, 3, 25, 26

Now, we will find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4, Node 12, and Node 22 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 27, and Node 29 have more than 3 neighbors as well, but they have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{t} = 0 \) 3-stars each where \( t < 3 \).

Adding up the number of 3-stars from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we get \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (9, 12, 3)>
- <12, (16, 2, 13)>
- <22, (16, 9, 5)>
- <0, (24, 5, 28)>
- <1, (15, 13, 28)>
- <13, (23, 1, 12)>
- <15, (23, 10, 1)>
- <16, (11, 12, 20)>
- <19, (27, 20, 29)>
