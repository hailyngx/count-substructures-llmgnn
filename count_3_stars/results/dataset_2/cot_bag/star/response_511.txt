Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 13) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
\[
[6]
\]

<5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 13)>, <10, (12, 14, 8)>  
Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, we have [3].
