Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Nodes 9, 10, 12, 13, 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

Therefore, there are 50 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<8, (0, 1, 13)>
<9, (6, 10, 12)>
<10, (1, 4, 11)>
<12, (1, 2, 14)>
<13, (0, 3, 8)>
<14, (2, 5, 12)>

So the final answer is [50].
