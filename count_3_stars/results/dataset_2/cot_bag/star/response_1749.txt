Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 17) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (14, 4) (19, 4) (19, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 10, 11, 1, 13, 4, 7, and 15.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 13, 8)>, <5, (6, 18, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 13)>, <5, (6, 3, 18)>, <5, (6, 3, 13)>, <5, (9, 10, 0)>, <5, (13, 11, 17)>, <5, (5, 10, 8)>, <5, (10, 11, 17)>, <5, (13, 11, 7)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 10, 8)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (10, 6, 0)>, <9, (10, 11, 0)>

Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<10, (9, 11, 0)>, <10, (6, 15, 0)>, <10, (11, 13, 17)>, <10, (11, 15, 1)>, <10, (6, 15, 1)>, <10, (15, 7, 16)>, <10, (11, 7, 1)>, <10, (6, 7, 15)>, <10, (15, 1, 16)>, <10, (6, 11, 0)>

Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<11, (1, 13, 7)>, <11, (13, 4, 17)>, <11, (1, 3, 7)>, <11, (3, 4, 1)>, <11, (7, 15, 17)>, <11, (3, 7, 4)>, <11, (4, 15, 12)>, <11, (7, 15, 1)>, <11, (15, 7, 16)>, <11, (4, 12, 1)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (11, 7, 17)>, <1, (7, 4, 12)>, <1, (11, 13, 7)>, <1, (4, 15, 12)>

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (11, 1, 17)>, <13, (5, 11, 17)>, <13, (11, 17, 7)>, <13, (5, 11, 7)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (15, 12, 19)>, <4, (15, 1, 12)>, <4, (1, 7, 12)>, <4, (15, 7, 12)>

Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<7, (11, 7, 1)>, <7, (11, 15, 16)>, <7, (11, 15, 17)>, <7, (11, 1, 17)>, <7, (15, 4, 16)>, <7, (15, 19, 16)>, <7, (4, 1, 12)>, <7, (15, 1, 16)>, <7, (15, 19, 4)>, <7, (1, 16, 12)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (10, 16, 7)>, <15, (10, 1, 16)>, <15, (10, 7, 16)>, <15, (10, 4, 16)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60\)

Therefore, there are 60 3-stars in the given graph.
