Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), 
(9, 5), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), 
(4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 14), (4, 11), 
(7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 6), 
(10, 9), (10, 2), 
(11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 14), (11, 13), 
(6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), 
(2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), 
(8, 14), (8, 12), 
(0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 1), 
(14, 4), (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 8), (14, 12), 
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 13), (1, 12), 
(12, 2), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 14), (12, 1), (12, 13), 
(13, 4), (13, 11), (13, 1), (13, 12), (13, 3), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 13)

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars: 

For node 0: [5 choose 3] = 10
For node 1: [6 choose 3] = 20
For node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
For node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
For node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4
For node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4
For node 12: [6 choose 3] = 20
For node 13: [4 choose 3] = 4
For node 14: [5 choose 3] = 10

Summing up, we get the total number of 3-stars: 
10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 12, 14)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 13)>, <1, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 13)>, <4, (11, 13, 14)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 10)>, <10, (2, 9, 12)>, <11, (4, 7, 14)>, <12, (0, 1, 14)>, <13, (1, 3, 12)>
