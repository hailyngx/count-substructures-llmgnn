Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (12, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5, node 4, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5:
There are 5 edges connected to node 5, giving it 5 neighbors.
Number of 3-stars for node 5 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 5: 
<5, (9, 12, 0)> 
<5, (9, 12, 10)> 
<5, (9, 0, 10)> 
<5, (12, 0, 10)> 
<5, (9, 12, 14)> 
<5, (9, 0, 14)> 
<5, (9, 10, 14)> 
<5, (12, 0, 14)> 
<5, (12, 10, 14)> 
<5, (0, 10, 14)>

For node 4:
There are 4 edges connected to node 4, giving it 4 neighbors.
Number of 3-stars for node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 4:
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 14, 2)>
<4, (14, 6, 2)>

For node 9:
There are 4 edges connected to node 9, giving it 4 neighbors.
Number of 3-stars for node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 9:
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 13, 0)>
<9, (1, 13, 0)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 9) = 18

Therefore, there are a total of 18 3-stars in this graph, giving us the final count: [18].
