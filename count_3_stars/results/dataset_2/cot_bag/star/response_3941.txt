Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 10) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 6) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 19) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 24) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 4) (28, 27) (28, 24) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 3) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 15) (19, 27) (19, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 24) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 27) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 5) (4, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (10, 2) (10, 29) (10, 23) (10, 26) (3, 14) (3, 26) (3, 24) (7, 20) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 7) (20, 18) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 3) (12, 8) (25, 26) (25, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Edges: (0, 16), (0, 24), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 27), (2, 29), (2, 1), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 14), (3, 26), (3, 24), (4, 21), (5, 29), (5, 0), (5, 23), (5, 15), (6, 13), (6, 22), (7, 20), (8, 13), (8, 23), (8, 9), (8, 12), (9, 2), (9, 8), (9, 19), (9, 24), (10, 2), (10, 29), (10, 23), (10, 26), (11, 16), (11, 15), (12, 8), (13, 8), (13, 26), (14, 17), (14, 3), (14, 1), (14, 20), (15, 11), (15, 17), (15, 5), (16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 18), (17, 14), (17, 15), (18, 16), (18, 20), (18, 25), (19, 27), (20, 14), (20, 21), (20, 7), (20, 18), (21, 23), (21, 20), (21, 4), (22, 27), (22, 6), (23, 8), (23, 5), (23, 21), (23, 10), (23, 24), (24, 0), (24, 23), (24, 28), (24, 9), (24, 3), (25, 26), (25, 18), (26, 13), (26, 10), (26, 25), (26, 3), (27, 22), (27, 28), (27, 1), (27, 19), (28, 27), (28, 24), (29, 2), (29, 5), (29, 10)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

In total, there are 17 3-stars in this graph, so the final number to be put inside brackets is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 14, 27)>, <3, (14, 26, 24)>, <5, (0, 23, 29)>, <8, (13, 9, 23)>, <9, (2, 8, 19)>, <10, (2, 23, 29)>, <13, (6, 8, 26)>, <14, (1, 17, 20)>, <16, (0, 11, 18)>, <18, (16, 20, 25)>, <20, (14, 18, 21)>, <21, (4, 20, 23)>, <23, (8, 10, 24)>, <24, (3, 9, 28)>, <26, (3, 13, 25)>, <27, (1, 19, 22)>, <29, (2, 5, 10)>
