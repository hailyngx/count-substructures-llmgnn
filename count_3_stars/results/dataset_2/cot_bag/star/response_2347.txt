Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 8, 3, and 0. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 5 neighbors it has. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. The unique 3-stars are <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 7, there are also 10 3-stars like <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.

For node 8, there are 10 3-stars like <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.

For node 3, there are 10 3-stars such as <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 0, there are 1 3-star, which is <0, (1, 5, 8)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 41 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [41].
