Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (with neighbors 9, 2, 3, 1)
- Node 1 (with neighbors 6, 8, 0, 2)
- Node 2 (with neighbors 4, 6, 9, 0, 1)
- Node 3 (with neighbors 4, 7, 9, 5, 0)
- Node 4 (with neighbors 7, 8, 9, 5, 3, 2)
- Node 5 (with neighbors 4, 6, 8, 3)
- Node 6 (with neighbors 5, 1, 2)
- Node 8 (with neighbors 4, 5, 1)
- Node 9 (with neighbors 4, 2, 3, 0)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 1: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 2: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 3: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 4: C(6,3) = 20
- Node 5: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 6: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 8: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 9: C(4,3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
