Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with 5 neighbors
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors
- Node 7 with 3 neighbors
- Node 8 with 3 neighbors
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors
- Node 13 with 4 neighbors
- Node 15 with 3 neighbors
- Node 16 with 4 neighbors
- Node 17 with 3 neighbors
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors
- Node 19 with 3 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 7: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 10: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 11: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 13: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 15: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 16: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 17: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 18: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 19: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<0, (6, 7, 18)>
<0, (13, 16, 19)>
<0, (1, 7, 16)>
<0, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (0, 7, 19)>
<4, (1, 13, 16)>
<6, (0, 7, 18)>
<13, (1, 19, 16)>
<16, (0, 1, 7)>
