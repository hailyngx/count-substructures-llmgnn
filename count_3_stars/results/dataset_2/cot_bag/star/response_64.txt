Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (1, 16) (5, 10) (5, 14) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 16) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 19) (13, 3) (13, 18) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 15, 19, 2, 12, 9, 14, 3, 18, 8, 16.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we find:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<4, (6, 7, 14)>, <10, (5, 6, 11)>, <11, (10, 12, 15)>, <15, (8, 11, 19)>, <15, (2, 15, 19)>, <15, (8, 15, 19)>, <15, (2, 19, 15)>, <19, (9, 13, 19)>, <19, (7, 15, 19)>, <19, (9, 15, 19)>, <19, (7, 19, 15)>, <2, (2, 3, 15)>, <12, (0, 9, 12)>, <9, (2, 9, 12)>, <9, (9, 14, 19)>, <9, (2, 12, 9)>, <3, (6, 13, 18)>, <3, (2, 13, 16)>, <3, (13, 16, 18)>, <3, (6, 18, 3)>, <18, (8, 13, 16)>, <18, (0, 13, 18)>, <18, (8, 16, 18)>, <18, (0, 18, 16)>, <8, (15, 17, 8)>, <16, (1, 16, 18)>, <16, (1, 17, 16)>, <16, (3, 16, 18)>, <16, (1, 18, 16)>.
