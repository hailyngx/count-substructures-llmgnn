Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (5, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({7 \choose 3} = 35\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 14: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 108

So, there are a total of [108] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 12)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 12, 4)>, 
<6, (9, 14, 7)>, 
<7, (6, 11, 14)> 

Any questions or shall I proceed with something else?
