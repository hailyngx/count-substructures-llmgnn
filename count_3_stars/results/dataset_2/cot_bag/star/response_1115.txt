Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 17) (20, 1) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 29) (23, 7) (23, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 0) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (7, 18) (7, 23) (7, 0) (3, 23) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 2) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 29) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 2) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 4) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 28) (12, 19) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 14) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 15) (15, 9) (29, 25) (29, 11) (29, 26) (29, 21) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 11, 16, 17, 19, 26, and 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by node 11.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by node 16.
Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed by node 17.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by node 19.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by node 26.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed by node 28.

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \) 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (14, 5, 29)>
<16, (13, 2, 28)>
<17, (9, 5, 13)>
<19, (12, 13, 0)>
<26, (12, 29, 25)>
<28, (12, 1, 16)>
