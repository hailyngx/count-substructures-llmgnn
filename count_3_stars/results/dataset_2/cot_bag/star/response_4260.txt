Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Here is the list of the edges provided:

(5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) 
(3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) 
(8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
(2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
(7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8)

Let's proceed to calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can be part of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can be part of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can also be part of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 45 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [45].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
