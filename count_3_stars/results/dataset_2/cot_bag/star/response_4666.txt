- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 5
- Node 25: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 3

Identifying nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29

Performing the calculation for each eligible node:

- Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 1: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 2: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 5: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 6: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 10: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 14: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 15: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 16: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 17: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 18: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 20: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 21: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 23: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 24: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 27: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 28: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 29: C(3,3) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, there are [51] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, 5, 16>
<1, 5, 27>
<2, 10, 21>
<5, 17, 24>
<6, 10, 24>
<6, 19, 27>
<6, 21, 24>
<10, 12, 26>
<14, 11, 18>
<15, 0, 8>
<16, 0, 12>
<16, 6, 20>
<18, 11, 23>
<20, 2, 29>
<21, 8, 10>
<23, 12, 24>
<24, 1, 6>
<24, 17, 5>
