Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 1 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star  
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star  
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars  
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars  
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 78 \)  

Thus, there are 78 3-stars in this graph.  
Listing the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (7, 15, 5)>, <0, (7, 15, 1)>, <0, (7, 15, 3)>, <0, (1, 11, 2)>, <1, (11, 2, 8)>, <1, (11, 2, 18)>, <1, (11, 14, 6)>, <2, (18, 6, 13)>, <2, (18, 6, 3)>, <2, (18, 6, 14)>, <2, (18, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 11, 2)>, <3, (1, 11, 0)>, <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (6, 14, 11)>, <5, (12, 7, 0)>, <6, (14, 11, 1)>, <6, (14, 11, 2)>, <7, (0, 15, 5)>, <9, (3, 6, 14)>, <9, (3, 6, 18)>, <9, (3, 6, 13)>, <9, (3, 6, 19)>, <9, (6, 18, 2)>, <9, (6, 18, 15)>, <9, (6, 18, 2)>, <9, (6, 18, 15)>, <9, (6, 18, 15)>, <9, (6, 18, 15)>
