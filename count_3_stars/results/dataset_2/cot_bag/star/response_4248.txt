Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (9, 8, 12)>
<2, (5, 12, 11)>
<3, (4, 6, 10)>
<4, (5, 12, 0)>
<5, (2, 12, 5)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<7, (12, 14, 10)>
<8, (13, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
<10, (7, 14, 3)>
<11, (2, 12, 14)>
<12, (13, 4, 7)>
<13, (8, 1, 14)>
<14, (7, 10, 13)>
