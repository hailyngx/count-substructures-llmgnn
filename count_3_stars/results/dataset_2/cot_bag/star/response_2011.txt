Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 3) (4, 27) (4, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 0) (26, 18) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 24) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 5) (19, 26) (19, 10) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 7) (6, 22) (6, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 9) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 9) (29, 14) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 5) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 12) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (17, 28) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 27) (5, 7) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 14) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 10) (24, 21) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
This graph has the following node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 2

The nodes with degrees 3 or more are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now we can count the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- For nodes with degree 3: \(1\) 3-star each
- For nodes with degree 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars each
- For nodes with degree 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars each

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\[ [1 + 4\cdot 7 + 10\cdot 2] = [1 + 28 + 20] = [49] \]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>, <1, (0, 2, 26)>, <2, (1, 14, 24)>, <3, (4, 14, 22)>, <5, (7, 23, 27)>, <6, (21, 22, 28)>, <7, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (11, 16, 29)>, <10, (0, 12, 19)>, <12, (0, 10, 22)>, <13, (7, 14, 26)>, <14, (2, 3, 24)>, <15, (8, 16, 13)>, <16, (9, 15, 28)>, <18, (22, 26, 16)>, <21, (6, 27, 24)>, <22, (18, 12, 26)>, <23, (5, 7, 14)>, <24, (21, 2, 14)>, <26, (18, 1, 13)>, <27, (21, 5, 3)>, <28, (16, 5, 14)>, <29, (9, 11, 14)>
