Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

0: 6, 7, 5, 3  
1: 3, 2, 5, 8  
2: 9, 7, 1  
3: 4, 7, 1, 0  
4: 9, 7, 5, 3  
5: 4, 7, 1, 8, 0  
6: 9, 8, 0  
7: 4, 0, 3, 2, 5  
8: 6, 9, 1, 5  
9: 6, 8, 4, 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.  
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (6, 7, 3)>  
<1, (3, 2, 5)>  
<5, (4, 7, 1)>  
<6, (9, 8, 0)>  
<7, (4, 0, 3)>  
<7, (2, 1, 5)>  
<8, (6, 9, 1)>  
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
