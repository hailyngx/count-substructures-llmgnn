Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>

<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
