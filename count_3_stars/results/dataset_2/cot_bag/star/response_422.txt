Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes by applying the combinatorial calculation  \( \binom{n}{3} \) :

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Adding all the 3-star counts together gives the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].  

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 12, 13)>  
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>  
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>  
- <1, (4, 10, 11)>  
- <1, (4, 11, 7)>  
- <2, (0, 5, 14)>  
- <2, (3, 7, 10)>  
- <2, (5, 7, 14)>  
- <2, (7, 10, 14)>  
- <2, (7, 8, 14)>  
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>  
- <4, (1, 9, 11)>  
- <5, (1, 2, 13)>  
- <5, (2, 7, 14)>  
- <7, (4, 8, 14)>
