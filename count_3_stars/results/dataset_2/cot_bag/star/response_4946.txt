Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (1, 19) (1, 18) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 19) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 5, 8, 16, 17, 14, 19, 0, 4, 18, and 1.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <6, (9, 14, 16)>, <6, (9, 14, 17)>, <6, (9, 16, 17)>, <6, (14, 16, 17)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <9, (6, 4, 5)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (8, 4, 12)>, <5, (8, 4, 10)>, <5, (8, 12, 18)>, <5, (4, 10, 12)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (5, 0, 3)>, <8, (5, 0, 7)>, <8, (5, 3, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 12)>, <8, (0, 3, 16)>, <8, (0, 7, 16)>, <8, (3, 7, 19)>, <8, (3, 7, 18)>, <8, (3, 7, 19)>, <8, (7, 10, 18)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <16, (6, 0, 14)>, <16, (6, 0, 17)>, <16, (6, 14, 17)>, <16, (0, 14, 17)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <17, (6, 13, 16)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <14, (6, 11, 16)>, <14, (6, 11, 18)>, <14, (6, 11, 18)>, <14, (11, 18, 18)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <19, (2, 1, 3)>

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <0, (8, 13, 16)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (9, 5, 10)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <18, (5, 1, 12)>, <18, (5, 1, 14)>, <18, (5, 12, 14)>, <18, (1, 12, 14)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <1, (19, 7, 18)>

Adding all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 35 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].
