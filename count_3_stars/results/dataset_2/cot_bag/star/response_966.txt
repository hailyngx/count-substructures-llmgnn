Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5  
Node 1: 2, 3, 5  
Node 2: 1, 6, 8, 9  
Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 0, 5, 7  
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8  
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9  
Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 9  
Node 9: 2, 6, 7, 8  

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 3:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 9:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 32.

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (1, 3, 8)>  
<3, (0, 5, 7)>  
<5, (0, 1, 7)>  
<7, (3, 5, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 5)>  
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
