Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: 9, 7, 2, 8
2: 6, 7, 1, 0
3: 5, 6
4: 5, 9, 7, 0
5: 9, 6, 4, 3
6: 5, 7, 3, 2, 8
7: 6, 4, 1, 0, 2
8: 9, 1, 6, 0
9: 5, 8, 4, 1

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
