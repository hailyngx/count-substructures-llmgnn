Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 16) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 5) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 16) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (4, 6) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 15}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 11, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {19}
- Node 8: {12, 15}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 16, 17}
- Node 10: {0, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 12, 16, 11}
- Node 14: {12, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 16: {5, 9, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 18: {3, 10, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 14}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula mentioned earlier and find the unique 3-stars:    

Total number of 3-stars = [ inom{8}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} ] = [ 56 + 1 + 4 + 4 ] = [ 65 ]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 12, 13)>
<1, (2, 5, 15)>
<3, (0, 5, 11)>
<12, (0, 8, 13)>
