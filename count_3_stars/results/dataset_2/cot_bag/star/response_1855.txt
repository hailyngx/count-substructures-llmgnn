Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, 2, 0, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 5, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 0, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 1, 3, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 1, 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 9, 3)>.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 1)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
