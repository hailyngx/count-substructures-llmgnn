Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Degree = 3
- Node 1: Degree = 5
- Node 2: Degree = 4
- Node 3: Degree = 6
- Node 4: Degree = 2
- Node 5: Degree = 4
- Node 6: Degree = 4
- Node 7: Degree = 5
- Node 8: Degree = 3
- Node 9: Degree = 5
- Node 10: Degree = 4
- Node 11: Degree = 4
- Node 12: Degree = 4
- Node 13: Degree = 2
- Node 14: Degree = 3

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 do not have 3 or more neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

For the other nodes:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 55 3-stars. So, the final number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<1, (3, 11, 12)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<1, (7, 12, 14)>
<3, (0, 7, 12)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 11)>
<3, (6, 7, 11)>
<5, (12, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 10, 14)>
<9, (5, 10, 7)>
<9, (5, 10, 12)>
