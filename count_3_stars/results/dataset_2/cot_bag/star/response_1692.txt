Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 13) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 1) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (18, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 10) (5, 1) (12, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: neighbors {4, 8, 10, 19} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 1: neighbors {5, 11, 16} (3 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 1
Node 2: neighbors {10, 17} (2 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 0
Node 3: neighbors {5, 9, 15} (3 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 1
Node 4: neighbors {0, 8, 16} (3 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 1
Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 10, 14} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 7: neighbors {8, 15, 18, 19} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 8: neighbors {0, 4, 7, 13} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 9: neighbors {3, 6, 13, 17} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 10: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 11: neighbors {1, 19} (2 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 0
Node 13: neighbors {8, 9, 17} (3 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 1
Node 14: neighbors {5, 19} (2 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 0
Node 15: neighbors {3, 7} (2 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 0
Node 16: neighbors {1, 4, 17} (3 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = 1
Node 17: neighbors {2, 9, 13, 16} (4 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 19: neighbors {0, 7, 11, 12, 14} (5 neighbors) - Total 3-stars = [5 choose 3] = 10

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 27, which we represent as [27].
