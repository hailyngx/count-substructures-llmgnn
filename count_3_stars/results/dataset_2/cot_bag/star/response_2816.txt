Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

From the list of edges given, we can construct the following graph with the provided information:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12)
```

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {0, 9, 11, 6}
- Node 14: neighbors {3, 11, 13}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 92 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 92, which can be represented as [92].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 14)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 9, 13)>
- <8, (5, 9, 13)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 13)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 8, 13)>
- <12, (0, 9, 11)>
- <12, (9, 11, 14)>
