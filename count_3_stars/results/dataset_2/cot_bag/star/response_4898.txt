Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 nodes (5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 10, 11, 14) with at least three neighbors, which we'll examine for 3-stars.
    
For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 3, 10)>, <5, (9, 3, 14)>, <5, (3, 10, 14)>  

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 4, 2)>  

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 7)>  

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (4, 11, 1)>  

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 10, 14)>  

For node 10:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <10, (5, 3, 11)>  

For node 11:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <11, (7, 10, 13)>  

For node 14:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <14, (5, 3, 8)>, <14, (5, 8, 12)>, <14, (5, 2, 13)>, <14, (3, 8, 12)>, <14, (3, 2, 13)>, <14, (8, 12, 13)>  

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 64  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64].
