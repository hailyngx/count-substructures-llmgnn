- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 18, and 13.
- Node 2 is not connected to any other node.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 20, 9, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 23, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 26, 19, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 17.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 28, and 26.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 18 and 21.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 5, and 8.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 14, and 5.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 16, 15, 22, 26, and 12.

- Node 21 is connected to nodes 29, 10, 25, and 24.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 18, 14, and 25.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 28 and 5.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 27, 21, and 20.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 22, 29, 21.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 6, 18, 8, 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 24 and 20.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 16, 8, 23.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 0, 25, 21.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph and present the unique 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars is $[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} ] =[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 ] = 43$.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (3, 9, 29)>   
<1, (15, 18, 13)>    
<3, (0, 9, 12)>   
<4, (3, 13, 18)>   
<5, (11, 23, 12)>   
<6, (26, 19, 17)>   
<8, (11, 28, 16)>   
<9, (3, 12, 0)>   
<10, (18, 21, 25)>   
<11, (5, 8, 16)>   
<14, (15, 22, 26)>   
<16, (11, 15, 14)>   
<18, (22, 25, 29)>   
<20, (3, 24, 27)>   
<21, (10, 24, 25)>   
<22, (14, 25, 29)>   
<26, (14, 18, 8)>   
<27, (20, 24, 21)>   
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 43.
