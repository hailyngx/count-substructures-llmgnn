Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 12) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (6, 2) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 24) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 21) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 21) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 23) (7, 18) (16, 22) (16, 14) (4, 23) (12, 26) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 0) (22, 17) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (8, 26) (8, 27) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 0) (28, 10) (28, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 13) (0, 19) (0, 8) (0, 21) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 0) (13, 1) (13, 24) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 7) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 27, 3, 22, 8, 29, 25, 7, 10, 18, 24, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 56 \)

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[9, 26, 25], [9, 26, 27], [9, 26, 8], [9, 26, 12], [9, 2, 1], [9, 2, 6], [9, 2, 11], [9, 2, 7], [9, 7, 10], [26, 12, 8], [26, 8, 27], [26, 8, 3], [26, 8, 28], [27, 15, 29], [27, 15, 18], [27, 15, 21], [27, 15, 18], [27, 18, 11], [27, 18, 7], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 13], [3, 1, 24], [3, 11, 22], [3, 11, 18], [3, 11, 2], [3, 14, 16], [10, 7, 23], [22, 17, 23], [22, 17, 11], [22, 11, 2], [22, 11, 18], [22, 11, 20], [22, 11, 16], [22, 19, 0], [8, 26, 12], [8, 26, 27], [8, 26, 3], [8, 26, 28], [8, 0, 19], [8, 0, 21], [8, 0, 17], [8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 11], [8, 3, 14], [8, 28, 10], [29, 15, 27], [29, 15, 21], [7, 9, 10], [7, 9, 23], [7, 9, 18], [7, 18, 15], [7, 23, 17], [14, 3, 1], [14, 3, 16], [14, 3, 24], [14, 16, 22], [2, 9, 26], [2, 9, 1], [2, 9, 6], [2, 11, 3], [2, 11, 18], [2, 11, 22], [24, 3, 1], [24, 3, 13], [24, 3, 20], [24, 13, 1], [0, 8, 26], [0, 8, 27], [0, 8, 3], [0, 8, 28], [0, 8, 17], [0, 19, 10], [0, 19, 22], [0, 21, 29], [0, 21, 25], [21, 29, 15], [21, 29, 20], [21, 29, 25], [21, 29, 0], [21, 25, 26], [21, 25, 29]>
       
Finally, the total number of 3-stars is [56].
