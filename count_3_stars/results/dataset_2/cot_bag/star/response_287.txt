Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 1, 14)>
<5, (9, 7, 12)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (1, 8, 14)>
<5, (1, 12, 14)>
<5, (8, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 14)>
<5, (9, 1, 12)>

Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 11, 13)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 13)>
<9, (5, 1, 14)>
<9, (11, 7, 13)>
<9, (11, 5, 7)>
<9, (11, 3, 13)>
<9, (3, 7, 13)>
<9, (5, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 1, 8)>

Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<7, (4, 11, 6)>
<7, (4, 11, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 14)>
<7, (4, 1, 14)>
<7, (4, 1, 12)>
<7, (4, 11, 12)>
<7, (11, 10, 14)>
<7, (11, 10, 12)>
<7, (11, 10, 6)>
<7, (11, 10, 1)>
<7, (10, 0, 14)>
<7, (10, 0, 12)>
<7, (10, 0, 6)>
<7, (10, 0, 1)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<7, (10, 6, 14)>
<7, (10, 6, 12)>
<7, (10, 1, 14)>

Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<14, (5, 11, 0)>
<14, (5, 12, 6)>
<14, (5, 0, 12)>
<14, (11, 12, 6)>
<14, (11, 0, 6)>
<14, (11, 0, 10)>
<14, (12, 10, 6)>
<14, (12, 0, 6)>
<14, (12, 0, 10)>
<14, (0, 10, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [10 + 10 + 20 + 10] = [50] \]
