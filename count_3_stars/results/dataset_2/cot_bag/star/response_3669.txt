Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 11) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 8) (22, 7) (22, 12) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 7) (20, 0) (20, 6) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 2) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 29) (8, 12) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 21) (17, 7) (21, 17) (21, 19) (28, 9) (4, 26) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (5, 27) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (3, 10) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 18) (6, 20) (6, 14) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 12) (19, 21) (19, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 24) (12, 2) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 6) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 4) (29, 11) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 15, 20, 24, 18
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 25, 11, 12
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 26, 27, 18, 29
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 22, 23, 17, 24
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 27, 23, 14, 29, 12
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 17, 3, 13
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 22, 8, 24, 2
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 23, 8, 1, 6
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 27, 0, 25
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 10, 21, 7
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 19, 16
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 21, 18
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors: 7, 12
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 7
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 0, 12, 7, 24
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 15, 29, 2
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 9, 1, 11
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 15, 4, 5
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 25, 8, 4, 11

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (15, 20, 24)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (9, 11, 25)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (26, 27, 29)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (22, 23, 24)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (27, 23, 29)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (1, 17, 13)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (22, 8, 24)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (23, 8, 6)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (0, 4, 19)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star: <24, (0, 12, 7)>
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (15, 29, 2)>
- Node 26, Node 27, and Node 29 each form 1 3-star uniquely by themselves.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 12 3-stars in total: [12].
