Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 26) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 24) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 22) (4, 25) (4, 29) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 21) (26, 11) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 4) (12, 2) (21, 26) (21, 25) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (5, 0) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 3) (17, 1) (17, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 10) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 0) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 12) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 13) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 14) (3, 28) (3, 13) (3, 24) (3, 20) (22, 4) (22, 11) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 10) (24, 23) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 10) (14, 8) (14, 27) (14, 24) (15, 28) (15, 0) (15, 11) (18, 27) (20, 6) (20, 3) (20, 10) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 22) (11, 15) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 20) 

Response:
There are four nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 23, and 26. So, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. For node 1: There are 4 neighbors of node 1, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
     - 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 16, 23)>, <1, (2, 17, 23)>, <1, (16, 17, 23)>, <1, (16, 0, 23)>

2. For node 4: There are 5 neighbors of node 4, giving us \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
     - 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (12, 22, 25)>, <4, (12, 2, 25)>, <4, (12, 22, 29)>, <4, (12, 2, 29)>, <4, (22, 25, 29)>, <4, (2, 25, 29)>, <4, (12, 22, 27)>, <4, (12, 2, 27)>, <4, (22, 25, 27)>, <4, (2, 25, 27)>

3. For node 23: There are 4 neighbors of node 23, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
     - 3-stars with node 23 as the center: <23, (2, 16, 24)>, <23, (1, 16, 24)>, <23, (1, 2, 24)>, <23, (1, 2, 16)>

4. For node 26: There are 4 neighbors of node 26, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
     - 3-stars with node 26 as the center: <26, (8, 11, 21)>, <26, (8, 11, 25)>, <26, (8, 21, 25)>, <26, (11, 21, 25)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
