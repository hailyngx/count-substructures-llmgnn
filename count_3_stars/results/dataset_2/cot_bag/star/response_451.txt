Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (2, 12) (2, 5) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 28 nodes in this graph as based on the given edges. In a 3-star graph, we are interested in nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Let's find those nodes and the 3-stars centered at each of them.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 100 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [100].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (8, 9, 14)>
- <3, (8, 11, 14)>
- <4, (7, 10, 12)>
- <5, (2, 10, 11)>
- <6, (1, 3, 11)>
- <7, (1, 4, 12)>
- <8, (1, 3, 14)>
- <10, (4, 5, 14)>
- <11, (0, 3, 14)>
- <12, (2, 4, 10)>
- <13, (5, 6, 13)>
- <14, (1, 3, 10)>
