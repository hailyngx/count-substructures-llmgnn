Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 68, which can be represented as [68].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 14)>
<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<1, (3, 11, 7)>
<1, (3, 12, 13)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 13)>
<3, (1, 7, 11)>
<3, (1, 12, 13)>
<3, (7, 11, 13)>
<3, (12, 8, 13)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (2, 4, 14)>
<11, (7, 6, 0)>
<13, (3, 8, 10)>
