Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first analyze each node to see how many neighbors it has.

Node 0: Neighbors (8, 11, 7, 12, 6, 9) - Total 6 neighbors
Node 1: Neighbors (8, 2, 9) - Total 3 neighbors
Node 2: Neighbors (10, 3, 14, 1, 4) - Total 5 neighbors
Node 3: Neighbors (7, 6, 4, 2) - Total 4 neighbors
Node 4: Neighbors (11, 3, 2) - Total 3 neighbors
Node 5: Neighbors (7, 14) - Total 2 neighbors
Node 6: Neighbors (3, 0, 12) - Total 3 neighbors
Node 7: Neighbors (8, 3, 0, 9, 5) - Total 5 neighbors
Node 8: Neighbors (13, 0, 12, 1, 7) - Total 5 neighbors
Node 9: Neighbors (0, 7, 14, 1, 12) - Total 5 neighbors
Node 10: Neighbors (13, 11, 2) - Total 3 neighbors
Node 11: Neighbors (10, 4, 0, 14) - Total 4 neighbors
Node 12: Neighbors (8, 0, 14, 9, 6) - Total 5 neighbors
Node 13: Neighbors (8, 10) - Total 2 neighbors
Node 14: Neighbors (11, 9, 12, 2, 5) - Total 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 88 3-stars. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [88]. 

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (8, 12, 9)>
<2, (10, 3, 14)>
<3, (7, 6, 0)>
<7, (8, 0, 9)>
<8, (13, 0, 12)>
<9, (0, 7, 14)>
<11, (10, 4, 0)>
<12, (8, 0, 14)>
<14, (11, 9, 12)>
