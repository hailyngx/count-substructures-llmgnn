Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with the total number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding these up gives a total of 41 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 12, 18)>, <3, (1, 12, 16)>, <4, (7, 13, 15)>, <5, (9, 14, 15)>, <6, (11, 17, 6)>, <9, (5, 10, 18)>, <10, (0, 13, 9)>, <11, (3, 6, 14)>, <12, (1, 2, 3)>, <13, (4, 10, 18)>, <14, (5, 11, 19)>, <15, (4, 5, 14)>, <17, (6, 19, 17)>, <18, (2, 13, 9)>, <19, (8, 14, 17)>.
