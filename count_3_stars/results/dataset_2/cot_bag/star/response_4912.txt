Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 4
- Node 1: 3, 2, 10, 18, 8
- Node 2: 17, 1, 11, 19
- Node 3: 1, 15, 10, 8
- Node 4: 19, 16, 0
- Node 5: 9, 13, 0, 7
- Node 6: 10, 16
- Node 7: 5, 14
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 5, 18, 17
- Node 10: 1, 3, 11, 6
- Node 11: 14, 10, 2
- Node 12: 15, 19
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 11, 7, 15
- Node 15: 14, 3, 12
- Node 16: 4, 6
- Node 17: 9, 19, 2
- Node 18: 9, 1, 19
- Node 19: 17, 18, 2, 4, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9, Node 10, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 42 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 10, 18)>
<1, (3, 10, 8)>
<1, (2, 10, 11)>
<1, (2, 11, 14)>
<1, (10, 11, 14)>
<2, (17, 19, 4)>
<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 16)>
<5, (7, 14, 11)>
<5, (0, 4, 19)>
<9, (18, 17, 19)>
<10, (3, 8, 1)>
<14, (7, 5, 9)>
<15, (12, 19, 4)>
<17, (19, 2, 18)>
