Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19. These nodes form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes, we find:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors: inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 0 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars gives: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 14> <0, 5, 17> <0, 5, 18> <0, 14, 17> <0, 14, 18> <1, 9, 10> <2, 5, 8> <4, 9, 2> <4, 9, 12> <4, 9, 11> <4, 9, 15> <5, 6, 7> <5, 6, 13> <7, 16, 19> <8, 2, 19> <11, 4, 8> <13, 5, 10> <16, 7, 1> <16, 7, 18>
