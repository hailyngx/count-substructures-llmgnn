Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 5 neighbors: 4, 13, and 18. Let's find the 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 4:
- \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 13:
- \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 18:
- \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 13, 5)>
<4, (12, 2, 18)>
<13, (7, 14, 0)>
<13, (7, 5, 14)>
<18, (2, 5, 6)>
<18, (2, 19, 14)>
<18, (5, 6, 1)>
<18, (5, 19, 14)>
