Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 79 \).
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (1, 10, 13)>, <11, (3, 7, 13)>
