Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (2, 29) (2, 0) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (17, 29) (17, 26) (17, 4) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 6) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 9) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 7) (7, 26) (25, 8) (15, 13) (15, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 11) (19, 15) (16, 29) (16, 27) (16, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 14) (10, 12) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 17) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 1, 21, 29, 12, 27, 8, 29, 0, 14, 17, 11, 28, 26, 3, 20, and 24.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes based on the connection of their neighbors, and then sum them up to find the total number of 3-stars.

For node 13: 
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 22, 4, 15
- Number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 

For node 22:
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 13, 28, 21
- Number of 3-stars with node 22 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 21, 20, 28
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)

For node 21:
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 22, 1, 29, 4
- Number of 3-stars with node 21 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)

For node 29:
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 21, 2, 17, 16
- Number of 3-stars with node 29 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

For the rest of the nodes, we can follow the same logic:
- 12: 4 3-stars
- 27: 4 3-stars
- 8: 4 3-stars
- 0: 1 3-star
- 14: 1 3-star
- 17: 1 3-star
- 11: 4 3-stars
- 28: 4 3-stars
- 26: 1 3-star
- 3: 1 3-star
- 20: 1 3-star
- 24: 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars gives: \(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42\)

So, there are a total of 42 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: [42]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<13, (22, 4, 15)>, <22, (13, 28, 21)>, <1, (21, 20, 28)>, <21, (22, 1, 29)>, <29, (21, 2, 17)>, <12, (5, 10, 0)>, <27, (11, 16, 8)>, <8, (27, 23, 25)>, <0, (12, 14, 2)>, <14, (0, 9, 24)>, <17, (29, 26, 4)>, <11, (27, 19, 5)>, <28, (22, 1, 10)>, <26, (17, 18, 7)>, <3, (12, 9, 6)>, <20, (1, 23, 10)>, <24, (8, 14, 24)>
