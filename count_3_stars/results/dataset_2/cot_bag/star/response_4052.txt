Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
- 0: {16, 12, 6}
- 1: {10, 18}
- 2: {4, 16}
- 3: {15, 14}
- 4: {15, 7, 10, 5, 2}
- 5: {4, 19, 14}
- 6: {15, 0, 8, 18, 12}
- 7: {15, 4, 19}
- 8: {6, 12}
- 9: {10, 11, 12}
- 10: {4, 11, 1, 9, 14}
- 11: {10, 9, 13}
- 12: {0, 8, 9, 17, 6}
- 13: {11}
- 14: {3, 10, 5}
- 15: {3, 7, 6, 4}
- 16: {0, 2}
- 17: {12}
- 18: {1, 19, 6}
- 19: {7, 5, 18}

Next, we'll identify the three or more node neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 6, 10, 12, 15, 4, 18}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final result in brackets is [36].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (16, 12, 6)>, <6, (15, 0, 8)>, <6, (15, 0, 18)>, <6, (15, 12, 8)>, <6, (15, 12, 18)>, <6, (0, 12, 8)>, <6, (0, 12, 18)>, <10, (4, 11, 1)>, <10, (4, 11, 9)>, <10, (4, 1, 9)>, <10, (4, 9, 12)>, <10, (11, 1, 9)>, <12, (6, 8, 17)>, <12, (6, 9, 17)>, <12, (6, 12, 17)>, <15, (3, 7, 6)>, <15, (3, 4, 6)>, <15, (7, 4, 6)>, <15, (4, 7, 6)>, <4, (15, 7, 19)>, <4, (15, 4, 7)>, <4, (15, 4, 5)>, <4, (7, 4, 5)>, <4, (10, 4, 5)>, <18, (1, 19, 6)>
