Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will consider each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered around that node. Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, 2. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 5, 3, 14, 4, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 13, 10, 0, 11. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 11, 7, 0, 14. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 12, 10, 14. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 8, 1, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 10, 12. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 3, 8. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 14, 0. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 6, 3, 2, 4. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 3, 2, 12. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 6, 11, 4. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 5, 2. No 3-star is formed.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 4. It forms 1 3-star.

So, in total, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 14)>
<2, (13, 10, 0)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (1, 12, 10)>
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<10, (6, 3, 2)>
<11, (3, 2, 12)>
<12, (6, 11, 4)>
<14, (9, 1, 3)>
