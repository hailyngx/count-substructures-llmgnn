Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 15) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 16) (20, 24) (26, 1) (26, 17) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 27) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (19, 18) (19, 0) (5, 10) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 24) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 21) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 8) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 28) (27, 8) (27, 21) (27, 23) (9, 21) (12, 18) (12, 24) (12, 28) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 28) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 27) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 26) (6, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 28) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from the above calculations gives us a total of [57].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 13)>, 
<0, (7, 13, 19)>, 
<0, (7, 14, 23)>, 
<0, (7, 15, 19)>, 
<0, (7, 17, 26)>, 
<7, (0, 14, 17)>, 
<7, (0, 15, 21)>, 
<15, (0, 20, 21)>, 
<16, (22, 24, 28)>, 
<17, (2, 26, 28)>, 
<18, (12, 19, 24)>, 
<20, (15, 16, 24)>, 
<21, (13, 21, 27)>, 
<22, (14, 16, 28)>, 
<24, (12, 16, 29)>, 
<25, (3, 15, 25)>, 
<28, (10, 12, 24)>.
