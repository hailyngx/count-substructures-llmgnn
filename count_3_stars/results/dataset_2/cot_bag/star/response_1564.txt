Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 13, 16, 18
- Node 1: 0, 2, 10
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 14
- Node 3: 4, 16, 19
- Node 4: 3, 8, 15
- Node 5: 11
- Node 6: 1, 2, 10
- Node 7: 2, 18
- Node 8: 4, 18
- Node 9: 11, 16, 17
- Node 10: 1, 6, 17
- Node 11: 5, 9, 13, 19
- Node 12: 19
- Node 13: 0, 11, 17
- Node 14: 2, 15, 18
- Node 15: 4, 14
- Node 16: 0, 3, 9, 17
- Node 17: 9, 10, 13, 16, 19
- Node 18: 0, 7, 8, 14
- Node 19: 11, 17, 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, there are 34 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely:
<0, 1, 13, 18>, <0, 1, 16, 18>, <0, 13, 16, 18>, <0, 1, 13, 16>, <2, 6, 10, 17>, <2, 7, 14, 18>, <3, 4, 16, 19>, <9, 11, 16, 19>, <11, 13, 17, 19>, <11, 16, 17, 19>, <13, 16, 17, 19> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
