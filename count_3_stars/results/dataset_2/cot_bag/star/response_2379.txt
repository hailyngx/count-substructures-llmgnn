Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.
From the provided data, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 5, 4, 3, 0, 7, 2, 8, 1, and 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, which means it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which means it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, which means it can form only 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 62 3-stars. So, the final answer is [62].

Here are the unique 3-stars formed in this graph:
<6, (9, 10, 12)>, <9, (6, 11, 12)>, <10, (6, 11, 12)>, <11, (9, 10, 5)>, <12, (6, 9, 10)>, <5, (10, 11, 7)>, <4, (9, 3, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 0)>, <7, (12, 5, 2)>, <2, (7, 13, 4)>, <8, (9, 12, 1)>, <1, (7, 8, 13)>, <14, (6, 4, 3)>.
