Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (0, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 16, 17, and 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding up the total: \( 9 \times 4 + 3 = 39 \) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [39].

Unique 3-stars formed in the graph are: 
<2, (14, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 11)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (17, 2, 19)>
<10, (12, 16, 0)>
<11, (14, 4, 13)>
<12, (5, 16, 13)>
<13, (12, 11, 9)>
<14, (11, 16, 17)>
<16, (14, 10, 18)>
<17, (6, 5, 8)>
<18, (16, 13, 3)>
