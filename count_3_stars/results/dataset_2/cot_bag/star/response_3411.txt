Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 3, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 74

So, the final answer is [74].
Checking through the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 8, 11)>, <7, (8, 11, 14)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (1, 8, 14)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 8, 11)>, <3, (1, 8, 14)>, <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (8, 11, 14)>, 
<9, (11, 13, 14)>, <9, (1, 13, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 13)>

The total number of unique 3-stars found is 20.
