Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 3
- Node 1: 7, 3, 2
- Node 2: 6, 4, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9, 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 4, 3, 7
- Node 6: 7, 2, 4, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, 1
- Node 8: 4, 2
- Node 9: 5, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from all nodes, we get: 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 32 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32], which can be represented uniquely as:
<5, (3, 9, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>.
