Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
<9, (6, 7, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 0)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
