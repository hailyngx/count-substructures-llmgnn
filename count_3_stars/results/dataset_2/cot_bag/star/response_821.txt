Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors (5, 3)
- Node 1: Neighbors (7, 3, 6)
- Node 2: Neighbors (5, 8, 6)
- Node 3: Neighbors (5, 4, 1, 0, 8)
- Node 4: Neighbors (9, 3, 6)
- Node 5: Neighbors (9, 2, 8, 0, 3, 7)
- Node 6: Neighbors (4, 7, 1, 2, 8)
- Node 7: Neighbors (5, 9, 6, 1)
- Node 8: Neighbors (5, 9, 3, 2, 6)
- Node 9: Neighbors (5, 8, 4, 7)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (5, 4, 1)>
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (7, 1, 2)>
- <8, (9, 3, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
