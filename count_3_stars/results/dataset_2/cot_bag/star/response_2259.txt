Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 4, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 13, 2, 11, 4, and 10.
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the central node.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 7, 8, 13, and 1.
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 7, 3, 6, 11, and 10.
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 10 + 20] = 50 \).

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
