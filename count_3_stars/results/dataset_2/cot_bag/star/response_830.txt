Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 11) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 27) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 15) (26, 12) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 2) (9, 21) (22, 19) (22, 9) (22, 16) (22, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 15) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 27) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (21, 9) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 24) (25, 14) (25, 2) (11, 4) (11, 21) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (13, 20) (13, 27) (15, 26) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 20) (3, 10) (24, 14) (24, 21) (23, 4) (23, 18) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 0) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 27) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 8) (27, 5) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 8) (0, 22) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 14, 17, 5, 6, 28, 29, 19, 26, 9, 22, 18, 20, 3, 21, 25, 11, 2, 13, 15, 12, 27, 1, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45].
