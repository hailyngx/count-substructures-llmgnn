Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: {16, 7, 10}
2: {14}
3: {11, 5}
4: {8, 0, 6}
5: {16, 3, 14}
6: {4, 10, 14, 19}
7: {12, 1, 19}
8: {4, 14, 15}
9: {0, 15, 18}
10: {1, 17, 6, 19}
11: {16, 3, 15}
12: {7, 17, 18}
13: {19}
14: {8, 2, 5, 6}
15: {11, 8, 9}
16: {11, 1, 5}
17: {10, 12, 18}
18: {17, 12, 9}
19: {7, 13, 10, 0, 6}

Now we can analyze which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we get: $[7]$

Unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 10, 16)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 14, 16)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<7, (1, 10, 19)>
<8, (4, 14, 15)>
<10, (1, 6, 19)>
