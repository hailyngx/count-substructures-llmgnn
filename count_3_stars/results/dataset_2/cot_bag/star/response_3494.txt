Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are two nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 5 and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 4.
   - Total number of 3-stars with node 5 as the central node: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <5, (9, 18, 4)>

2. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 7, and 12.
   - Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars:
     - <9, (5, 0, 7)>
     - <9, (5, 0, 12)>
     - <9, (5, 7, 12)>
     - <9, (0, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 = 5, which can be represented as [5].
