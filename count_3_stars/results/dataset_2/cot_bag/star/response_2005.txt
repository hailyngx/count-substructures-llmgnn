Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. 

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors.

We will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 20 + 20] = [50] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- <6, (9, 7, 8)>
- <6, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (7, 2, 8)>
- <7, (6, 1, 3)>
- <7, (6, 1, 4)>
- <7, (6, 3, 4)>
- <7, (6, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (6, 9, 3)>
- <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- <8, (6, 3, 4)>
- <8, (6, 3, 5)>
- <8, (6, 4, 5)>
- <8, (9, 3, 4)>
- <8, (9, 3, 5)>
- <8, (9, 4, 5)>
