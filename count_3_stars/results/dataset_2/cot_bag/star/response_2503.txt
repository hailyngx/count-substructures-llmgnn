Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 82 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <4, (2, 10, 14)>
- <5, (2, 11, 13)>
- <6, (1, 10, 14)>
- <8, (0, 12, 3)>
- <10, (4, 12, 9)>
- <12, (2, 11, 5)>
- <13, (0, 6, 1)>
- <14, (0, 1, 6)>
