Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 5) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 17) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 5) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 3) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 22) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 21) (26, 2) (26, 12) (26, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (20, 21) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 22) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 9) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 3) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 27) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 12 as the center.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 15 as the center.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 17 as the center.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 18 as the center.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 19 as the center.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 21 as the center.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 22 as the center.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 25 as the center.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 26 as the center.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 27 as the center.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 29 as the center.

Adding up the 3-stars gives a total of [45].
