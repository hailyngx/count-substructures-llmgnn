Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's identify pairs of nodes that are connected by an edge:
(6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 12), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), 
(10, 2), (11, 1), (11, 13), (11, 4), (11, 2), 
(8, 13), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 0), 
(13, 11), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 3), 
(4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 8), 
(5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 14), 
(2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 8), (2, 14), 
(0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 1), 
(14, 8), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 12),
(7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 14), (7, 1),
(3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 13), (3, 5), 
(1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 7),
(12, 6), (12, 14)

Now, let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars:

Node 6: (6, 9, 5), (6, 9, 7), (6, 9, 3)          => 3
Node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 6, 3), (9, 11, 1), (9, 4, 11), (9, 4, 8) => 5
Node 13: (13, 11, 8), (13, 11, 4), (13, 8, 4), (13, 8, 5)    => 4
Node 8: (8, 13, 4), (8, 13, 11), (8, 4, 11), (8, 14, 0), (8, 14, 2) => 5
Node 14: (14, 8, 5), (14, 8, 2), (14, 8, 0), (14, 7, 1), (14, 12, 6) => 5
Node 5: (5, 13, 3), (5, 13, 11), (5, 13, 1), (5, 6, 1)        => 4
Node 2: (2, 10, 11), (2, 10, 8), (2, 11, 8), (2, 14, 0)       => 4

Sum of 3-stars = 3 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, 9, 5>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 3>,
<9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 3>, <9, 11, 1>, <9, 4, 11>, <9, 4, 8>,
<13, 11, 8>, <13, 11, 4>, <13, 8, 4>, <13, 8, 5>,
<8, 13, 4>, <8, 13, 11>, <8, 4, 11>, <8, 14, 0>, <8, 14, 2>,
<14, 8, 5>, <14, 8, 2>, <14, 8, 0>, <14, 7, 1>, <14, 12, 6>,
<5, 13, 3>, <5, 13, 11>, <5, 13, 1>, <5, 6, 1>,
<2, 10, 11>, <2, 10, 8>, <2, 11, 8>, <2, 14, 0>
