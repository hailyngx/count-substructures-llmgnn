Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 6 neighbors (9, 6, 1, 7, 0, 4)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (5, 9, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (9, 2, 8, 4, 7)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (5, 6, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 4, 2, 3)

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3:  6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 4:  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5:  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8:  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 9:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in the given graph.
