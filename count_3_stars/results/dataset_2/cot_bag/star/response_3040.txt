Response:
The nodes with \( \geq 3 \) neighbors are:
- Node 1: neighbors 21, 29, 9
- Node 2: neighbors 22, 4, 6, 28
- Node 3: neighbors 13, 5
- Node 7: neighbors 21, 29, 19, 28
- Node 10: neighbors 21, 22, 15, 27
- Node 11: neighbors 16, 15, 20
- Node 12: neighbors 29, 24, 18
- Node 13: neighbors 3, 15, 18
- Node 14: neighbors 21, 6, 9
- Node 15: neighbors 11, 22, 10, 13
- Node 16: neighbors 11, 24, 6
- Node 18: neighbors 23, 12, 25, 13
- Node 20: neighbors 11, 27, 5
- Node 21: neighbors 1, 7, 10, 14
- Node 22: neighbors 2, 5, 10, 15
- Node 24: neighbors 16, 12, 25
- Node 27: neighbors 29, 20, 10, 28
- Node 28: neighbors 7, 2, 27, 19
- Node 29: neighbors 1, 7, 17, 27

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 28)>, <7, (21, 19, 28)>, <10, (22, 15, 27)>, <11, (15, 20, 16)>, <18, (23, 25, 13)>, <22, (2, 15, 10)>, <27, (29, 10, 20)>, <28, (19, 2, 7)>
