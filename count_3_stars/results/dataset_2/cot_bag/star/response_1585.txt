Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation for the total number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars:

Node 0:  Degree=5
Node 1:  Degree=5
Node 2:  Degree=5
Node 3:  Degree=4
Node 4:  Degree=4
Node 5:  Degree=4
Node 6:  Degree=2
Node 7:  Degree=4
Node 8:  Degree=3
Node 9:  Degree=5
 
Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 have at least 3 neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
 
For node 0:  C(5, 3) = 10
For node 1:  C(5, 3) = 10
For node 2:  C(5, 3) = 10
For node 5:  C(4, 3) = 4
 
Summing up, we have a total of [10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [34] 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 2, 5>
<1, 0, 2, 5>
<2, 0, 1, 5>
<5, 0, 1, 2>
