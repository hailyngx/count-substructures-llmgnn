Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (26, 16) (26, 27) (5, 19) (5, 16) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 4) (18, 22) (18, 29) (18, 3) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 8) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 21) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 3) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 23) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 24) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 11) (15, 20) (15, 4) (7, 14) (7, 0) (19, 5) (11, 20) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 12) (16, 26) (16, 5) (16, 6) (21, 2) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 10) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 20) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 18) (3, 29) (6, 29) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 25) (24, 27) (24, 1) (24, 25) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes. Let's find the 3-stars and count them.

1. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 22, 28, 10
2. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 17, 7, 4, 2, 28
   Total 3-stars formed by node 14 = inom{5}{3} = 10
3. Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 14, 28, 23, 2, 4
   Total 3-stars formed by node 17 = inom{5}{3} = 10
4. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 22, 29, 3
5. Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 0, 15, 8, 28, 11
   Total 3-stars formed by node 20 = inom{5}{3} = 10
6. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 9, 18, 27, 8
7. Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 26, 22, 12, 24
8. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 18, 1, 6, 3
9. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 29, 11, 24, 13
10. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 29, 11, 16, 25
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 20, 1, 6, 25
12. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 27, 25, 23
13. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 26, 5, 6
14. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 12, 11, 6, 24

Total number of 3-stars formed = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (22, 28, 10)>, <14, (17, 7, 4)>, <17, (14, 23, 2)>, <20, (0, 15, 8)>, <20, (0, 15, 11)>, <20, (0, 8, 28)>, <20, (15, 8, 28)>, <20, (15, 11, 28)>, <22, (9, 18, 27)>, <27, (26, 12, 24)>, <29, (18, 6, 3)>, <1, (29, 11, 24)>, <6, (29, 11, 25)>
