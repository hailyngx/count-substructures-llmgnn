Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 6), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 3), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors
Node 1: has 3 neighbors
Node 2: has 5 neighbors
Node 3: has 4 neighbors
Node 4: has 5 neighbors
Node 5: has 4 neighbors
Node 6: has 4 neighbors
Node 7: has 5 neighbors
Node 8: has 5 neighbors
Node 9: has 1 neighbor [No 3-star formed with this node]

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 57

Answer: [57]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 0, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 7, 2)>
<8, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (8, 4, 6)>
<8, (8, 4, 2)>
<8, (8, 3, 6)>
<8, (8, 2, 6)>
