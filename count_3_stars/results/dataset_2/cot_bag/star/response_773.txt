Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 24) (17, 14) (17, 10) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 19) (27, 8) (20, 9) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 26) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 3) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 2) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 25) (26, 22) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 14) (18, 24) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 27) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 8) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 22) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 7) (8, 24) (24, 14) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 23) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 13) (23, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives 66 in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [66].
