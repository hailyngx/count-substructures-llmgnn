Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

1. Node 0: 
   - has neighbors 4, 9, 13, 14
   - Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars: <0, (4, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 9, 14)>, <0, (4, 13, 14)>, <0, (9, 13, 14)>

2. Node 1: 
   - has neighbors 4, 2, 3, 11, 14
   - Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
