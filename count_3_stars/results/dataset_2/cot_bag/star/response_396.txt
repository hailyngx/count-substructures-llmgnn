Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
We see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors   => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: 5 neighbors   => inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: 4 neighbors   => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: 4 neighbors   => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: 4 neighbors   => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: 7 neighbors   => inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 7: 4 neighbors   => inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: 5 neighbors   => inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 75 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [75].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 8, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
