Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 3) (15, 13) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 14) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 2) (21, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 18) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 10) (26, 28) (26, 16) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 10) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 29) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (24, 27) (24, 16) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (11, 7) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 14) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 4) (17, 2) (25, 6) (25, 5) (25, 14) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 3) (20, 6) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 27, 7, 16, 17
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 21, 4, 17, 10
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 28, 13, 17, 2
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 5, 25, 19, 20
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 27, 22, 12, 29, 25
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 13, 9
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 0, 26, 24
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 22, 26, 4, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 28: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (16, 7, 17)>, <2, (4, 17, 10)>, <4, (28, 13, 17)>, <6, (19, 20, 9)>, <14, (27, 22, 25)>, <15, (9, 13, 3)>, <16, (0, 24, 26)>, <28, (22, 4, 10)>.
