Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 5: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 7 neighbors
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 93 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [93], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 3, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 2)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
