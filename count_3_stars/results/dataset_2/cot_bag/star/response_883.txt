The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 12) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 19) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 4) (4, 22) (4, 27) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 11) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (13, 11) (13, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (20, 11) (20, 10) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 5) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (1, 28) (1, 15) (1, 25) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 16) (6, 24) (6, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 20) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 8) (3, 27) (3, 29) (25, 21) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (0, 25) (0, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 10) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 23) (23, 9) (23, 21) (23, 20) (23, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (26, 21, 23)
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors (9, 12)
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors (11, 24)
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors (22, 16, 12)
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors (18, 4)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (22, 27)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (8, 20, 11)
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors (9, 28, 23, 25, 29)
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (21, 12, 1)
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors (2, 23, 11)
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors (4, 3, 5)
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (16, 1, 7, 5)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (18, 15, 7, 10)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (28, 15, 25)
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors (14, 6, 19)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (13, 15, 16)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (24, 29)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (14, 2, 13, 20)
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors (21, 6, 25, 3)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (8, 27, 29)
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors (21, 1, 29, 0)
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (20, 16, 5)
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (25, 12)
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors (17, 24)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (27, 15, 10)
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors (26, 18, 28, 0, 23)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors (9, 21, 20, 12)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 9: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 15: [4]
- Node 16: [4]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 11: [6]
- Node 29: [6]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 25: [6]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 12: [10]
- Node 23: [4]

Adding the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 54

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in the given graph.

List of unique 3-stars found: 
<9, (26, 21, 23)>, <18, (22, 16, 12)>, <2, (8, 20, 11)>, <21, (9, 28, 23)>, <28, (21, 12, 1)>, <20, (2, 23, 11)>, <27, (4, 3, 5)>, <15, (16, 1, 7)>, <16, (18, 15, 7)>, <1, (28, 15, 25)>, <24, (14, 6, 19)>, <7, (13, 15, 16)>, <11, (14, 2, 13)>, <29, (21, 6, 25)>, <3, (8, 27, 29)>, <25, (21, 1, 29)>, <10, (20, 16, 5)>, <5, (27, 15, 10)>, <12, (26, 18, 28)>, <23, (9, 21, 20)>
