Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 18) (16, 18) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 18) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, and 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 40 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
