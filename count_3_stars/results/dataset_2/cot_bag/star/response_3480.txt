Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 29) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 3) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 18) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 2) (10, 18) (21, 12) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 16) (3, 26) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 20) (7, 13) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 24) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 23) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 23) (22, 5) (22, 12) (27, 9) (27, 17) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 15) (12, 21) (12, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 25) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node: 
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 67 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 20>
<1, 2, 8>
<9, 6, 20>
<11, 0, 26>
<14, 8, 24>
<15, 18, 28>
<16, 14, 28>
<17, 20, 27>
<19, 11, 23>
<23, 19, 29>
<25, 15, 28>
