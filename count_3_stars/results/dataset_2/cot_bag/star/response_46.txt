Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 3, 0, 14, 13, 7, 11, 8, 6, 2, 12, and 10. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 60 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<9, (5, 11, 1)>
<1, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 4)>
<0, (14, 13, 4)>
<14, (0, 11, 4)>
<13, (5, 7, 2)>
<7, (9, 13, 7)>
<11, (9, 8, 12)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 14, 10)>
<12, (1, 11, 2)>
<10, (5, 3, 4)>
