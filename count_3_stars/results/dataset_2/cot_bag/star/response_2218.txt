Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Hence, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 2, 18)>, <2, (0, 7, 10)>, <3, (11, 17, 18)>, <4, (7, 9, 15)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <10, (9, 16, 18)>, 
<11, (3, 13, 17)>, <14, (5, 6, 19)>, <15, (4, 16, 17)>, <16, (8, 10, 15)>, <17, (3, 15, 18)>, <18, (0, 10, 17)>
