Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 14) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (9, 0) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 4) (13, 16) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 3, node 4, node 5, node 7, and node 15. 

For node 3:
There are 3 edges connected to node 3, forming 1 3-star: <3, (15, 12, 8)>

For node 4:
There are 4 edges connected to node 4, forming 4 3-stars: <4, (7, 19, 16)>, <4, (7, 13, 16)>, <4, (19, 7, 14)>, <4, (16, 17, 13)>

For node 5:
There are 4 edges connected to node 5, forming 2 3-stars: <5, (10, 2, 11)>, <5, (2, 12, 11)>

For node 7:
There are 3 edges connected to node 7, forming 1 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 19)>

For node 15:
There are 5 edges connected to node 15, forming 10 3-stars: <15, (3, 12, 8)>, <15, (3, 1, 2)>, <15, (3, 16, 8)>, <15, (1, 17, 16)>, <15, (2, 18, 16)>, <15, (2, 5, 18)>, <15, (18, 16, 13)>, <15, (16, 4, 17)>, <15, (16, 17, 16)>, <15, (16, 17, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 10] = 18.
