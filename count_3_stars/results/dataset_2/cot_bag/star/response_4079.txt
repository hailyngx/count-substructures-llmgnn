Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (17, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (19, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [8, 9, 0, 3, 15]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [11, 17, 7, 2]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [4, 16, 15, 1]
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [10, 4, 3]
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: [10, 1, 18, 6, 12]
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [11, 1, 13]
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: [12, 14, 7]
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: [10, 13, 3]
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: [4, 8, 18]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4:
   - \([\binom{5}{3}] = 10\)
   - The 3-stars are: 
     - <4, (8, 0, 3)>, 
     - <4, (8, 0, 15)>, 
     - <4, (8, 3, 15)>, 
     - <4, (0, 3, 15)>, 
     - <4, (8, 9, 3)>, 
     - <4, (8, 9, 0)>, 
     - <4, (8, 9, 15)>, 
     - <4, (9, 0, 3)>, 
     - <4, (9, 0, 15)>, 
     - <4, (9, 3, 15)>

2. Node 6:
   - \([\binom{4}{3}] = 4\)
   - The 3-stars are:
     - <6, (11, 17, 7)>, 
     - <6, (11, 17, 2)>, 
     - <6, (11, 7, 2)>, 
     - <6, (17, 7, 2)>

3. Node 8:
   - \([\binom{4}{3}] = 4\)
   - The 3-stars are:
     - <8, (4, 16, 15)>, 
     - <8, (4, 16, 1)>, 
     - <8, (4, 15, 1)>, 
     - <8, (16, 15, 1)>

4. Node 9:
   - \([\binom{4}{3}] = 4\)
   - The 3-stars are:
     - <9, (10, 4, 3)>, 
     - <9, (10, 4, 9)>, 
     - <9, (10, 3, 9)>, 
     - <9, (4, 3, 9)>

5. Node 11:
   - \([\binom{5}{3}] = 10\)
   - The 3-stars are:
     - <11, (10, 1, 18)>, 
     - <11, (10, 1, 6)>, 
     - <11, (10, 1, 12)>, 
     - <11, (10, 18, 6)>, 
     - <11, (10, 18, 12)>, 
     - <11, (10, 6, 12)>, 
     - <11, (1, 18, 6)>, 
     - <11, (1, 18, 12)>, 
     - <11, (1, 6, 12)>, 
     - <11, (18, 6, 12)>

6. Node 15:
   - \([\binom{3}{3}] = 1\)
   - The 3-star is: 
     - <15, (4, 8, 18)>

For nodes 12, 13, and 14, since they have exactly 3 neighbors, they each form only 1 3-star:
- Node 12: <12, (11, 1, 13)>
- Node 13: <13, (12, 14, 7)>
- Node 14: <14, (10, 13, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 34\).

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <6, (11, 17, 7)>, <8, (4, 16, 15)>, <9, (10, 4, 3)>, <11, (10, 1, 18)>, <15, (4, 8, 18)>, <12, (11, 1, 13)>, <13, (12, 14, 7)>, <14, (10, 13, 3)>.
