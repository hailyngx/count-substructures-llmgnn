Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (26, 20) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 7) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 24) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 16) (12, 27) (12, 29) (6, 5) (6, 11) (19, 15) (19, 21) (19, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 7) (28, 25) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 20) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 21) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 4) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 28) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 16) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 2) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 25) 

Response:
Given the graph information you provided, let's determine the number of 3-stars it contains:

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 18, 17, and 10.
Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 15, 12, 24, and 2.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 29, and 8.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 13, and 16.
Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 22, 17, 25, and 16.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1, 12, and 21.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 27, 3, 0, and 4.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, and 18.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 27, 19, and 7.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 26, 19, and 10.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 8, 4, and 7.
Node 22 has 2 neighbors: 23 and 0.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 15, 21, and 20.
Node 21 has 2 neighbors: 19 and 29.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 14, and 25.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 15, 13, and 28.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 8, 23, 4, and 2.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 23, 28, 18, and 2.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 27, 0, 16, and 25.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 22, 10, 24, and 2.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, and 20.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 11.
Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 27 and 29.
Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 14.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 11 and 18.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 17, and 24.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 13, 24, and 16.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, and 23.
Node 26 has 1 neighbor: 20.
Node 28 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 25.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total} = \binom{12}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 220. \]

Putting the final count inside brackets: [220].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:

<27, 15, 12>
<27, 15, 24>
