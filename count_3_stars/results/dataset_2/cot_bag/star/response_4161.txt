Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<Node 1, (9, 4, 12)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (4, 11, 8)>, <1, (12, 11, 14)>, <1, (9, 12, 14)>, <1, (9, 4, 11)>, <1, (9, 12, 8)>, <1, (4, 12, 8)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<Node 4, (7, 10, 1)>, <4, (7, 10, 13)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (10, 12, 1)>

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<Node 5, (6, 4, 11)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 3, 11)>, <5, (4, 3, 11)>

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<Node 7, (4, 10, 0)>, <7, (4, 1, 11)>, <7, (4, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 11, 14)>

Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
<Node 9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 3, 14)>, <9, (6, 5, 12)>, <9, (6, 1, 12)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 1, 8)>, <9, (2, 13, 0)>, <9, (13, 0, 10)>, <9, (13, 0, 7)>, <9, (0, 10, 12)>, <9, (0, 10, 14)>, <9, (0, 7, 14)>, <9, (10, 14, 12)>, <9, (10, 7, 12)>, <9, (10, 7, 14)>, <9, (12, 14, 1)>, <9, (12, 11, 14)>, <9, (12, 1, 11)>, <9, (12, 1, 8)>, <9, (12, 10, 14)>, <9, (14, 11, 1)>, <9, (14, 11, 10)>, <9, (14, 1, 8)>, <9, (14, 10, 8)>, <9, (11, 1, 8)>, <9, (11, 10, 14)>, <9, (11, 4, 12)>, <9, (4, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>, <9, (4, 12, 8)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (1, 12, 8)>, <9, (1, 11, 8)>

Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<Node 10, (7, 4, 12)>, <10, (7, 4, 14)>, <10, (7, 4, 1)>, <10, (7, 1, 11)>, <10, (7, 1, 8)>, <10, (7, 11, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 1)>, <10, (4, 11, 14)>, <10, (4, 11, 8)>, <10, (12, 14, 1)>, <10, (12, 1, 8)>, <10, (12, 11, 14)>, <10, (1, 11, 14)>, <10, (1, 11, 8)>, <10, (1, 14, 8)>, <10, (11, 14, 8)>, <10, (11, 4, 12)>, <10, (1, 8, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 11)>

Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<Node 11, (7, 5, 14)>, <11, (7, 5, 1)>, <11, (7, 14, 10)>, <11, (7, 14, 1)>, <11, (7, 10, 1)>, <11, (5, 1, 14)>, <11, (5, 14, 3)>, <11, (5, 3, 4)>, <11, (5, 3, 14)>, <11, (5, 4, 14)>, <11, (14, 10, 1)>, <11, (14, 10, 8)>, <11, (14, 1, 8)>, <11, (14, 4, 10)>, <11, (14, 4, 1)>, <11, (14, 8, 1)>, <11, (10, 1, 8)>, <11, (10, 4, 1)>, <11, (10, 4, 14)>, <11, (1, 4, 14)>

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<Node 12, (9, 10, 14)>, <12, (9, 10, 1)>, <12, (10, 1, 14)>, <12, (10, 14, 1)>

Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<Node 13, (0, 2, 4)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 102 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [102].
