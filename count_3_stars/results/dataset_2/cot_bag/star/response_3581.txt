Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 76 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [76], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
