Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 8) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 16) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (12, 15) (12, 18) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 14) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 neighbors each: nodes 3, 0, 15, 8, 14, 5, 18, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<3, (0, 15, 19)>

2. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (3, 15, 8)>, <0, (3, 10, 8)>, <0, (3, 8, 19)>, <0, (15, 10, 8)>

3. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<15, (3, 0, 12)>, <15, (3, 5, 12)>, <15, (0, 10, 12)>, <15, (0, 5, 12)>

4. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (0, 17, 19)>, <8, (17, 2, 18)>, <8, (17, 2, 19)>, <8, (17, 18, 12)>

5. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (3, 9, 16)>, <14, (3, 4, 16)>, <14, (9, 4, 6)>, <14, (9, 16, 6)>

6. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (3, 2, 18)>, <5, (3, 18, 12)>, <5, (3, 18, 7)>, <5, (2, 18, 7)>

7. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<18, (17, 5, 12)>, <18, (8, 5, 12)>, <18, (8, 5, 7)>, <18, (8, 7, 12)>

8. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<13, (11, 17, 6)>, <13, (11, 6, 7)>, <13, (17, 6, 7)>, <13, (17, 8, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29.

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
