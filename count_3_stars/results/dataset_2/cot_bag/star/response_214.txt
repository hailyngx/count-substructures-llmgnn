Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 0) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 8) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 9) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 7, 13, 15, and 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 13: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 15: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 16: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 3-stars. 

Therefore, there are 23 3-stars in this graph. Represented uniquely, they are <5, (4, 12, 15)>, <5, (12, 13, 15)>, <5, (13, 15, 1)>, <5, (13, 15, 0)>, <7, (4, 17, 19)>, <13, (0, 5, 12)>, <13, (0, 5, 15)>, <13, (0, 5, 15)>, <13, (3, 12, 15)>, <15, (0, 5, 13)>, <15, (1, 5, 16)>, <15, (1, 13, 5)>, <15, (1, 13, 0)>, <16, (1, 6, 10)>, <16, (1, 6, 8)>, <16, (1, 10, 8)>, <16, (6, 8, 10)>, <16, (14, 1, 6)>, <16, (14, 1, 10)>, <16, (14, 1, 8)>, <16, (14, 6, 8)>, <16, (6, 8, 10)> and <16, (10, 14, 19)>.
