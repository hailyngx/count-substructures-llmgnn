Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 15) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 0) (17, 19) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (8, 3) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

We see that node 6 has 5 neighbors, node 9 has 3 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 10 has 3 neighbors, node 11 has 3 neighbors, node 0 has 3 neighbors, node 12 has 4 neighbors, node 5 has 4 neighbors, node 19 has 4 neighbors, node 16 has 4 neighbors, node 4 has 4 neighbors, node 15 has 4 neighbors, node 13 has 3 neighbors, node 17 has 2 neighbors, and node 18 has 1 neighbor.

We can now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34\). So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (1, 10, 12)>, <6, (1, 10, 16)>, <6, (1, 16, 12)>, <6, (10, 16, 12)>, <12, (4, 15, 19)>, <5, (4, 15, 19)>, <19, (0, 17, 14)>, <16, (2, 13, 7)>.
