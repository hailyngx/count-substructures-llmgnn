Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 10 has 2 neighbors.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
Node 13 has 2 neighbors.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors.

So, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

[inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + inom{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + inom{5}{3} + 1 + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3}]

[4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4]

[36]

So, there are 36 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 17)>
<4, (1, 6, 12)>
<5, (1, 2, 19)>
<6, (1, 5, 11)>
<8, (0, 12, 14)>
<10, (12, 15, 17)>
<12, (4, 10, 18)>
<13, (0, 17, 19)>
<15, (10, 12, 17)>
<17, (2, 5, 19)>
