Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 74 \) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [74].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars that are formed:
- <0, (9, 10, 0)>
- <3, (11, 3, 14)>
- <7, (5, 7, 14)>
- <7, (7, 1, 8)>
- <7, (7, 9, 0)>
- <7, (7, 9, 2)>
- <7, (7, 9, 3)>
- <7, (7, 9, 11)>
- <9, (0, 9, 13)>
- <9, (3, 9, 11)>
- <9, (3, 9, 13)>
- <9, (7, 9, 0)>
- <9, (7, 9, 2)>
- <9, (7, 9, 3)>
- <9, (7, 9, 11)>
- <12, (10, 12, 6)>
- <13, (1, 13, 8)>
