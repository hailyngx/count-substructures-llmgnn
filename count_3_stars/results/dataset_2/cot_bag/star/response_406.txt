Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 9, 10, and 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 10, and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 10, and 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 10, 11, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 13.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in this graph. 
1. Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
2. Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
3. Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
4. Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
5. Node 11 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
6. Node 14 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10] = 68.

The unique 3-stars found are:
