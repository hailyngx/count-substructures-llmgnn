Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = [56] \]

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>


This graph contains a total of 56 3-stars, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
