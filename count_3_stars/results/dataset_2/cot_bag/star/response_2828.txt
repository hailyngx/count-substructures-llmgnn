Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
There are total 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and 14.

For node 4:
With 4 neighbors (7, 12, 1, 6), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<4, (7, 12, 1)>, <4, (7, 12, 6)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (12, 1, 6)>

For node 7:
With 4 neighbors (4, 10, 14, 13), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<7, (4, 10, 14)>, <7, (4, 10, 13)>, <7, (4, 14, 13)>, <7, (10, 14, 13)>

For node 1:
With 3 neighbors (4, 3, 2), there is only 1 3-star.
<1, (4, 3, 2)>

For node 3:
With 5 neighbors (1, 11, 14, 6, 5), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 11, 6)>, <3, (1, 11, 5)>, <3, (1, 14, 6)>, <3, (1, 14, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <3, (11, 14, 6)>, <3, (11, 14, 5)>, <3, (11, 6, 5)>, <3, (14, 6, 5)>

For node 8:
With 4 neighbors (9, 5, 0, 12), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<8, (9, 5, 0)>, <8, (9, 5, 12)>, <8, (9, 0, 12)>, <8, (5, 0, 12)>

For node 14:
With 5 neighbors (7, 3, 11, 6, 9), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<14, (7, 3, 11)>, <14, (7, 3, 6)>, <14, (7, 3, 9)>, <14, (7, 11, 6)>, <14, (7, 11, 9)>, <14, (7, 6, 9)>, <14, (3, 11, 6)>, <14, (3, 11, 9)>, <14, (3, 6, 9)>, <14, (11, 6, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
