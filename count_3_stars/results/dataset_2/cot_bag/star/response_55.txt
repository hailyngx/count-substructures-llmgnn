Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 3, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 10, 11, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 0, 13, 2, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 10, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 13, 2, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 14, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 11, 8, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 13, 14, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 14, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 4, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 14, 7, 13, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {13, 7, 4, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 3, 11, 8, 5, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 9, 11, 8, 12}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- With 0 3-stars,
- With 1 3-star: Node 4 forms the 3-star <4, (6, 10, 12)>
- With 2 3-stars: Node 7 forms the 3-stars <7, (10, 11, 8)> and <7, (11, 13, 12)>
- With 3 3-stars: Node 13 forms the 3-stars <13, (1, 3, 5)>, <13, (1, 5, 8)>, and <13, (3, 11, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 2 + 3] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (6, 10, 12)>, <7, (10, 11, 8)>, <7, (11, 13, 12)>, <13, (1, 3, 5)>, <13, (1, 5, 8)>, <13, (3, 11, 12)>.
