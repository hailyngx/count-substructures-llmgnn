Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
To start, we need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have at least three neighbors each. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Since node 0 is the common central node for all these 3-stars, we only count it once. 
The unique 3-stars involving node 0 are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 2: 
There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Since node 2 is the common central node for all these 3-stars, we only count it once. 
The unique 3-stars involving node 2 are: 
<2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 4:
There are 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). Since node 4 is the common central node for all these 3-stars, we only count it once. 
The unique 3-stars involving node 4 are: 
<4, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (6, 9, 2)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (6, 2, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 2, 8)>, <4, (7, 2, 8)>.

For nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
Since each of these nodes has exactly 4 neighbors, only one unique 3-star is formed with each of these nodes. 
The unique 3-stars involving these nodes are:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the nodes:

4 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) + 20 (from node 4) + 5 (from nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 39

Therefore, we have a total of [39] 3-stars in the given graph.
