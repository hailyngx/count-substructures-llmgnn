Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (13, 17) (4, 6) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 19) (11, 2) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 3) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (10, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (8, 5, 17), forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors (8, 3, 11, 16), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors (9, 2, 8, 19), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors (14, 15, 0, 16), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors (2, 0, 12, 3, 1), forms 10 3-stars
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors (8, 4, 18, 1), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors (17, 18, 15, 5), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 16: has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 18, 15), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 17: has 4 neighbors (6, 14, 13, 0), forms 4 3-stars
- Node 19: has 3 neighbors (1, 11, 3), forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].
