Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0, 14, and 11.

For node 6:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 14, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 14)>, <6, (1, 14, 3)>.

For node 9:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars: <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 11, 1)>, <9, (6, 12, 1)>, <9, (6, 4, 11)>, <9, (6, 4, 12)>, <9, (6, 11, 12)>, <9, (4, 11, 1)>, <9, (4, 12, 1)>, <9, (11, 12, 1)>, <9, (4, 11, 12)>.

For node 4:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 13)>, <4, (9, 11, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 11)>, <4, (9, 13, 3)>, <4, (9, 13, 11)>, <4, (7, 13, 3)>, <4, (7, 11, 3)>, <4, (7, 11, 13)>, <4, (13, 11, 3)>, <4, (7, 13, 11)>.

For node 7:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars: <7, (4, 3, 10)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>, <7, (3, 10, 5)>, <7, (8, 5, 10)>.

For node 3:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars: <3, (6, 4, 10)>, <3, (6, 7, 0)>, <3, (6, 14, 10)>, <3, (6, 0, 10)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 10, 0)>, <3, (7, 14, 10)>, <3, (7, 0, 10)>, <3, (14, 0, 10)>, <3, (7, 14, 0)>.

For node 2:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars: <2, (8, 1, 11)>, <2, (8, 11, 0)>, <2, (8, 1, 14)>, <2, (8, 0, 14)>, <2, (1, 11, 0)>, <2, (1, 11, 14)>, <2, (1, 0, 14)>, <2, (11, 0, 14)>, <2, (1, 11, 0)>, <2, (1, 11, 14)>.

For node 0:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars: <0, (13, 2, 11)>, <0, (13, 3, 11)>, <0, (13, 11, 14)>, <0, (2, 3, 11)>.

For node 14:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars: <14, (6, 2, 10)>, <14, (6, 2, 3)>, <14, (2, 10, 3)>, <14, (6, 10, 3)>.

For node 11:
There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars: <11, (9, 4, 0)>, <11, (9, 4, 12)>, <11, (9, 8, 2)>, <11, (9, 2, 0)>, <11, (9, 2, 12)>, <11, (9, 0, 12)>, <11, (4, 8, 0)>, <11, (4, 8, 2)>, <11, (4, 8, 12)>, <11, (4, 8, 13)>, <11, (4, 2, 0)>, <11, (4, 2, 12)>, <11, (4, 0, 12)>, <11, (4, 0, 13)>, <11, (8, 2, 0)>, <11, (8, 2, 12)>, <11, (8, 0, 12)>, <11, (8, 0, 13)>, <11, (2, 0, 12)>, <11, (2, 0, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is given by \(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 76\). So, the final answer is [76].
