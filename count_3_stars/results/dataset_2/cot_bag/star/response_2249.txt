Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and the edges are as given. Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 4.
Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 2, 7.
Node 2: Connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, 3, 7.
Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 2.
Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 0, 3.
Node 5: Connected to nodes 8, 1, 4, 0.
Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 7, 3, 8, 0.
Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 1.
Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 2, 1.
Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 0.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 53 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].
