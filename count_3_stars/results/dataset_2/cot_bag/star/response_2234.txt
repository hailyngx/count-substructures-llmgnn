Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [8]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 11, 14)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 13)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 9, 11)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
