Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (4, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 7, 13, 5, 8, 16, 9, 18, 15, and 6.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 7, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (1, 0, 12)>
<7, (3, 0, 6)>
<13, (5, 11, 14)>
<5, (8, 13, 16)>
<8, (5, 12, 14)>
<16, (1, 0, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 18)>
<18, (11, 6, 14)>
<15, (6, 17, 19)>
<6, (7, 15, 18)>
