Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node to see if it has three or more neighbors. For each such node, we can calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in.

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 10, 12
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 10, 13
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 14
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 9, 11
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 11
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 10
Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 12
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 12, 14
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 4, 11

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 can form [C(6, 3)] = 20 3-stars
Node 1 can form [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars
Node 2 can form [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars
Node 3 can form [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars
Node 5 can form [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars
Node 10 can form [C(6, 3)] = 20 3-stars
Node 12 can form [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 84 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 10>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 4, 14>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 11>, <1, 4, 12>, <2, 3, 10>, <2, 6, 11>, <5, 6, 11>, <9, 10, 12>
