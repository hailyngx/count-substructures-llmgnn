Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70

So, the final answer is [70].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
