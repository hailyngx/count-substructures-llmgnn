Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to create the graph representation based on the given nodes and edges. Let's format the information in a clearer way:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- 1: 5, 3, 6, 14, 13, 4
- 2: 11, 7, 10, 14
- 3: 9, 1, 11, 7, 8
- 4: 1, 11, 12
- 5: 9, 8, 1, 10
- 6: 1, 11, 12
- 7: 3, 11, 2
- 8: 5, 3, 0
- 9: 5, 11, 10, 3, 0
- 10: 5, 9, 2, 14
- 11: 9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 2
- 12: 6, 0, 4, 14
- 13: 1, 14, 0
- 14: 1, 13, 12, 10

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula.

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes, we get a total of 75 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [75], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 13>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 5, 10>
<1, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 6, 11>
<1, 6, 12>
<1, 13, 14>
<2, 10, 14>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 10>
<3, 7, 11>
<4, 6, 12>
<9, 10, 14>
<11, 2, 7>
