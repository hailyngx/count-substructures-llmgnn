Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 5) (0, 8) (0, 28) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 21) (21, 2) (21, 14) (21, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 1) (22, 15) (22, 9) (22, 5) (24, 15) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 7) (7, 8) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 19) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 23) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 23) (18, 14) (18, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (4, 23) (4, 6) (11, 21) (11, 7) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 6) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 20) (5, 22) (5, 18) (23, 10) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 28) (12, 19) (16, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be summarized as follows:

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Edges:
(2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 21) (29, 25) (29, 14) 
(3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 13) (8, 0) 
(8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15 ,22) (15, 24) 
(20, 1) (20, 5) (0, 28) (14, 18) (14, 21) 
(21, 11) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) 
(9, 1) (22, 5) (24, 17) (26, 7) (7, 11)
(7, 19) (10, 23) (27, 23) (18, 5) (19, 12) 
(4, 6) (11, 21) (6, 17) (6, 16) (1, 20) 
(1, 19) (23, 4) (12, 28)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.
