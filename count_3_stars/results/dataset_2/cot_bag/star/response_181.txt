Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- There are three nodes with exactly three neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5. So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each of these nodes.
- There are two nodes with more than three neighbors: nodes 2 and 4. We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for node 2 and \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for node 4.

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
