Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 8) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 15) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 2) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 8) (18, 10) (8, 17) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {15}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 16, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {19, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {13, 12, 19}
- Node 5: {9, 1, 10, 16, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {10, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {17, 15, 6, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 17, 18, 7}
- Node 11: {9, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 4}
- Node 13: {4, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 15: {0, 19, 8, 16}
- Node 16: {5, 15, 2}
- Node 17: {10, 1, 8}
- Node 18: {10}
- Node 19: {15, 4, 3}

By counting the number of neighbors for each node, we see that only nodes 1, 5, 10, and 15 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars now:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 22 possible 3-stars. So, the final answer is [22].

Unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 12)>, 
<5, (1, 10, 16)>,  
<10, (5, 17, 18)>,  
<15, (0, 8, 16)>
