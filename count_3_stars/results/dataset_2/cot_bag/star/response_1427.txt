Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below for clarity:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 20 = 55 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
