Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 6) (5, 17) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 12) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 9) (12, 19) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that each have 3 or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 19, 0, 15 (4 neighbors)
Node 16 has neighbors: 13, 4, 6 (3 neighbors)
Node 6 has neighbors: 16, 9, 4 (3 neighbors)
Node 14 has neighbors: 17, 8, 19, 4, 15 (5 neighbors)
Node 17 has neighbors: 5, 14, 13 (3 neighbors)
Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 2, 12 (3 neighbors)
Node 15 has neighbors: 11, 1, 14 (3 neighbors)
Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 14, 2, 18 (4 neighbors)
Node 10 has neighbors: 13, 7 (2 neighbors)
Node 12 has neighbors: 9, 19 (2 neighbors)
Node 0 has neighbors: 11, 19, 18 (3 neighbors)
Node 4 has neighbors: 16, 6, 3, 14 (4 neighbors)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (7, 19, 0)>, <11, (7, 19, 15)>, <11, (7, 0, 15)>, <11, (19, 0, 15)>

Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<16, (13, 4, 6)>

Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (16, 9, 4)>

Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<14, (17, 8, 19)>, <14, (17, 8, 4)>, <14, (17, 8, 15)>, <14, (17, 19, 4)>, <14, (17, 19, 15)>,
<14, (17, 4, 15)>, <14, (8, 19, 4)>, <14, (8, 19, 15)>, <14, (19, 4, 15)>, <14, (8, 4, 15)>

Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<17, (5, 14, 13)>

Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (6, 2, 12)>

Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<15, (11, 1, 14)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (3, 14, 2)>, <8, (3, 14, 18)>, <8, (3, 2, 18)>, <8, (14, 2, 18)>

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<0, (11, 19, 18)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (16, 6, 3)>, <4, (16, 6, 14)>, <4, (16, 3, 14)>, <4, (6, 3, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 27 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
