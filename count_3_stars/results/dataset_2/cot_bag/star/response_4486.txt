Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 17) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 24) (18, 27) (18, 15) (18, 12) (0, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 20) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 23) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (10, 22) (21, 15) (21, 17) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 10) (5, 2) (5, 11) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 17) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (16, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 15) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 26) (17, 16) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 6) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 13) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 6) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 12) (13, 6) (25, 26) (25, 16) (23, 28) (23, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 11: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 18: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 20: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 22: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 24: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 26: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 28: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

For node 29: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 57 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].
