Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 16) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 12) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 2) (25, 17) (25, 20) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 12) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 28) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 6) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 23) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 4) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 18) (7, 13) (29, 23) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 27) (21, 19) (3, 26) (3, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
We will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

- Node 0: Forms 3-stars with nodes 15, 5, and 20.
- Node 2: Forms 3-stars with nodes 14, 4, and 20.
- Node 4: Forms 3-stars with nodes 17, 0, and 5.
- Node 6: Forms 3-stars with nodes 17, 0, and 19.
- Node 8: Forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 15, and 28.
- Node 11: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 10, 18, and 8.
- Node 12: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 11, 16, and 23.
- Node 13: No 3-star formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 16: Forms 3-stars with nodes 27, 22, and 28.
- Node 23: Forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 5, and 29.
- Node 26: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 9, 19, and 27.
- Node 27: Forms 3-stars with nodes 26, 15, and 21.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 15, 5, 20>
<2, 14, 4, 20>
<4, 17, 0, 5>
<6, 17, 0, 19>
