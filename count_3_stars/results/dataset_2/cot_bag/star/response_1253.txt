Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 6. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where n is the number of neighbors for the node.

For node 0, there are 6 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 3, there are 5 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors (3, 7, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 4 = 34 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [34].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
