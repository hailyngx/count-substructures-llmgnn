Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [10 choose 3] = 120 ways to form a 3-star with each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: Only 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 53.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
