Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so it can form 7 choose 3 = 35 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 35 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 92

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [92].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 13)>, <1, (3, 13, 9)>, <1, (3, 13, 12)>, <1, (3, 13, 1)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 13)>, <2, (3, 13, 9)>, <2, (3, 13, 12)>, <2, (3, 13, 1)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 13)>, <3, (9, 13, 6)>, <3, (13, 9, 10)>, <4, (8, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 8, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 13)>, <9, (13, 3, 12)>, <10, (8, 0, 14)>, 
<12, (3, 13, 0)>, <13, (1, 9, 3)>, <14, (3, 11, 2)>
