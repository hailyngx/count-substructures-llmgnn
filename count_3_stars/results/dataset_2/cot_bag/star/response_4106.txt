Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 13) (6, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 15) (9, 3) (9, 2) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 18) (10, 3) (10, 8) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 15) (5, 16) (5, 17) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 8, 14, 17, 1, 3, 13, 2, 17, 15, 4, 9, 18, 19, and 0.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.

Total 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 29 \)

So, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in this graph.
