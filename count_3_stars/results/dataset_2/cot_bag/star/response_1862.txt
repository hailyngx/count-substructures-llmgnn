Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 14)>
<5, (7, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>
<13, (10, 11, 8)>
<14, (4, 13, 3)>
