Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 9) (17, 6) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 2) (10, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, and 19. Let's determine the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <6, (0, 11, 17)>
- <8, (9, 2, 18)>
- <8, (9, 8, 2)>
- <8, (9, 8, 0)>
- <8, (9, 17, 6)>
- <12, (13, 1, 19)>
- <12, (13, 12, 14)>

- <19, (12, 13, 1)>
