Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 14) (13, 2) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 6) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 19) (9, 3) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].
