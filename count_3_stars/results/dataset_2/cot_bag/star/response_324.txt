Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, first, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.  
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

Node 0:  3 neighbors <0, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 5:  2 neighbors (2 <5, 13, 0>)
Node 8:  3 neighbors <8, (0, 15, 11)>
Node 9:  3 neighbors <9, (4, 13, 7)>
Node 10: 3 neighbors <10, (6, 17, 14)>  
Node 12: 3 neighbors <12, (15, 16, 6)>  
Node 13: 3 neighbors <13, (9, 4, 5)>  
Node 14: 3 neighbors <14, (17, 19, 10)>  
Node 15: 4 neighbors <15, (1, 8, 12)>  
Node 16: 4 neighbors <16, (9, 6, 11)>  
Node 17: 3 neighbors <17, (14, 10, 19)>  
Node 19: 3 neighbors <19, (7, 14, 17)>  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
