Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9, 11, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 15, 18, and 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 10, and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 9, 17, and 18.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8 and 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 12, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to node 3.
- Node 16 is connected to node 6.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 10.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (6, 13, 15, 18, 19).
  There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
  <3, (6, 13, 15)>, <3, (6, 13, 18)>, <3, (6, 13, 19)>, <3, (6, 15, 18)>, <3, (6, 15, 19)>, <3, (6, 18, 19)>, <3, (13, 15, 18)>, <3, (13, 15, 19)>, <3, (13, 18, 19)>, <3, (15, 18, 19)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (2, 5, 17, 18).
  There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.
  <9, (2, 5, 17)>, <9, (2, 5, 18)>, <9, (2, 17, 18)>, <9, (5, 17, 18)>, <9, (2, 17, 18)>, <9, (5, 17, 18)>

Adding these up: \[ [10 + 10] = [20] \]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20.
