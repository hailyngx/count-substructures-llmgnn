Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 5 or more neighbors: 9, 10, 4, 8, 0, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 9 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
    <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 13)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 13)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 1, 13)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 13, 2)>

- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
    <10, (11, 0, 8)>, <10, (11, 0, 13)>, <10, (0, 8, 13)>, <10, (4, 8, 13)>, <10, (8, 4, 1)>, <10, (8, 4, 13)>, <10, (8, 4, 2)>, <10, (4, 1, 13)>, <10, (4, 1, 2)>, <10, (1, 13, 2)>

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
    <4, (9, 10, 8)>, <4, (9, 10, 1)>, <4, (9, 10, 13)>, <4, (9, 10, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 8, 13)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 13)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 13, 2)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    <8, (5, 9, 10)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 1, 13)>, <8, (5, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 13)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 13, 2)>, <8, (1, 13, 2)>

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
    <0, (10, 4, 14)>, <0, (10, 4, 3)>, <0, (10, 4, 7)>, <0, (10, 4, 14)>, <0, (10, 4, 3)>, <0, (10, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 14, 3)>, <0, (4, 14, 7)>, <0, (4, 3, 7)>, <0, (14, 3, 7)>

- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
    <14, (4, 12, 6)>, <14, (4, 12, 3)>, <14, (4, 12, 0)>, <14, (4, 12, 6)>, <14, (4, 12, 3)>, <14, (4, 12, 0)>, <14, (12, 6, 3)>, <14, (12, 6, 0)>, <14, (12, 3, 0)>, <14, (6, 3, 0)>

Adding these up:  
\[ [35 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20] = 105 \]

So, there are 105 total 3-stars in this graph.
