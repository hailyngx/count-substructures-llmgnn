Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 94.

Therefore, there are 94 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 13>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 11, 4>, <3, 12, 10>, <3, 2, 13>, <7, 9, 14>, <8, 11, 13>, <8, 11, 4>, <8, 12, 10>, <9, 14, 7>, <12, 10, 4>, <13, 6, 4>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [94].
