This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0:  Neighbors: 1, 3, 12, 13, 9
- Node 1:  Neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 11
- Node 2:  Neighbors: 6, 8, 13, 14
- Node 3:  Neighbors: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4:  Neighbors: 8, 13
- Node 5:  Neighbors: 3, 8, 12, 14
- Node 6:  Neighbors: 2, 10, 12
- Node 7:  Neighbors: 1, 8, 12, 13, 14
- Node 8:  Neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9:  Neighbors: 0, 8, 14
- Node 10: Neighbors: 6, 11
- Node 11: Neighbors: 1, 10, 12, 14
- Node 12: Neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13
- Node 13: Neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 12
- Node 14: Neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can find the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating based on the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 0.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 1.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 2.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there's only 1 3-star involving node 3.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 5.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 7.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 8.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving node 12.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 13.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 14.

Summing these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 83 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is given by [83].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 12, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 12, 13>, <1, 12, 9>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 13, 14>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 8, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 8, 13>, <7, 8, 14>, <7, 12, 13>, <7, 12, 14>, <7, 13, 14>, <8, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 7>, <8, 12, 14>, <8, 13, 14>, <12, 13, 7>, <12, 13, 14>
