Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 0) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 0) (7, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 14) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 6, 12)>
<12, (3, 16, 17)>
<14, (9, 18, 19)>
<15, (2, 5, 12)>
<18, (0, 8, 16)>
<19, (1, 6, 14)>
<0, (3, 4, 18)>
<2, (9, 15, 17)>
<5, (1, 13, 15)>
<6, (1, 4, 19)>
