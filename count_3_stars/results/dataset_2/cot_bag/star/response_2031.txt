Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 7, and 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (9, 2, 8)> <5, (9, 2, 4)> <5, (9, 8, 4)> <5, (2, 8, 4)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (5, 6, 8)> <9, (5, 6, 3)> <9, (5, 6, 1)> <9, (5, 8, 3)> <9, (5, 8, 1)> <9, (5, 3, 1)> <9, (6, 8, 3)> <9, (6, 8, 1)> <9, (6, 3, 1)> <9, (8, 3, 1)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <4, (5, 2, 1)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (0, 6, 2)> <7, (0, 6, 1)> <7, (0, 6, 8)> <7, (0, 2, 1)> <7, (0, 2, 8)> <7, (0, 1, 8)> <7, (6, 2, 1)> <7, (6, 2, 8)> <7, (6, 1, 8)> <7, (2, 1, 8)>

- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (5, 4, 7)> <2, (5, 4, 3)> <2, (5, 4, 6)> <2, (5, 4, 0)> <2, (5, 7, 3)> <2, (5, 7, 6)> <2, (5, 7, 0)> <2, (5, 3, 6)> <2, (5, 3, 0)> <2, (5, 6, 0)> <2, (4, 7, 3)> <2, (4, 7, 6)> <2, (4, 7, 0)> <2, (4, 3, 6)> <2, (4, 3, 0)> <2, (4, 6, 0)> <2, (7, 3, 6)> <2, (7, 3, 0)> <2, (7, 6, 0)> <2, (3, 6, 0)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars we found: 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 45, so the total number of 3-stars is [45].
