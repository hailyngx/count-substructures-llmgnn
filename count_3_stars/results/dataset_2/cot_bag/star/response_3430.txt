Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 9) (9, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, therefore it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes gives us a total of \(4+4+1+1+4+1+4+10+1+4+1+1+10 = 45 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 10, 15)>
<1, (4, 6, 11)>
<2, (10, 14, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 14)>
<5, (13, 19, 0)>
<6, (13, 4, 1)>
<10, (2, 16, 14)>
<11, (7, 1, 17)>
<13, (5, 19, 6)>
<14, (4, 2, 10)>
<15, (12, 0, 11)>
<17, (7, 16, 11)>
<19, (13, 5, 12)>
