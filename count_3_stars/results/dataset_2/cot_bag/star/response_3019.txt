Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (22, 2) (22, 16) (22, 0) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 20) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 3) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 15) (27, 21) (2, 6) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 4) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 4) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 28) (0, 22) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 17) (25, 10) (25, 26) (25, 14) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (24, 5) (24, 16) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (8, 10) (8, 28) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 24) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 7) (26, 25) (26, 29) (29, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 2, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form and then sum up the total.

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (18, 19, 28)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<10, (8, 11, 28)>
<11, (3, 10, 23)>
<13, (9, 15, 28)>
<15, (4, 15, 20)>
<16, (16, 22, 24)>
<21, (12, 21, 27)>
<22, (0, 2, 16)>
<23, (3, 11, 16)>
<25, (14, 25, 26)>
<28, (8, 13, 15)>
