Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 16) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 1) (19, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.
Let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed around these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<1, (17, 10, 12)>
<1, (17, 10, 18)>
<1, (17, 12, 18)>
<1, (10, 12, 18)>
<1, (10, 15, 18)>
<1, (12, 15, 18)>
<1, (10, 15, 12)>
<1, (10, 15, 19)>
<1, (15, 12, 19)>
<1, (10, 12, 19)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (11, 3, 9)>
<8, (11, 9, 6)>
<8, (11, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 9, 6)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (6, 0, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>

Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<10, (1, 15, 19)>

Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<11, (8, 7, 17)>

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (1, 15, 18)>
<12, (1, 15, 19)>
<12, (15, 18, 14)>
<12, (15, 14, 6)>

Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<13, (14, 18, 5)>

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (1, 13, 18)>
<14, (12, 15, 6)>
<14, (12, 15, 1)>
<14, (15, 18, 6)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<15, (12, 14, 1)>
<15, (12, 14, 18)>
<15, (12, 10, 19)>
<15, (10, 1, 19)>

Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<17, (1, 11, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [34].
