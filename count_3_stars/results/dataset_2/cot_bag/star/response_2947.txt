Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 23) (9, 19) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 23) (17, 29) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 18) (26, 16) (28, 16) (28, 24) (24, 28) (24, 20) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 27) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 11) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 27) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 13) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 16) (0, 21) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 16) (14, 11) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 27) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 5) (20, 24) (20, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 27) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 18) (18, 29) (18, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 nodes that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [35].
