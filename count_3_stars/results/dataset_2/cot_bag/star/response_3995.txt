Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 5
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4

Let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (9, 4, 0)> and <6, (7, 3, 0)>

No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 3.
Thus, the final answer is [3].
