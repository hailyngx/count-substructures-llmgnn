Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The adjacency list representation of the graph is as follows:
0: [6, 9, 3, 8]
1: [9, 4, 3, 8]
2: [9, 4, 8]
3: [7, 1, 0]
4: [9, 7, 1, 2]
5: [6, 7, 8]
6: [5, 7, 8, 0]
7: [6, 9, 4, 3, 5]
8: [6, 1, 2, 5, 0]
9: [4, 2, 1, 7, 0]

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (6, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 3, 8)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (9, 4, 3)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 8)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<8, (6, 1, 2)>, <8, (6, 1, 5)>, <8, (6, 2, 5)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 0, 5)>, <8, (5, 0, 2)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<9, (4, 7, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 3)>, <9, (4, 1, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (7, 1, 2)>, <9, (7, 1, 3)>, <9, (7, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>

In total, there are \(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 42\) 3-stars. 
Thus, the final answer is [42].
