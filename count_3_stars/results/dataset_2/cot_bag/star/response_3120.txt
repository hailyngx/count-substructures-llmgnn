Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
From the given information, the nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, we'll determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For each node, we'll check how many neighbors it has:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 102

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [102].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (8, 12, 0)>, 
<2, (7, 5, 2)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 3)>, 
<4, (8, 5, 4)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 5)>, 
<6, (11, 6, 14)>, 
<7, (10, 2, 7)>, 
<8, (13, 11, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<10, (14, 7, 10)>, 
<11, (4, 14, 11)>, 
<12, (0, 7, 12)>, 
<13, (8, 10, 13)>, 
<14, (6, 10, 14)>
