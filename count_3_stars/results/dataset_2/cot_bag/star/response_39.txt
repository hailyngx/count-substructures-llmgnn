Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the above information:

- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11:
  They each have 5 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  Total for these nodes: \( 7 \times 10 = 70 \)

- For nodes 4, 6, 13, 14:
  They each have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Total for these nodes: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 70 (from nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11) + 16 (from nodes 4, 6, 13, 14) = 86.

So, the final answer is [86].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 14)>, <0, (1, 8, 14)>, <0, (7, 8, 14)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 14)>, <1, (7, 8, 14)>, 
<2, (8, 9, 10)>, <2, (8, 9, 11)>, <2, (8, 10, 11)>, <2, (9, 10, 11)>, 
<4, (1, 14, 6)>, <4, (1, 14, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (14, 6, 9)>
