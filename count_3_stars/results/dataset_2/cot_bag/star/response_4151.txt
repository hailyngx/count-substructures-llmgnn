Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 1) (19, 11) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (16, 2) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 9) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 18) (5, 4) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (14, 18), (14, 2), (14, 5), (17, 10), (17, 15), (17, 4), (10, 17), (10, 3), (10, 12), (0, 2), (0, 13), (0, 9), (2, 14), (2, 0), (2, 16), (2, 11), (8, 1), (19, 11), (19, 7), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 13), (11, 2), (11, 19), (11, 15), (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (16, 2), (18, 14), (18, 5), (18, 15), (18, 7), (12, 10), (12, 15), (12, 9), (5, 14), (5, 1), (5, 18), (5, 4), (4, 17), (4, 5), (4, 13), (4, 6), (13, 0), (13, 3), (13, 4), (7, 19), (7, 1), (7, 18), (7, 9), (9, 0), (9, 12), (9, 7), (15, 17), (15, 11), (15, 18), (15, 12), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Next, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Total 3-stars = Î£ nodes (inom{k}{3}), where k is the number of neighbors

Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3}

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4

Total 3-stars = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Lastly, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 13, 9)>, <2, (14, 0, 16)>, <4, (17, 13, 6)>, <5, (14, 1, 18)>, <7, (19, 1, 18)>, <9, (0, 12, 7)>, <10, (17, 3, 12)>, <11, (2, 19, 15)>, <12, (10, 15, 9)>, <13, (0, 3, 4)>, <14, (18, 2, 5)>, <15, (17, 11, 18)>, <17, (10, 15, 4)>, <18, (14, 5, 7)>
