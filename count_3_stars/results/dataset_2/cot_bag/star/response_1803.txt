Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have exactly three neighbors: nodes 5, 9, and 13. Therefore, we can construct 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Calculating for node 5:  
There are 4 possible neighbors for node 5 (nodes 9, 13, 3, and 7), and we choose 3 of them to form a 3-star.  
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]  
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 5.  
The 3-stars centered at node 5 are:  
<5, (9, 13, 3)>
  
Calculating for node 9:  
There are 5 possible neighbors for node 9 (nodes 5, 2, 3, 1, and 12), and we choose 3 of them to form a 3-star.  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]  
Therefore, there are 10 3-stars centered at node 9.  
The 3-stars centered at node 9 are:  
<9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 12)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 12)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>,  
<9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 12)>, <9, (2, 1, 12)>, <9, (3, 1, 12)>
  
Calculating for node 13:  
There are 5 possible neighbors for node 13 (nodes 5, 8, 10, 14, and 7), and we choose 3 of them to form a 3-star.  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]  
Therefore, there are 10 3-stars centered at node 13.  
The 3-stars centered at node 13 are:  
<13, (5, 8, 10)>, <13, (5, 8, 14)>, <13, (5, 8, 7)>, <13, (5, 10, 14)>, <13, (5, 10, 7)>, <13, (5, 14, 7)>,  
<13, (8, 10, 14)>, <13, (8, 10, 7)>, <13, (8, 14, 7)>, <13, (10, 14, 7)>
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ [4 + 10 + 10] = 24 \]
Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in the graph.
