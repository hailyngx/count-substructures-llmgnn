Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 26) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 29) (27, 17) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 26) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 29) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 0) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 19) (14, 28) (14, 29) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 18) (9, 10) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 24) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 12) (29, 14) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) 

Response:
There are 11 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 11, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 11:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars with center node 11.

For node 15:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is only 1 3-star with center node 15.

For node 21:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 3-stars with center node 21.

For node 22:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 3-stars with center node 22.

For node 24:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is only 1 3-star with center node 24.

For node 25:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is only 1 3-star with center node 25.

For node 26:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 3-stars with center node 26.

For node 28:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is only 1 3-star with center node 28.

For node 29:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 3-stars with center node 29.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 36, which can be represented as: \[ 36 [] \].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
\[ <11, (16, 22, 29)>, <15, (12, 22, 25)>, <21, (1, 23, 29)>, <22, (11, 21, 6)>, <24, (0, 25, 20)>, <25, (15, 19, 24)>, <26, (16, 5, 7)>, <28, (8, 14, 18)>, <29, (11, 21, 14)> \].
