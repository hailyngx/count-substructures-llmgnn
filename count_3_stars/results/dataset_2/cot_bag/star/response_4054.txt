Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 11) (20, 15) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 23) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 26) (5, 23) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 12) (7, 29) (7, 12) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 23) (26, 8) (26, 21) (22, 28) (22, 24) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 14) (27, 4) (27, 6) (27, 21) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 9) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 17) (19, 1) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 18) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 16) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 4) (24, 22) (2, 4) (2, 23) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 19) 

Response:
The graph has the following central nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 1: Neighbors {10, 19, 0}  
Node 2: Neighbors {4, 23}  
Node 3: Neighbors {15, 21, 8}  
Node 4: Neighbors {27, 24, 6, 2}  
Node 6: Neighbors {4, 13, 27}  
Node 9: Neighbors {15, 21, 14, 18}  
Node 10: Neighbors {11, 1, 16}  
Node 11: Neighbors {25, 10, 28, 13}  
Node 12: Neighbors {20, 29, 7, 16}  
Node 13: Neighbors {11, 6, 23}  
Node 14: Neighbors {21, 0, 9}  
Node 15: Neighbors {3, 25, 20, 9}  
Node 16: Neighbors {10, 12, 18, 17}  
Node 17: Neighbors {28, 18, 16}  
Node 18: Neighbors {9, 16, 17}  
Node 20: Neighbors {15, 25, 12, 23}  
Node 21: Neighbors {3, 26, 27, 15, 9, 14}  
Node 23: Neighbors {20, 5, 13, 2}  
Node 24: Neighbors {4, 22}  
Node 28: Neighbors {11, 29, 17, 22}  
Node 29: Neighbors {28, 7, 12}  

Now, applying the combinatorial calculation to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 59 3-stars.  
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].  
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
