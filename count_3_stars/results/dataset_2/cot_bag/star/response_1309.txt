- Node 7 has 2 neighbors only. 
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors only. 
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (14, 19, 8) forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors only. 
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors (20, 13, 15, 12) forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors (28, 6, 26) forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors only.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 11, 24) forming 1 3-star.
