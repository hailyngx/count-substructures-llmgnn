Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <0, (7, 9, 4)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (8, 9, 7)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph.
