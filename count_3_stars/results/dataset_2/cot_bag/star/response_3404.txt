Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 13) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 24) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 29) (12, 0) (27, 7) (27, 23) (27, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (18, 19) (18, 23) (11, 8) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 15) (28, 11) (28, 22) (3, 20) (3, 23) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 24) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (26, 21) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 17) (19, 18) (19, 0) (22, 28) (22, 14) (22, 6) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 3) (23, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 16) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 22) (9, 14) (9, 24) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute any 3-stars.

Summing up all the contributions, we get a total of 45 3-stars. So, the final answer is [45].
