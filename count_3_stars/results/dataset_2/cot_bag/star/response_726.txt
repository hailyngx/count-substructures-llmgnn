Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 22) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 23) (27, 9) (27, 6) (15, 20) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 5) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 19) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 23) (26, 28) (26, 19) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 23) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 21) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 29) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 21) (5, 20) (5, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 8) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (2, 12) (4, 22) (4, 25) (22, 3) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 4) (9, 27) (9, 21) (9, 10) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 25) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 16) (21, 14) (21, 17) (21, 9) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 29) (13, 1) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 18) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 0) (24, 28) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 12, 27, 20, 6, 19, 26, 0, 14, 11, 17, 5, 16, 7, 22, 29, 8, 21, 10, 18, 25, 23.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 23, which can be represented as [23].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 17, 29)>
<3, (1, 0, 22)>
<12, (27, 2, 29)>
<27, (12, 29, 23)>
<20, (15, 22, 5)>
<6, (27, 25, 19)>
<19, (6, 26, 23)>
<26, (28, 19, 11)>
<0, (3, 14, 16)>
<14, (0, 7, 21)>
<11, (19, 8, 29)>
<17, (1, 18, 21)>
<5, (20, 8, 16)>
<16, (0, 7, 22)>
<7, (28, 14, 16)>
<22, (3, 20, 16)>
<29, (1, 27, 11)>
<8, (1, 11, 5)>
<21, (14, 17, 9)>
<10, (9, 18, 29)>
<18, (17, 7, 10)>
<25, (6, 4, 18)>
<23, (27, 19, 0)>
