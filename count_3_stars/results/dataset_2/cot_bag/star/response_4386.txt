Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4) - 5 neighbors
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7) - 4 neighbors
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 8) - 4 neighbors
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 0) - 4 neighbors
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 0) - 3 neighbors
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7) - 5 neighbors
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 0) - 5 neighbors
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1) - 3 neighbors
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3) - 3 neighbors
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0) - 5 neighbors

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- For Node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- For Node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- For Node 5: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- For Node 6: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- For Node 7: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- For Node 8: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- For Node 9: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is $10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 55$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 55 ([]).
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (9, 1, 6)>
- <0, (9, 1, 3)>
- <0, (9, 1, 4)>
- <0, (9, 6, 3)>
- <0, (9, 6, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (9, 2, 7)>
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 0, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 5)>
- <7, (1, 6, 3)>
- <7, (5, 6, 3)>
- <7, (5, 3, 6)>
- <9, (5, 2, 8)>
- <9, (5, 2, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
- <9, (2, 8, 0)>
