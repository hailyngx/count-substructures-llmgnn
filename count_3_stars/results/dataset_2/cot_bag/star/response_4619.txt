Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 15) (4, 3) (18, 9) (18, 1) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 13) (10, 6) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 13) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 11, node 7, and node 6.

For node 11:
The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4 neighbors is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 11. 
The 3-stars are: <11, (16, 7, 15)>, <11, (16, 7, 6)>, <11, (7, 17, 15)>, <11, (7, 17, 6)>.

For node 7:
The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5 neighbors is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), so there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 7.
The 3-stars are: <7, (11, 17, 12)>, <7, (11, 17, 3)>, <7, (11, 17, 6)>, <7, (11, 12, 6)>, <7, (11, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (17, 12, 3)>, <7, (17, 12, 6)>, <7, (17, 3, 6)>, <7, (12, 6, 19)>, <7, (3, 6, 19)>

For node 6:
The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5 neighbors is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), so there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 6.
The 3-stars are: <6, (11, 7, 12)>, <6, (11, 7, 19)>, <6, (11, 7, 10)>, <6, (11, 12, 19)>, <6, (11, 12, 10)>, 
<6, (11, 19, 10)>, <6, (7, 12, 19)>, <6, (7, 12, 1)>, <6, (7, 19, 1)>, <6, (12, 19, 1)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 10 + 10 = 24].
