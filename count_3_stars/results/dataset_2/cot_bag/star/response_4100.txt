Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.   

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Summing these up, we have a total of 71 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [71].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
<2, (0, 7, 10)>
<4, (5, 13, 14)>
<5, (4, 12, 13)>
<6, (1, 11, 12)>
<7, (0, 2, 11)>
<9, (1, 6, 14)>
<10, (1, 7, 12)>
<11, (0, 6, 13)>
<12, (0, 5, 10)>
<13, (4, 5, 11)>
