Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 27) (9, 28) (1, 21) (22, 23) (22, 24) (23, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 17) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 28) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (26, 15) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 25) (28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 27) (10, 21) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (11, 24) (11, 20) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 15) (2, 19) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 26) (29, 0) (27, 6) (27, 17) (27, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (5, 14) (5, 27) (5, 20) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 16) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 25) (12, 14) (12, 0) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 11) (20, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
4. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars is [23].
