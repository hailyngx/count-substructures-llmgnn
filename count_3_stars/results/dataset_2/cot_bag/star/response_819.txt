Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 11) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 6) (8, 20) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 5) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 3) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 0) (28, 4) (28, 15) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 25) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 10) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 3) (14, 5) (23, 9) (23, 4) (21, 2) (21, 27) (4, 20) (4, 28) (4, 23) (4, 25) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 28) (11, 29) (11, 6) (25, 10) (25, 4) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors, so let's first identify those nodes and then calculate the total number of 3-stars they participate in.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 13, 17, 20, 4, 5, 6, 9, 24, 26, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms only one 3-star. If a node has more than 3 neighbors, we'll use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars.

1. Node 2: 1 3-star
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
12. Node 29: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, 21, 27>, <3, 1, 19>, <3, 1, 12>, <3, 1, 14>, <3, 7, 19>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 14, 5>, <13, 9, 23>, <13, 9, 15>, <13, 16, 19>, <13, 24, 22>, <17, 18, 12>, <20, 4, 25>, <20, 5, 14>, <20, 6, 11>, <20, 8, 9>, <4, 25, 23>, <5, 14, 7>, <6, 10, 24>, <9, 0, 19>, <24, 13, 15>, <29, 11, 6>, <26, 22, 15>, <21, 27, 29>
