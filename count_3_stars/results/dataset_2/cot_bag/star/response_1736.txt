Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 22) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (0, 20) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 8) (26, 10) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 7) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 6) (28, 18) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 11) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 25) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 22) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 13) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 21) (25, 11) (25, 10) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 11) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 22) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 15) (6, 16) (6, 25) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (12, 14) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 15) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 1  
Node 13: degree 3  
Node 14: degree 2  
Node 15: degree 3  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 17: degree 4  
Node 18: degree 6  
Node 19: degree 2  
Node 20: degree 3  
Node 21: degree 4  
Node 22: degree 4  
Node 23: degree 2  
Node 24: degree 2  
Node 25: degree 3  
Node 26: degree 1  
Node 27: degree 6  
Node 28: degree 2  
Node 29: degree 4  

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:  
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 21, 22, 27, and 29 have three or more neighbors.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:  
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 27: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 64 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (20, 1, 23)>  
<1, (20, 8, 19)>  
<2, (18, 16, 9)>  
<3, (17, 8, 22)>  
<5, (17, 7, 15)>  
<7, (27, 3, 29)>  
<8, (18, 1, 9)>  
<9, (18, 16, 8)>  
<11, (23, 25, 13)>  
<21, (20, 29, 22)>  
<22, (29, 17, 21)>  
<27, (18, 24, 4)>  
<29, (27, 7, 22)>
