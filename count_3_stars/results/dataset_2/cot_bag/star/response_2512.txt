Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with the provided nodes and edges, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 3, 7, 0, 9 
  So, there are C(6,3) = 20 3-stars with node 5: <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 0, 9)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 0)>, <5, (4, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 0, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 0, 9)>, <5, (7, 0, 9)>
  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 0, 5 
  So, there are C(4,3) = 4 3-stars with node 9: <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 0, 5)>, <9, (8, 0, 5)>
  
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, 2 
  There's only 1 3-star with node 6: <6, (9, 3, 2)>
  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, 2 
  There's only 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (5, 3, 2)>
  
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 2, 8 
  So, there are C(5,3) = 10 3-stars with node 3: <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>
  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 0, 2 
  So, there are C(5,3) = 10 3-stars with node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>
  
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5, 4 
  Since 2 neighbors is not enough to form a 3-star, there are no 3-stars with node 7.
  
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, 4 
  There's only 1 3-star with node 8: <8, (9, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 4 
  So, there are C(4,3) = 4 3-stars with node 2: <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 2 
  So, there are C(4,3) = 4 3-stars with node 0: <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>
  
Adding up all 3-stars found, we have a total of [20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 55 3-stars.

Thus, the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 0, 9)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 0)>, <5, (4, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 0, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 0, 9)>, <5, (7, 0, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 0, 5)>, <9, (8, 0, 5)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>
