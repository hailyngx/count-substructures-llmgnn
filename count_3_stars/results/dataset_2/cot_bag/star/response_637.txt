Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the nodes that can form 3-stars.

Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, 8, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 9, 1, 0, 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 0, 3, 5, 1, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 8, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 9, 1, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has neighbors: 7, 9, 1, 5, 2, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 8, 3, 1, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the number of 3-stars gives us a total of \(20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 59\) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (4, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 2)>
<8, (5, 2, 1)>
<8, (7, 9, 1)>
<8, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
