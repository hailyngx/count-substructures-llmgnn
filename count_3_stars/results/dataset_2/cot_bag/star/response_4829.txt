Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {5, 2, 8, 3}
Node 1: Neighbors {6, 2, 4, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors {5, 2, 8, 0, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {6, 5, 1}
Node 5: Neighbors {6, 4, 0, 3, 7}
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3}
Node 8: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 7}
Node 9: Neighbors {8, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
