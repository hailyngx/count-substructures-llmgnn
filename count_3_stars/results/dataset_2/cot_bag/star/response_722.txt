Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (2, 10) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 9) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 19) (1, 12) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes {0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19}. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 15, 8)>, <0, (9, 4, 8)>, <0, (9, 4, 5)>.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
  <3, (0, 12, 17)>.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
  <5, (4, 15, 18)>.

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (0, 3, 12)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 12, 18)>, <8, (4, 9, 18)>.

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
  <10, (2, 6, 11)>.

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <11, (10, 13, 14)>, <11, (10, 13, 16)>, <11, (10, 14, 19)>, <11, (13, 16, 17)>.

- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <12, (0, 1, 6)>, <12, (0, 3, 8)>, <12, (1, 6, 12)>, <12, (3, 6, 12)>.

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
  <13, (2, 11, 16)>.

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <14, (7, 11, 19)>, <14, (7, 16, 19)>, <14, (11, 13, 19)>, <14, (16, 17, 19)>.

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <16, (13, 17, 19)>, <16, (14, 17, 19)>, <16, (17, 19, 1)>, <16, (17, 19, 14)>.

- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
  <17, (3, 16, 19)>.

- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <19, (14, 16, 1)>, <19, (14, 16, 17)>, <19, (16, 17, 1)>, <19, (16, 17, 14)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 30 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So the final answer is [30].
