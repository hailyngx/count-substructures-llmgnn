Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 1) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 8) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 27) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 13) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 0) (28, 5) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 10) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 5) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 15) (10, 24) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (9, 23) (9, 4) (29, 7) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 18) (24, 11) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 2) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (5, 28) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 4) (8, 3) (8, 20) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (25, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 25) (18, 20) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (27, 23) (27, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 1 neighbor
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 1 neighbor
- Node 29 has 1 neighbor

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars. For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 10 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 11 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 13 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star
- Node 16 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 17 can form $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 19 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 20 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 24 can form 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].
