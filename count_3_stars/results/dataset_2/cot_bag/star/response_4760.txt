Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 14) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 17) (7, 13) (7, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 30 \)

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in the graph. Listing unique 3-stars:

[30] 
<0, (1, 8, 18)> <2, (4, 6, 14)> <4, (2, 8, 11)> <5, (1, 13, 16)> <8, (0, 1, 4)> <9, (16, 18, 7)> <13, (5, 7, 8)> <14, (2, 5, 11)> <15, (16, 17, 14)> <18, (2, 3, 9)>
