Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (26, 18) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 27) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 24) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 18) (2, 12) (2, 7) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 27) (20, 4) (0, 29) (0, 19) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 16) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 22) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 8) (28, 15) (28, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 27) (10, 21) (10, 8) (24, 5) (24, 25) (22, 6) (22, 19) (22, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 18) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 7) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 13) (17, 15) (17, 12) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 9, 5, 6, 3, 25, 1, 18, 29, 15, 28, 13, 11, 21, 24, 22, 12, 7, 0, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of [19] 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<9, (5, 6, 16)>, <5, (9, 6, 24)>, <6, (9, 5, 27)>, <3, (25, 1, 11)>, <25, (3, 19, 24)>, <1, (9, 3, 18)>, <18, (26, 1, 29)>, <29, (18, 0, 13)>, <15, (17, 28, 21)>, <28, (15, 21, 8)>, <13, (16, 29, 23)>, <11, (3, 14, 27)>, <21, (28, 23, 8)>, <24, (5, 25, 24)>, <22, (6, 19, 12)>, <12, (25, 22, 17)>, <7, (6, 13, 29)>, <0, (29, 19, 0)>, <19, (25, 22, 0)>.

So, the final answer is: [19].
