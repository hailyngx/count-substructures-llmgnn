Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<2, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 1, 0)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 0, 3)>
<6, (1, 0, 2)>
<7, (1, 0, 3)>
<7, (1, 0, 6)>
<7, (1, 0, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (8, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 0, 7)>
<9, (1, 0, 2)>
<9, (1, 0, 3)>

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 7, 5)>, <1, (0, 7, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 1, 0)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, <2, (6, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 0, 6)>, <3, (1, 0, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <6, (1, 0, 3)>, <6, (1, 0, 2)>, <7, (1, 0, 3)>, <7, (1, 0, 6)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (8, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 0, 7)>, <9, (1, 0, 2)>, <9, (1, 0, 3)>
