Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars around each eligible node.

Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:

- For Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 1)>
<2, (5, 0, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
