Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 6
- Node 1: 7, 3, 6, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 9, 5, 6, 3
- Node 5: 4, 7, 3, 8
- Node 6: 4, 1, 8, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 5, 1
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 3

There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors that can potentially form 3-stars. These are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are 54 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Final answer: [54]
