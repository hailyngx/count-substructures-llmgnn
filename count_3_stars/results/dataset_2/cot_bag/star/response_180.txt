Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 0: This node has 3 neighbors - 4, 6, and 7. As there are 3 neighbors, only 1 3-star can be formed with this node. 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 1: This node has 6 neighbors - 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
The 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 4: This node has 6 neighbors - 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
The 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors - 1, 6, and 8. As there are 3 neighbors, only 1 3-star can be formed with this node. 
<5, (1, 6, 8)>

Node 6: This node has 4 neighbors - 0, 4, 5, and 7. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars with node 6 as the center are:
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 7: This node has 5 neighbors - 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars with node 7 as the center are:
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>

Node 8: This node has 4 neighbors - 1, 2, 4, and 5. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars with node 8 as the center are:
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 9: This node has 5 neighbors - 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9.
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars with node 9 as the center are:
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 70.
Therefore, the answer is [70].
