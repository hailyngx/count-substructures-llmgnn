Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 5, node 8, and node 13. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
Since node 5 has 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 8, and 9), there is 1 3-star formed with node 5 as the center. 
Therefore, there is 1 3-star for node 5.

For node 8:
Since node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 13), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars that can be formed with node 8 as the center.

For node 13:
Since node 13 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed with node 13 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 13) = 15 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>,
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 5)>,
<8, (0, 1, 13)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 5)>,
<8, (0, 2, 13)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 13)>,
<8, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 13)>,
<8, (1, 5, 13)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 13)>,
<13, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<13, (1, 3, 8)>,
<13, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<13, (3, 7, 8)>
