Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 4, 6, 11, 13, 14  
Node 1: 7, 3, 2, 12  
Node 2: 5, 10, 1, 3, 14, 12  
Node 3: 5, 11, 1, 2  
Node 4: 7, 0  
Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 3, 10  
Node 6: 7, 0  
Node 7: 9, 4, 6, 1  
Node 8: 5, 11, 13  
Node 9: 5, 7, 12  
Node 10: 5, 11, 2  
Node 11: 10, 3, 0, 13, 8, 12  
Node 12: 9, 11, 13, 1, 2  
Node 13: 11, 8, 12, 14, 0  
Node 14: 13, 0, 2  
  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20  
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 8: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)  
Node 9: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)  
Node 10: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)  
Node 11: [inom{6}{3}] = 20  
Node 12: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)  
Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 14: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)  

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above, we get a total of 86 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 6, 13)>  
<0, (4, 11, 14)>  
<0, (6, 11, 0)>  
<0, (11, 13, 14)>  
<1, (2, 12, 7)>  
<2, (3, 12, 14)>  
<3, (1, 2, 5)>  
<5, (2, 10, 11)>  
<7, (1, 3, 4)>  
<11, (10, 12, 13)>
