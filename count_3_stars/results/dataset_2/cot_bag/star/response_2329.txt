Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 10) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 8) (0, 20) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 19) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 14) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 23) (5, 13) (5, 15) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 11) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 3) (17, 22) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 19) (16, 21) (16, 7) (12, 28) (12, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 27) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 25) (11, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (1, 28) (24, 22) (24, 2) 

Response:
We first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
  
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}

Edges:  

{0, 4}, {0, 20}, {2, 6}, {2, 8}, {2, 17}, {2, 24}, {2, 29}, {3, 9}, {3, 10}, {3, 13}, {3, 27},  
{4, 18}, {4, 23}, {5, 13}, {5, 15}, {6, 13}, {6, 23}, {7, 16}, {7, 20}, {7, 25}, {8, 14}, {8, 22}, {8, 29},  
{9, 11}, {9, 19}, {9, 26}, {10, 15}, {10, 26}, {11, 12}, {11, 21}, {11, 25}, {13, 3}, {13, 5}, {13, 6}, {13, 22},  
{14, 8}, {14, 18}, {14, 19}, {15, 5}, {15, 10}, {15, 19}, {15, 20}, {16, 7}, {16, 21}, {17, 2}, {17, 22},  
{18, 4}, {18, 14}, {19, 9}, {19, 14}, {19, 15}, {19, 20}, {20, 0}, {20, 7}, {20, 15}, {20, 19}, {21, 11}, {21, 16}, {21, 25}, {21, 28},  
{22, 8}, {22, 13}, {22, 17}, {22, 24}, {23, 4}, {23, 6}, {23, 27}, {24, 2}, {24, 22}, {25, 7}, {25, 11}, {25, 21}, {25, 28},  
{26, 9}, {26, 10}, {27, 3}, {27, 23}, {28, 1}, {28, 12}, {28, 21}, {28, 25}, {29, 2}, {29, 8}

Now, let's go through each node to count the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 2: \({inom{5}{3}} = 10\)  
Node 3: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 4: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)  
Node 6: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)  
Node 8: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 9: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 11: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 13: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 15: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 19: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 20: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 21: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 22: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 23: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)  
Node 25: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 26: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)  
Node 27: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)  
Node 28: \({inom{4}{3}} = 4\)  
Node 29: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 59\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, 8, 14>, <2, 8, 22>, <2, 8, 29>, <2, 17, 22>, <2, 24, 22>, <3, 9, 11>, <3, 9, 19>, <3, 9, 26>, <3, 10, 15>, <3, 13, 5>,  
<3, 13, 6>, <3, 13, 22>, <4, 18, 14>, <4, 18, 23>, <4, 14, 19>, <5, 13, 15>, <6, 13, 23>, <7, 16, 21>, <7, 16, 25>,  
<7, 20, 15>, <7, 20, 19>, <7, 25, 11>, <8, 14, 18>, <8, 14, 19>, <8, 14, 22>, <8, 22, 24>, <11, 12, 28>, <11, 21, 16>,  
<11, 21, 25>, <12, 11, 21>, <13, 5, 15>, <15, 10, 26>, <19, 14, 18>, <19, 14, 20>, <19, 14, 28>, <19, 15, 20>,  
<21, 16, 7>, <21, 16, 25>, <21, 25, 28>, <22, 8, 29>, <23, 4, 18>, <24, 2, 29>
