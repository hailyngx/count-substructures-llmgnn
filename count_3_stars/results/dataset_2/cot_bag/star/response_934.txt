Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 7) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 14) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 10) (19, 5) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (1, 12) (1, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
7. Node 14: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
8. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes: 
Total = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Hence, there are 32 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 19, 10)>, <6, (2, 19, 5)>, <6, (2, 0, 15)>, <6, (2, 19, 10)>, <6, (19, 10, 12)>, <6, (19, 10, 4)>, <6, (19, 5, 7)>, <7, (8, 13, 18)>, <10, (12, 0, 2)>, <10, (12, 0, 15)>, <10, (4, 15, 0)>, <12, (3, 1, 18)>, <17, (16, 15, 4)>, <18, (13, 1, 12)>
