Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, there are 80 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final count inside brackets: [80]
Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
