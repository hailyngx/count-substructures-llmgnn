Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, let's first list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 14
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 8, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 11, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 2, 13, 14, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 3, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 11, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 2, 0, 12
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 13, 6, 8, 0
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 9, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 11, 1
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 6, 12

Now, let's determine the number of unique 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have: [1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 16, which we found by counting the 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors.
