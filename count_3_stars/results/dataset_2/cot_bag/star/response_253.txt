Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 26) (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 1) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 10) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 25) (12, 7) (12, 29) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 10) (1, 27) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 22) (21, 0) (28, 14) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 24) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 29) (19, 1) (19, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 0) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 8) (24, 15) (24, 22) (24, 29) (0, 21) (0, 23) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 25) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 9) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 11 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

2. Node 16 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

3. Node 15 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

4. Node 27 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

5. Node 20 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

6. Node 25 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

7. Node 12 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

9. Node 18 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

10. Node 26 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

11. Node 22 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

12. Node 13 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

13. Node 29 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

14. Node 3 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

15. Node 24 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars: 1

Adding up these counts: $4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 37$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars are: <11, (16, 26, 13)>, <7, (12, 10, 18)>, <18, (4, 7, 10)>, <26, (11, 16, 22)>, <22, (26, 19, 24)>, <13, (11, 7, 17)>, <29, (12, 3, 24)>.
