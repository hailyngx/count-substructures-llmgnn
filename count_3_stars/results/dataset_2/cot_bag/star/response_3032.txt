Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 3, 4, 15, 2, 0, 10, 17, 1, 11, 16, 14, 9, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
\[
\text{Node 3: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \quad \text{(3-stars)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 4: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \quad \text{(3-stars)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 15: } \binom{2}{3} = 0 \quad \text{(no 3-stars)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 2: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 0: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 10: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 17: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 1: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 11: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 16: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \quad \text{(3-stars)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 14: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \quad \text{(1 3-star)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 9: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \quad \text{(3-stars)}
\]
\[
\text{Node 19: } \binom{4}{3} = 4 \quad \text{(3-stars)}
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30 \), which should be written as [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (17, 4, 19)>, 
<4, (3, 0, 14)>, 
<4, (3, 16, 9)>, 
<4, (16, 5, 17)>, 
<15, (7, 14, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 13, 0)>, 
<0, (4, 10, 13)>, 
<10, (18, 6, 0)>, 
<17, (3, 16, 19)>, 
<1, (7, 9, 11)>, 
<11, (5, 13, 1)>, 
<16, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<14, (15, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (16, 14, 19)>, 
<9, (11, 1, 9)>, 
<9, (19, 12, 14)>, 
<9, (19, 16, 9)>.
