Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8, 7
- Node 1: 6, 9, 3, 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 9, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 8, 0, 2
- Node 5: 1, 2, 0
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9, 8, 0, 2
- Node 8: 1, 4, 0, 7
- Node 9: 2, 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 20 + 10 + 4] = 54 \). The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>.
