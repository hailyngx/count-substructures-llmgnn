Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars based on these nodes.

Let's start with node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (nodes 9, 10, 11, 7, and 14). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  
Next, move to node 2:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 10, 11, 8, 14, and 5). So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
  
Next, we have node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 8, 12, 14, and 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  
Moving on to node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (nodes 3, 10, 2, 12, and 13). So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Next, consider node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 14, 10, and 13). So, it forms only 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
  
Move on to node 10:
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (nodes 6, 0, 13, 2, and 5). So, the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Next, analyze node 12:
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors (nodes 9, 4, 14, 13, and 5). So, the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Next, look at node 13:
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors (nodes 6, 9, 3, 10, 7, and 12). So, the number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Finally, consider node 14:
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (nodes 6, 4, 0, 12, and 2). So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  
Summing up the number of 3-stars formed from each node, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 85 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 10, 11)>
- <2, (1, 10, 14)>
- <4, (8, 12, 14)>
- <5, (3, 10, 12)>
- <6, (10, 13, 14)>
- <10, (0, 5, 13)>
- <12, (4, 5, 13)>
- <13, (6, 9, 12)>
- <14, (0, 2, 12)>
