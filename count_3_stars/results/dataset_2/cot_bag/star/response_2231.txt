Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in this scenario can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0 has 3 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 5 edges
- Node 3 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 5 edges
- Node 5 has 5 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 5 edges
- Node 9 has 3 edges

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of the nodes with 3 or more edges, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 42, which can be represented as [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 1, 3)>
- <2, (4, 7, 1)>
- <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (6, 9, 8)>
