Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 10) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 15) (1, 29) (21, 27) (21, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 11) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 24) (17, 19) (8, 19) (23, 3) (23, 5) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 28) (29, 1) (29, 26) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 2) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 29) (26, 24) (26, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 28) (10, 20) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (11, 25) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 20) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (28, 27) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 7) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 0) (5, 23) (5, 26) (18, 12) (18, 24) (18, 10) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 16) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes in the graph with exactly three neighbors, and for each of them, we have 1 3-star. Hence we have 12 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 12)>
<4, (0, 6, 22)>
<6, (2, 4, 24)>
<9, (6, 20, 27)>
<10, (13, 15, 18)>
<12, (2, 18, 21)>
<15, (10, 22, 25)>
<16, (7, 16, 20)>
<19, (11, 16, 19)>
<20, (9, 10, 16)>
<24, (4, 6, 27)>
