Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 10) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 25) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 0) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (8, 14) (8, 27) (23, 15) (23, 24) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (13, 2) (13, 26) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 4) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 7) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 29) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 25) (28, 20) (19, 11) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 15) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 7) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (20, 28) (20, 24) (20, 10) (25, 5) (25, 14) (25, 28) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (29, 12) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 20) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 8) (27, 10) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (24, 18) (24, 23) (24, 20) (4, 26) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 81 3-stars: [81].

Listing unique 3-stars:
<0, 17, 28>, <0, 21, 29>, <0, 22, 29>, <1, 6, 15>, <2, 11, 15>, <3, 7, 21>, <4, 10, 27>, <4, 10, 26>, <5, 25, 14>, <6, 11, 15>, <7, 11, 15>, <8, 14, 25>, <9, 22, 18>, <10, 20, 28>, <10, 22, 5>, <12, 21, 28>, <12, 21, 29>, <13, 26, 4>, <18, 22, 26>, <18, 22, 24>, <18, 22, 29>, <20, 24, 23>
