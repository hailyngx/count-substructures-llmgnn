Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 13) (19, 2) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 5) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 6) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 19) (6, 11) (6, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (0, 3, 16)>, <1, (12, 16, 3)>, <1, (0, 16, 3)>, <1, (12, 0, 3)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (0, 9, 14)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (0, 1, 14)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (6, 9, 16)>, <4, (6, 16, 4)>, <4, (9, 16, 4)>, <4, (9, 6, 4)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (12, 15, 16)>, <5, (12, 15, 18)>, <5, (15, 16, 18)>, <5, (12, 16, 18)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (6, 10, 17)>, <11, (6, 10, 11)>, <11, (17, 10, 6)>, <11, (17, 10, 11)>

For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<12, (1, 7, 18)>, <12, (1, 7, 5)>, <12, (1, 7, 12)>, <12, (1, 18, 5)>, <12, (1, 18, 12)>, 
<12, (1, 5, 12)>, <12, (7, 18, 5)>, <12, (7, 18, 12)>, <12, (7, 5, 12)>, <12, (18, 5, 12)>

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<14, (2, 3, 4)>, <14, (2, 3, 14)>, <14, (2, 4, 14)>, <14, (3, 4, 14)>

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<16, (1, 4, 5)>, <16, (1, 4, 16)>, <16, (1, 5, 16)>, <16, (4, 5, 16)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].
