Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 8) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visually represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 9, and 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 15, and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 17.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 13, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 15, 16, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to node 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 14, and 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 15, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 16, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 13, 17, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 12, and 18.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, represented as [4].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
1. <10, (1, 17, 18)>
2. <17, (7, 10, 18)>
3. <18, (10, 13, 19)>
4. <13, (11, 15, 16)>
