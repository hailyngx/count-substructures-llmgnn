Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 5, 0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 1, 14, 8, 12. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars together:
\( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 94 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<10, (4, 11, 0)>
<11, (4, 10, 5)>
<13, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 11, 8)>
<0, (10, 8, 2)>
<3, (2, 5, 0)>
<6, (11, 2, 3)>
<9, (7, 10, 13)>
<1, (10, 13, 9)>
<14, (7, 10, 13)>
