Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the counts for all nodes with three or more neighbors: 

\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 86 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 86 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this final count inside brackets: [86]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 12>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 13, 10>
<1, 6, 14>
<2, 3, 14>
<3, 9, 13>
<5, 4, 3>
<7, 10, 8>
<7, 10, 13>
<7, 14, 6>
<9, 3, 13>
<10, 13, 6>
<10, 8, 11>
<12, 7, 5>
