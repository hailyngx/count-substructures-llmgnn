Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [71] \]

Therefore, there are a total of 71 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 9, 13)>, <0, (5, 10, 12)>, <0, (6, 10, 14)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 11, 2)>, <1, (8, 3, 2)>, <1, (8, 3, 13)>, <3, (1, 8, 13)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 10, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 1)>, <4, (7, 3, 13)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>, <5, (0, 6, 14)>, <5, (0, 6, 2)>, <5, (10, 12, 0)>, <6, (0, 2, 14)>, <6, (1, 11, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 13)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <10, (4, 7, 6)>, <10, (4, 7, 3)>, <10, (4, 11, 5)>, <10, (11, 2, 14)>.
