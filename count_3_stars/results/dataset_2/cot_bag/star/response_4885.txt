Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 11, 6, 9, 17, 5, 15, 14, 19, 18, 8, 4, 13, 3, 12, and 0.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43 \)

So, there are 43 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (16, 18, 15)>, <6, (9, 2, 1)>, <9, (11, 6, 19)>, <17, (16, 15, 18)>, <5, (6, 10, 14)>, <15, (11, 17, 8)>, <14, (8, 5, 19)>, <19, (9, 14, 3)>, <18, (11, 17, 7)>, <8, (14, 15, 3)>, <3, (8, 4, 19)>
