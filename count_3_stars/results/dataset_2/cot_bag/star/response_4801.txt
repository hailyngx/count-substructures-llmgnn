The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 11) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 5) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 24) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 10) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 27) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 16) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 6) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 22) (5, 3) (5, 12) (8, 3) (14, 1) (14, 22) (0, 15) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 24) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 13) (24, 25) (24, 15) (24, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 19) (23, 1) (23, 27) (27, 16) (27, 23) (27, 9) (9, 27) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges.
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 21, 22, 3, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by all these nodes: 
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 \) 
= 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 71, which we denote as [71].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (21, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 10, 11)>, <21, (1, 20, 16)>, <22, (18, 5, 17)>, <3, (7, 25, 28)>, <10, (19, 6, 12)>, <15, (2, 0, 24)>, <16, (21, 17, 27)>, <17, (22, 25, 28)>, <18, (22, 6, 12)>, <20, (21, 29, 16)>, <24, (25, 15, 12)>, <29, (7, 20, 11)>
