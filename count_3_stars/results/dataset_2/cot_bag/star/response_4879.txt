Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {7, 8, 9, 10, 2} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
   <4, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, <4, (7, 10, 2)>, <4, (9, 10, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 10)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (10, 8, 2)>

2. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 12, 9, 13} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <7, (4, 12, 9)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 9, 13)>, <7, (12, 9, 13)>

3. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 0, 0} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (4, 0, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 0)>

4. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {4, 7, 14, 0, 10} => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
   <9, (4, 7, 14)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 10)>, <9, (4, 14, 0)>, <9, (4, 14, 10)>, <9, (4, 0, 10)>, <9, (7, 14, 0)>, <9, (7, 14, 10)>, <9, (7, 0, 10)>, <9, (14, 0, 10)>

5. Node 12 has 6 neighbors: {7, 2, 5, 0, 6, 1} => [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
   <12, (7, 2, 5)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 6)>, <12, (7, 2, 1)>, <12, (7, 5, 0)>, <12, (7, 5, 6)>, <12, (7, 5, 1)>, <12, (7, 0, 6)>, <12, (7, 0, 1)>, <12, (7, 6, 1)>, <12, (2, 5, 0)>, <12, (2, 5, 6)>, <12, (2, 5, 1)>, <12, (2, 0, 6)>, <12, (2, 0, 1)>, <12, (2, 6, 1)>, <12, (5, 0, 6)>, <12, (5, 0, 1)>, <12, (5, 6, 1)>, <12, (0, 6, 1)>

6. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {7, 3, 1, 10} => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
   <13, (7, 3, 1)>, <13, (7, 3, 10)>, <13, (7, 1, 10)>, <13, (3, 1, 10)>

7. Node 10 has 6 neighbors: {4, 13, 2, 14, 1, 9} => [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
   <10, (4, 13, 2)>, <10, (4, 13, 14)>, <10, (4, 13, 1)>, <10, (4, 13, 9)>, <10, (4, 2, 14)>, <10, (4, 2, 1)>, <10, (4, 2, 9)>, <10, (4, 14, 1)>, <10, (4, 14, 9)>, <10, (4, 1, 9)>, <10, (13, 2, 14)>, <10, (13, 2, 1)>, <10, (13, 2, 9)>, <10, (13, 14, 1)>, <10, (13, 14, 9)>, <10, (13, 1, 9)>, <10, (2, 14, 1)>, <10, (2, 14, 9)>, <10, (2, 1, 9)>, <10, (14, 1, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20] = 72

Hence, the final answer is [72].
