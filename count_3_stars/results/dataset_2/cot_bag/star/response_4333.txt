Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Looking at the list of edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: No 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
- Node 3: 1 3-star.
- Node 4: 1 3-star.
- Node 7: 1 3-star.
- Node 10: 1 3-star.
- Node 11: 1 3-star.
- Node 12: 1 3-star.
- Node 14: 1 3-star.
- Node 15: 1 3-star.
- Node 16: 1 3-star.
- Node 17: 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <3, (1, 5, 16)>
- <4, (0, 15, 17)>
- <7, (0, 10, 13)>
- <10, (7, 11, 17)>
- <11, (4, 12, 17)>
- <12, (2, 11, 16)>
- <14, (1, 15, 18)>
- <15, (4, 8, 14)>
- <16, (5, 6, 12)>
- <17, (0, 4, 10)>
