Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 27) (22, 0) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (1, 16) (1, 28) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 27) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 18) (18, 4) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 19) (18, 23) (24, 6) (26, 6) (26, 11) (21, 3) (21, 8) (20, 17) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 0) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 0) (23, 29) (23, 18) (23, 5) (23, 28) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 25) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 1) (28, 1) (28, 23) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 15) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \) ways to choose 3 nodes to form a 3-star in this graph.

Let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:

- Node 3 has neighbors 12, 15, and 21.
    - There is 1 3-star: <3, (12, 15, 21)>
- Node 6 has neighbors 9, 15, and 24.
    - There is 1 3-star: <6, (9, 15, 24)>
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 6, and 7.
    - There is 1 3-star: <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 11 has neighbors 8, 15, and 26.
    - There is 1 3-star: <11, (8, 15, 26)>
- Node 12 has neighbors 3, 13, and 27.
    - There is 1 3-star: <12, (3, 13, 27)>
- Node 13 has neighbors 12, 25, and 29.
    - There is 1 3-star: <13, (12, 25, 29)>
- Node 15 has neighbors 3, 6, and 11.
    - There is 1 3-star: <15, (3, 6, 11)>
- Node 16 has neighbors 1, 2, and 15.
    - There is 1 3-star: <16, (1, 2, 15)>
- Node 18 has neighbors 4, 18, and 27.
    - There is 1 3-star: <18, (4, 27, 18)>
- Node 19 has neighbors 0, 5, and 25.
    - There is 1 3-star: <19, (0, 5, 25)>
- Node 23 has neighbors 5, 18, and 29.
    - There is 1 3-star: <23, (5, 18, 29)>
- Node 25 has neighbors 0, 7, and 19.
    - There is 1 3-star: <25, (0, 7, 19)>

Therefore, there are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph: <3, (12, 15, 21)>, <6, (9, 15, 24)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <11, (8, 15, 26)>, <12, (3, 13, 27)>, <13, (12, 25, 29)>, <15, (3, 6, 11)>, <16, (1, 2, 15)>, <18, (4, 27, 18)>, <19, (0, 5, 25)>, <23, (5, 18, 29)>, <25, (0, 7, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12, which we represent as [12].
