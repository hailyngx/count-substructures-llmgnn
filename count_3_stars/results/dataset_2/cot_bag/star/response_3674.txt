Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars originating from each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Connected to 5 neighbors
- Node 1: Connected to 5 neighbors
- Node 2: Connected to 5 neighbors
- Node 3: Connected to 4 neighbors
- Node 4: Connected to 4 neighbors
- Node 5: Connected to 5 neighbors
- Node 6: Connected to 2 neighbors
- Node 7: Connected to 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Connected to 4 neighbors
- Node 9: Connected to 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5 each can contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Nodes 3, 4, 8 each can contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Nodes 7, 9 each can contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
