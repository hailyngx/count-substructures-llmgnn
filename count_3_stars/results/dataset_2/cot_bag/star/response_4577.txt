Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 65 \)

So, there are 65 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [65].
