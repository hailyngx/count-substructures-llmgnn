Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 29) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 24) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (12, 2) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 1) (21, 13) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 24) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 9) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 24) (25, 18) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 4) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 26) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 25) (18, 9) (19, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 1
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 1
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 1
- Node 26: degree 5
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Let's find the 3-stars: 

- From the degrees, we can tell that nodes 12, 21, and 25 do not form part of any 3-star since they have less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6, 7, 19 do not form any 3-star as they have exactly 1 neighbor.
- Node 15, 16, 17, 18, 28 do not form any 3-star as they have exactly 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the remaining nodes:

- For node 0, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 2, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 10, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 13, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 14, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 20, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 22, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 23, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 24, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 26, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For node 27, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 29, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 68

So, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in the given graph.
Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
