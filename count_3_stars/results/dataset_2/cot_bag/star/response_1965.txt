Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 22) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 12) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 29) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 20) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (17, 25) (17, 24) (17, 4) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 25) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 26) (16, 6) (28, 14) (28, 16) (18, 5) (18, 29) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 7) (8, 0) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 27) (29, 23) (29, 18) (10, 0) (10, 27) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 20) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 7) (21, 23) (21, 25) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 20) (20, 14) (20, 24) (20, 13) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (27, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Node 4: [0]

Node 6: [0]

Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Node 11: [0]

Node 14: [0]

Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Node 17: [0]

Node 20: [0]

Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 23: [0]

Node 24: [0]

Node 25: [0]

Node 26: [0]

Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 29: [0]

Summing these up: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 14

Therefore, there are 14 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 16, 24)>
<8, (0, 16, 27)>
<9, (5, 12, 22)>
<22, (5, 9, 23)>
<22, (3, 14, 28)>
<22, (14, 20, 28)>
<22, (22, 23, 14)>
<27, (3, 26, 16)>
<27, (19, 27, 10)>
<27, (27, 10, 26)>
<27, (27, 19, 10)>
<27, (19, 27, 10)>
<27, (27, 19, 10)>
<27, (27, 19, 10)>
