Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Starting with node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 7, and 2. Hence, the number of 3-stars centered at node 0 is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Moving to node 1:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, and 7. The number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Continuing with node 2:
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, and 0. There is only 1 3-star centered at node 2, which is <2, (9, 8, 0)>.

Moving on to node 3:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 4, and 5. The number of 3-stars centered at node 3 is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.

Next, node 4:
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, and 0. The number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Moving to node 5:
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, and 8. There is only 1 3-star centered at node 5, which is <5, (6, 3, 8)>.

Continuing with node 6:
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 5, 3, 8, and 0. The number of 3-stars centered at node 6 is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.

Moving on to node 7:
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 0, and 8. There is only 1 3-star centered at node 7, which is <7, (1, 0, 8)>.

Next, node 8:
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 7, 5, and 2. The number of 3-stars centered at node 8 is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.

Finally, node 9:
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 2, and 3. The number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, we get $4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 49$.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 49, which we represent as [49].
