Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (7, 14) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 12) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 11) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (3, 13) (3, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are five nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 6, 9, 12, 15, and 16. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 9.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 12.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 15.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 16.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<6, (2, 8, 18)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 13)>,
<12, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<15, (1, 5, 11)>,
<16, (0, 8, 18)>.
