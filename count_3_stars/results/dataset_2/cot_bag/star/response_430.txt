Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1,3, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 112

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [112].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 7, 13>
<1, 8, 10, 14>
<3, 5, 11, 12>
<6, 8, 9, 13>
<6, 8, 11, 14>
