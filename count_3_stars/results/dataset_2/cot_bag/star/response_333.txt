Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {15, 19, 13, 12}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 15, 10, 17}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 17, 7, 2}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {6, 16, 10, 14}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {18, 3, 14, 12}
Node 9 has 2 neighbors
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {1, 17, 13}
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {9, 0, 8}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {18, 16, 0, 11}
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 16, 8}
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {1, 19, 0, 2}
Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {7, 13, 14}
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {6, 3, 2, 11}
Node 18 has 2 neighbors
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {15, 0, 12}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms 4 3-stars
Node 2 forms 4 3-stars
Node 6 forms 4 3-stars
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars
Node 8 forms 4 3-stars
Node 11 forms 1 3-star
Node 12 forms 1 3-star
Node 13 forms 4 3-stars
Node 14 forms 4 3-stars
Node 15 forms 4 3-stars
Node 16 forms 1 3-star
Node 17 forms 4 3-stars
Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get: 
\(4+4+4+4+4+1+1+4+4+4+1+4+1 = 32\)

Therefore, there are a total of [32] unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:
<0, (15, 19, 13, 12)>, <2, (6, 15, 10, 17)>, <6, (9, 17, 7, 2)>, <7, (6, 16, 10, 14)>, <8, (18, 3, 14, 12)>, <11, (1, 17, 13)>, <13, (18, 16, 0, 11)>, <14, (5, 7, 16, 8)>, <15, (1, 19, 0, 2)>, <16, (7, 13, 14)>, <17, (6, 3, 2, 11)>, <19, (15, 0, 12)>
