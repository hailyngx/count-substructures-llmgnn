Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 15 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 forms 6 3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 6 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get: 
\[ [4 + 15 + 6 + 6] = [31] \]
