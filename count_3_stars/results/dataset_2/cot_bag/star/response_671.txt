Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 2 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \(4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 56\) 3-stars.

So, the final count of 3-stars is [56]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
