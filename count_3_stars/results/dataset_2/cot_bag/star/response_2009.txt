Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 60 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 10, 13)>
<2, (6, 11, 13)>
<3, (0, 6, 13)>
<4, (6, 14, 13)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 13)>
<6, (3, 7, 12)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 13)>
<10, (0, 11, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
