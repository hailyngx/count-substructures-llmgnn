Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors {5, 6, 7, 0}.
- Node 3 has neighbors {5, 9, 6, 1, 4}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {9, 1, 3, 8}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {9, 6, 2, 3, 7}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {5, 9, 3, 2, 8}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {6, 1, 4, 7}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {5, 6, 4, 3}.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for the identified nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 42 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [42].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (5, 9, 6)>

<3, (5, 2, 3)>
