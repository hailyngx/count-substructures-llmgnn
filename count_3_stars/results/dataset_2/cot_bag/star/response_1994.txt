Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 4, 9, 1, 13, 8, 14, 11, 12, 6, 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 13, 12, 11, 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (13, 12, 11)>, <5, (13, 12, 4)>, <5, (13, 11, 4)>, <5, (12, 11, 4)>

Node 14:

- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <14, (9, 8, 6)>, <14, (9, 8, 10)>, <14, (9, 6, 10)>, <14, (8, 6, 10)>

Node 12:
- Neighbors: 5, 1, 11, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <12, (5, 1, 11)>, <12, (5, 1, 2)>, <12, (5, 11, 2)>, <12, (1, 11, 2)>

Node 6:

- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (8, 14, 7)>, <6, (8, 14, 10)>, <6, (8, 7, 10)>, <6, (14, 7, 10)>

Node 10:
- Neighbors: 9, 1, 8, 14, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have: \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [81] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 81.
