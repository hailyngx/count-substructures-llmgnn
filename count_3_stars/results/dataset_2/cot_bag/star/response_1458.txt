Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 66

Hence, there are a total of 66 3-stars.
So, the answer is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
