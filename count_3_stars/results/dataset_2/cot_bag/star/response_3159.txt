Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's analyze the nodes to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 2 edges.
- Node 6 has 4 edges.
- Node 4 has 4 edges.
- Node 9 has 6 edges.
- Node 0 has 5 edges.
- Node 14 has 4 edges.
- Node 13 has 2 edges.
- Node 10 has 6 edges.
- Node 2 has 5 edges.
- Node 12 has 5 edges.
- Node 3 has 4 edges.
- Node 8 has 2 edges.
- Node 7 has 5 edges.
- Node 11 has 3 edges.
- Node 1 has 4 edges.

Nodes 9 and 10 have 6 edges each, which indicates they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
Nodes 0, 2, and 12 have 5 edges each, so they can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Nodes 4, 6, 7, and 1 have 4 edges each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Nodes 3, 14 have 4 edges each, but they are not central in any 3-star.
Nodes 5, 13, 8, and 11 have less than 4 edges, so they cannot form any 3-star.
  
Summing up the 3-stars formed, we get \( [20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 76 \).

Therefore, the final answer is  [76].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <9, (5, 7, 11)>
- <9, (5, 7, 1)>
- <10, (12, 0, 1)>
- <10, (3, 12, 7)>
- <10, (3, 2, 7)>
- <0, (14, 6, 4)>
- <0, (14, 6, 13)>
- <0, (14, 6, 10)>
- <2, (4, 10, 12)>
- <12, (0, 10, 1)>
- <4, (9, 6, 0)>
- <4, (9, 6, 13)>
- <6, (9, 4, 0)>
- <6, (9, 4, 2)>
