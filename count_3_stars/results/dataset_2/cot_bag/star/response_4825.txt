Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes and sum them up.

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 6 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 66 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [66], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 8, 12)>
<1, (5, 10, 12)>
<1, (8, 10, 12)>
<1, (8, 10, 10)>
<2, (3, 9, 10)>
<4, (6, 7, 14)>
<6, (0, 7, 12)>
<7, (3, 9, 13)>
<9, (2, 10, 13)>
<10, (3, 9, 13)>
<11, (5, 7, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 8)>
