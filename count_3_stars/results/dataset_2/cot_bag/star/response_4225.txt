Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, here is the construction of the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 13, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, and 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 13, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4 and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 10, 12, and 3.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 13)> and <1, (7, 10, 14)>.
- Node 4 forms three 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 10)>, <4, (1, 10, 13)>, and <4, (0, 6, 11)>.
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 10, 14)>.
- Node 10 forms one 3-star: <10, (1, 7, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 3 + 1 + 1] = [7].
