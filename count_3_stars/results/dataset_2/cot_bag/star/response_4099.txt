Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, first, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14.

Now, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up:

4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 9, 13)>, <6, (3, 5, 14)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (4, 8, 13)>, <10, (0, 5, 14)>, <14, (0, 6, 10)>.
