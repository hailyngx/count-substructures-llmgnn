Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 7 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now we can count the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1: 1 3-star (by itself)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 80

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (2, 0, 5)>
<2, (2, 1, 7)>
<2, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (4, 2, 5)>
<4, (4, 3, 9)>
<4, (4, 6, 5)>
<5, (5, 0, 2)>
<5, (5, 3, 9)>
<5, (5, 4, 6)>
<5, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (9, 2, 5)>
