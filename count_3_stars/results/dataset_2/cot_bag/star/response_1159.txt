Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}

We can see that the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors and hence potential 3-stars can be formed using those nodes.

The total number of 3-stars is given by the sum of \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of those nodes:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 55 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
