Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's analyze each of those nodes to find the 3-stars formed:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (9, 6, 14), (6, 8, 13), (6, 7, 14)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8, 10), (8, 13, 11)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (9, 13, 6), (8, 13, 11), (13, 3, 14)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (9, 10, 8), (10, 11, 13)

Counting these unique 3-stars and taking into account the 3-star with node 5, which has only 1 neighbor, we have a total of [4+1] = 5 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, 9, 6, 14>, 
<6, 8, 13>, 
<6, 7, 14>, 
<9, 8, 10>, 
<9, 13, 6>.
