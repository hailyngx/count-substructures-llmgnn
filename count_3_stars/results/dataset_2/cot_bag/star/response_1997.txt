Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes in this graph with 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, and node 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: nodes 8, 5, 3, 11, and 0.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors of node 2 to form a 3-star.
- So, there are 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 12, 0, 14, 11, and 6.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors of node 4 to form a 3-star.
- So, there are 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: nodes 5, 3, 1, 9, 14, and 0.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors of node 13 to form a 3-star.
- So, there are 20 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 20] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (8, 5, 3)>
<4, (12, 0, 14)>
<13, (5, 1, 9)>
<13, (5, 1, 14)>
