Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [22] 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 11, 14)>
<1, (0, 13, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 12)>
<3, (2, 4, 12)>
<4, (3, 5, 11)>
<5, (4, 9, 14)>
<6, (8, 10, 13)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<8, (6, 11, 13)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
<11, (0, 4, 8)>
<12, (2, 3, 4)>
<13, (1, 6, 8)>
<14, (0, 1, 5)>
