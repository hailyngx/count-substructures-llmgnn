Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (as only 4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (as only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (as only 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (as only 4 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>.
