Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 4, 12)>
<4, (8, 17, 13)>
<4, (12, 2, 5)>
<4, (12, 2, 15)>
<4, (17, 8, 0)>
<5, (2, 15, 16)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<9, (14, 1, 11)>
<9, (16, 18, 15)>
<13, (11, 18, 3)>
<14, (9, 16, 18)>
<18, (13, 11, 1)>
<19, (3, 10, 9)>
<19, (0, 6, 5)>
