Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

\[ 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ <0, (1, 6, 14)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 13)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 10, 11)>, <10, (1, 3, 5)>, <11, (0, 10, 14)>, <14, (0, 6, 11)> \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is given by [120].
