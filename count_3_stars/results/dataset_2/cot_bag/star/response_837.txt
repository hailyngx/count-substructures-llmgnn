Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 12) (1, 17) (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 11) (13, 26) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 0) (22, 1) (22, 13) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 25) (10, 26) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 29) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 5) (6, 3) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 4) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 14) (18, 1) (18, 4) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 0) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 27) (28, 5) (28, 3) (28, 24) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 0) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 7) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 23) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 27) (14, 20) (14, 23) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 24) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 5) (23, 27) (23, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify these nodes and find the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (17, 22, 18) - 1 3-star
2. Node 4: Has 5 neighbors (8, 18, 25, 20, 2) - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (6, 2, 25, 28) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (4, 20, 29) - 1 3-star
5. Node 10: Has 3 neighbors (26, 11, 15) - 1 3-star
6. Node 11: Has 4 neighbors (21, 10, 24, 27) - 4 3-stars
7. Node 12: Has 3 neighbors (26, 0, 2) - 1 3-star
8. Node 13: Has 4 neighbors (26, 22, 29, 0) - 4 3-stars
9. Node 15: Has 3 neighbors (9, 10, 20) - 1 3-star
10. Node 17: Has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 22, 27) - 4 3-stars
11. Node 20: Has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 15, 14) - 4 3-stars
12. Node 22: Has 4 neighbors (1, 13, 17, 25) - 4 3-stars
13. Node 24: Has 3 neighbors (11, 28, 7) - 1 3-star
14. Node 25: Has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 22) - 1 3-star
15. Node 27: Has 5 neighbors (11, 17, 3, 29, 23) - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
16. Node 28: Has 3 neighbors (5, 3, 24) - 1 3-star
17. Node 29: Has 3 neighbors (13, 8, 27) - 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 10) + 4 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 12) + 4 (from node 13) + 1 (from node 15) + 4 (from node 17) + 4 (from node 20) + 4 (from node 22) + 1 (from node 24) + 1 (from node 25) + 10 (from node 27) + 1 (from node 28) + 1 (from node 29)
= 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].
