Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 23) (22, 5) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 19) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 0) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 28) (8, 27) (11, 21) (11, 9) (11, 29) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 5) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 6) (28, 19) (0, 7) (0, 26) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 24) (25, 2) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 16) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 11) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 18) (19, 16) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 2) (20, 27) (23, 13) (23, 15) (24, 4) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 2) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 19) (2, 25) (2, 3) (2, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph are:  
- Node 1 with 3 neighbors
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors
- Node 4 with 2 neighbors
- Node 5 with 3 neighbors
- Node 6 with 5 neighbors
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors
- Node 9 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors
- Node 12 with 2 neighbors
- Node 13 with 2 neighbors
- Node 14 with 3 neighbors
- Node 15 with 3 neighbors
- Node 16 with 3 neighbors
- Node 19 with 4 neighbors
- Node 21 with 3 neighbors
- Node 22 with 4 neighbors
- Node 24 with 3 neighbors
- Node 25 with 4 neighbors
- Node 26 with 5 neighbors
- Node 27 with 4 neighbors
- Node 28 with 4 neighbors
- Node 29 with 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 

<1, (21, 5, 11)>
<3, (17, 5, 21)>
<5, (17, 3, 21)>
<9, (26, 11, 29)>
<11, (21, 1, 5)>
<14, (28, 6, 12)>
<15, (26, 15, 23)>
<16, (19, 15, 25)>
<21, (5, 1, 11)>
<24, (25, 4, 27)>
