Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph and calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

The edges in the graph are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 22, 10, 18
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 27
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 16
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 26, 29
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 24, 14, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 28, 3
- Node 6 is connected to node 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 17, 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 19, 12, 22
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 13, 0
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 23, 0
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 19, 2, 18, 26
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 10, 7
- Node 14 is connected to node 4
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 20, 29, 24
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 22, 2, 26
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 20, 16, 7
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 12, 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 21, 8, 12
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 29
- Node 21 is connected to node 19
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 25, 8, 16, 0
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 11, 24
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 15, 28, 23, 4
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 26, 28, 22
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 25, 3, 12, 16
- Node 27 is connected to node 1
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 25, 24
