Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 20) (1, 23) (1, 12) (1, 6) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 25) (4, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 27) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 28) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 28) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 17) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 28) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 27) (2, 26) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 8) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 24) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 18) (27, 7) (27, 26) (27, 14) (24, 16) (24, 5) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (6, 1) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{n}{3} =  \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 = 89 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [89].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 20, 25)>
<3, (15, 23, 9)>
<6, (1, 20, 25)>
<7, (14, 27, 4)>
<8, (9, 16, 17)>
<9, (8, 15, 21)>
<13, (22, 12, 14)>
<14, (7, 11, 27)>
<15, (3, 9, 23)>
<16, (8, 22, 24)>
<19, (17, 22, 26)>
<20, (6, 22, 28)>
<21, (9, 18, 25)>
<22, (13, 19, 20)>
<25, (18, 21, 6)>
<26, (19, 27, 2)>
<28, (0, 15, 20)>
