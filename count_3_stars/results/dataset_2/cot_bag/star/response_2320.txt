Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 4, 7, 2
- Node 2: 5, 1, 3
- Node 3: 5, 4, 7, 2
- Node 4: 9, 8, 3, 1
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 0
- Node 6: 1, 0
- Node 7: 5, 3, 1, 8
- Node 8: 9, 4, 7, 0
- Node 9: 5, 8, 4, 0

Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed for each node:

- Node 0: [3]
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3} = 4]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4] = [43].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 6, 0>
<4, 9, 8>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 2, 1>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 0, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 3, 7>
