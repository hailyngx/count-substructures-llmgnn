Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
