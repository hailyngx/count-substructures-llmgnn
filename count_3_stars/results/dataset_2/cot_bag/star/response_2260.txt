Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
There are only two nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4 and 1.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4:
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 4: 7, 0, 10, and 6.
Using the formula \( \text{inom} {4}{3} = 4 \), we find that there are 4 possible 3-stars for node 4.

Node 1:
There are 5 neighbors connected to node 1: 7, 8, 13, 0, and 5.
Using the formula \( \text{inom} {5}{3} = 10 \), we find that there are 10 possible 3-stars for node 1.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 1) = 14

Thus, there are 14 3-stars in the graph. We can list the unique 3-stars as follows: <4, (7, 0, 10)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (7, 10, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 13)>, <1, (7, 8, 0)>, <1, (7, 13, 0)>, <1, (8, 13, 0)>, <1, (7, 8, 5)>, <1, (7, 13, 5)>, <1, (8, 13, 5)>. 

Putting the final count inside brackets:
[14]
