Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9  
Node 1: 3, 5  
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 8  
Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9  
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6  
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8  
Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9  
Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 7, 9)> (Note: This is the same as <4, (2, 7, 9)>)  
<4, (0, 7, 9)>  
<4, (2, 7, 9)> (Note: This is the same as <2, (4, 7, 9)>)  
<7, (0, 4, 9)>  
<7, (2, 4, 9)> (Note: This is the same as <2, (4, 7, 9)>)  
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
