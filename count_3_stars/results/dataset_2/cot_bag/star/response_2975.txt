Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 12)>, <3, (7, 0, 13)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (13, 10, 14)>, <13, (5, 6, 9)>, <14, (2, 8, 11)>.
