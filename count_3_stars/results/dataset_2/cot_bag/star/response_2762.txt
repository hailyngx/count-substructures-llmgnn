Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (18, 1) (18, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (17, 19) (17, 7) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes: 1, 0, 12, 14, 5, 4, 8, 11, 10, 19, 7, 16, 6.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and find the total:

1. Node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 0: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 12: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 14: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 5: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 4: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 8: 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
8. Node 11: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 10: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 19: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 7: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 16: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 6: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:

<14, 9, 0>
