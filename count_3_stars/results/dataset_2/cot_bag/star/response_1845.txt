Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 19, 18)>
<1, (3, 7, 4)>
<4, (6, 17, 5)>
<5, (14, 12, 18)>
<7, (1, 12, 16)>
<10, (3, 2, 17)>
<12, (17, 7, 5)>
<13, (9, 19, 15)>
<14, (17, 2, 5)>
<16, (17, 7, 19)>
<17, (14, 10, 4)>
<19, (8, 13, 16)>
