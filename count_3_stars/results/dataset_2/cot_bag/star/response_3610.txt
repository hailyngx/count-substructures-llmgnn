Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (4, 9, 7, 13, 2, 10)
- Node 1: (2, 13, 11, 14, 10)
- Node 3: (7, 13, 9, 14, 12)
- Node 5: (13, 8, 11)
- Node 7: (4, 0, 3, 14, 8)
- Node 8: (7, 5, 10, 12)
- Node 10: (2, 8, 0, 9, 1, 14)
- Node 11: (5, 13, 1, 12)
- Node 12: (6, 8, 3, 11)
- Node 13: (5, 11, 3, 1, 0)
- Node 14: (7, 2, 10, 3, 1)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing these up: 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 93

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [93].
