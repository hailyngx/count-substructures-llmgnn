Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 13) (7, 19) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 14) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 10: 4 neighbors
Node 11: 1 neighbor
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 5 neighbors
Node 14: 2 neighbors
Node 15: 3 neighbors
Node 17: 4 neighbors
Node 18: 4 neighbors
Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 8, 13)>, 
<1, (11, 14, 18)>, 
<2, (9, 12, 17)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 15)>, 
<5, (9, 10, 13)>, 
<8, (0, 12, 13)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 13)>, 
<10, (5, 17, 18)>, 
<12, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<13, (4, 5, 18)>, 
<17, (10, 15, 19)>, 
<18, (1, 10, 14)>.
