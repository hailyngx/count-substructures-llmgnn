Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 4) (22, 25) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 19) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 21) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 16) (21, 12) (21, 24) (24, 21) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 15) (5, 19) (5, 26) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 23) (20, 27) (20, 29) (10, 1) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 25) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 3) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 27) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 2) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 10, 14, 17, 18. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 27. There is only 1 3-star with node 2 at the center. 
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 22. There is only 1 3-star with node 4 at the center. 
4. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 11, 14, 28. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 17, 23. There is only 1 3-star with node 7 at the center. 
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 18, 26. There is only 1 3-star with node 8 at the center. 
7. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 8, 15, 23. There is only 1 3-star with node 9 at the center. 
8. Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 7, 21. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed. 
9. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 16. There is only 1 3-star with node 14 at the center. 
10. Node 15 has 5 neighbors: 9, 16, 17, 25, 26. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
11. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 14, 15, 3. There is only 1 3-star with node 16 at the center. 
12. Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 15, 23, 25. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
13. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 11, 25. There is only 1 3-star with node 18 at the center. 
14. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 5, 28, 29. There is only 1 3-star with node 19 at the center. 
15. Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 27, 29. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed. 
16. Node 21 has 2 neighbors: 12, 24. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed. 
17. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 7, 9, 17. There is only 1 3-star with node 23 at the center. 
18. Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 17, 18, 15, 22, 25. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
19. Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 15. There is only 1 3-star with node 26 at the center. 
20. Node 27 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 20, 29, 23. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
21. Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 6, 19, 29, 28. There is only 1 3-star with node 28 at the center.
22. Node 29 has 5 neighbors: 19, 20, 27, 28, 29. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 60\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 10)>, <1, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (2, 10, 17)>, <1, (5, 10, 14)>, <1, (5, 10, 17)>, <1, (10, 14, 17)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 6, 14)>, <6, (3, 6, 11)>, <6, (3, 6, 28)>, <6, (4, 6, 22)>, <6, (4, 6, 28)>, <6, (11, 14, 16)>, <6, (11, 14, 17)>, <6, (11, 14, 18)>, <7, (8, 15, 17)>, <9, (8, 15, 26)>, <14, (1, 6, 16)>, <15, (9, 15, 26)>, <15, (9, 15, 25)>, <15, (16, 17, 25)>, <17, (1, 15, 25)>, <17, (1, 17, 25)>, <17, (15, 17, 25)>, <18, (1, 8, 25)>, <23, (7, 9, 23)>, <25, (17, 18, 25)>, <25, (17, 25, 26)>, <25, (18, 25, 26)>, <27, (2, 27, 29)>, <27, (20, 27, 29)>, <27, (23, 27, 29)>, <27, (27, 29, 23)>.
