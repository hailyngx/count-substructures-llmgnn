Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Node 0 has neighbors 5, 1, 7, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2:
Node 2 has neighbors 9, 4, 7, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 4:
Node 4 has neighbors 5, 7, 3, and 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 5:
Node 5 has neighbors 9, 4, 0, 3, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 7:
Node 7 has neighbors 5, 9, 4, 0, and 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 9:
Node 9 has neighbors 5, 2, 1, 7, and 0. So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up the 3-stars from all central nodes, we have:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
