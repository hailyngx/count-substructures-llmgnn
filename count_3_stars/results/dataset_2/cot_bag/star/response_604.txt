Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: 1 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: 1 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 40 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, 4, 5>
