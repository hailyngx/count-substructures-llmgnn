Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given list of edges, we can determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (degree 3), there is only 1 3-star each.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we use the formula \( \binom{d}{3} \), where \( d \) is the degree of the node.

Calculating for each node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For the rest of the nodes with degrees 4, 5, and 6, we calculate \( \binom{d}{3} \): 

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together:
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of 77 3-stars in this graph:

[77]
