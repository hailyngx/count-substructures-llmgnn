Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 22 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 25 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 27 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 63 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [63]. 
Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
