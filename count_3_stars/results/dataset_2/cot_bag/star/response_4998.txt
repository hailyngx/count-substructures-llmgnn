Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 82 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is given by [82].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 9, 14)>
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 11)>
<10, (2, 5, 11)>
<11, (3, 7, 9)>
<13, (7, 8, 14)>
<14, (0, 2, 13)>
