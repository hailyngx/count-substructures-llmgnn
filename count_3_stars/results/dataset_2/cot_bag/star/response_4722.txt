Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 15) (11, 7) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 16) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 17) (9, 10) (9, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 3, 15, 2, 10, 14, 7, 17, 13, 4, 18, 6, 16, 12, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (15, 7, 2)>, <3, (15, 2, 12)>, <3, (15, 2, 7)>, <3, (7, 2, 12)>

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (3, 4, 11)>, <15, (3, 11, 7)>, <15, (3, 11, 4)>, <15, (11, 7, 4)>

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (3, 8, 10)>, <2, (3, 10, 14)>, <2, (8, 10, 14)>, <2, (3, 14, 10)>, <2, (10, 14, 4)>, <2, (14, 4, 5)>, <2, (14, 4, 17)>, <2, (10, 4, 17)>, <2, (4, 17, 7)>, <2, (4, 17, 5)>

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (0, 14, 2)>, <10, (0, 2, 9)>, <10, (2, 14, 4)>, <10, (2, 14, 16)>

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<14, (10, 4, 16)>, <14, (10, 16, 6)>, <14, (4, 16, 6)>, <14, (16, 6, 18)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (3, 11, 17)>, <7, (3, 17, 7)>, <7, (11, 17, 4)>, <7, (17, 4, 5)>

For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<17, (8, 7, 9)>, <17, (8, 7, 4)>, <17, (8, 4, 9)>, <17, (7, 4, 9)>, <17, (7, 9, 10)>, <17, (4, 9, 10)>, <17, (9, 10, 14)>, <17, (9, 10, 16)>, <17, (10, 14, 16)>, <17, (14, 16, 18)>

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (5, 18, 19)>, <13, (5, 19, 12)>, <13, (18, 19, 12)>, <13, (5, 18, 12)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (15, 7, 17)>, <4, (15, 17, 5)>, <4, (7, 17, 5)>, <4, (15, 17, 9)>, <4, (7, 17, 9)>, <4, (17, 5, 9)>, <4, (17, 5, 14)>, <4, (17, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 14, 16)>

For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<18, (13, 6, 16)>, <18, (13, 16, 12)>, <18, (6, 16, 12)>, <18, (13, 6, 12)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 16, 18)>, <6, (1, 18, 6)>, <6, (16, 18, 12)>, <6, (1, 18, 16)>

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<16, (14, 6, 18)>, <16, (14, 18, 12)>, <16, (6, 18, 12)>, <16, (14, 6, 12)>

For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<12, (3, 19, 18)>, <12, (3, 18, 12)>, <12, (19, 18, 12)>, <12, (3, 19, 18)>

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<19, (13, 1, 12)>, <19, (13, 12, 18)>, <19, (1, 12, 18)>, <19, (13, 1, 18)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].
