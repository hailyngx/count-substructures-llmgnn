Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 12) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 2) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 21) (8, 5) (8, 0) (23, 4) (23, 17) (3, 21) (3, 5) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 29) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 6) (17, 23) (17, 27) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 26) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (15, 28) (19, 29) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 9) (6, 7) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 4) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (26, 20) (26, 29) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 2) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 27) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (4, 23) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 2) (4, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 13) (9, 11) (9, 19) (28, 15) (28, 4) (13, 19) (13, 27) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them with the number of neighbors each has:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 7 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 82 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [82]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (2, 19, 28)>
- <4, (10, 16, 5)>
- <4, (2, 14, 16)>
- <4, (24, 23, 19)>
- <4, (24, 22, 15)>
- <5, (16, 10, 15)>
- <7, (0, 6, 11)>
- <15, (22, 10, 28)>
- <15, (22, 25, 21)>
- <15, (22, 24, 4)>
- <16, (10, 14, 21)>
- <19, (2, 9, 29)>
- <20, (29, 26, 2)>
- <21, (25, 14, 16)>
- <22, (18, 24, 25)>
- <22, (12, 16, 21)>
- <22, (15, 25, 21)>
- <22, (24, 12, 21)>
- <27, (2, 1, 13)>
- <29, (20, 0, 26)>
