Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 1, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
