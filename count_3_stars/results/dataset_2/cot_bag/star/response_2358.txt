Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (since each combination of 3 neighbors forms a 3-star)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
\( 4 + 4 + 3 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 10 = 61 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
