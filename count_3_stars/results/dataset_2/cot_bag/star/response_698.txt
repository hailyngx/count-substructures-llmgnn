Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 5) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are no nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Hence, no 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 0, which is written as [0].
