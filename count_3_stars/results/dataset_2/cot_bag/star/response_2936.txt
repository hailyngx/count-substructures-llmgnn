Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 0) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 5) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 17) (2, 6) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 14) (29, 4) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 4) (11, 16) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 28) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 11) (21, 28) (21, 4) (8, 5) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 12) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 10) (19, 3) (19, 24) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 17) (7, 29) (7, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 14) (18, 20) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 6) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 21) (4, 17) (12, 23) (12, 14) (13, 29) (13, 20) (6, 2) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 28) (10, 6) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 4) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 148.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [148].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (16, 11, 1)>, <4, (25, 4, 29)>, <5, (20, 5, 15)>, <6, (10, 6, 25)>, <15, (1, 15, 25)>, <18, (6, 18, 23)>, <20, (13, 20, 5)>, <22, (17, 22, 28)>, <23, (12, 23, 18)>, <25, (4, 25, 15)>, <28, (16, 28, 10)>, <29, (4, 29, 13)>.
