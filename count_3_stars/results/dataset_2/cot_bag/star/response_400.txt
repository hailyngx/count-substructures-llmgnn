Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 0)>
<0, (7, 8, 0)>

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (8, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 2)>
<2, (8, 0, 2)>
<2, (8, 1, 2)>
<2, (8, 3, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 8, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 1, 2)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (8, 2, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 3)>

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (6, 2, 4)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 0, 5)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (1, 4, 6)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 8, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (8, 0, 7)>

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 0, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 2, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 8)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (1, 3, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 43\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [43].
