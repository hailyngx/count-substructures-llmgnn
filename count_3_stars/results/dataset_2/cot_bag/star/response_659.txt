Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 6: There are {{6}\choose{3}} = 20 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so we have 20 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 
- Node 0: There are {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 0, so we have 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1: There are {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 1, so we have 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2: There are {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 2, so we have 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4: There are {{3}\choose{3}} = 1 way to choose 3 neighbors for node 4, so we have 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7: There are {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 7, so we have 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8: There are {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 8, so we have 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9: There are {{3}\choose{3}} = 1 way to choose 3 neighbors for node 9, so we have 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
