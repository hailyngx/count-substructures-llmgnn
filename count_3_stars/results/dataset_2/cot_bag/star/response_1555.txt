Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 8) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 8) (9, 7) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 4) (19, 3) (19, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges grouped by their starting node:

- Node 0: (0, 8), (0, 16)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 17)
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 15), (2, 17)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 17), (3, 19)
- Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 14)
- Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 18)
- Node 6: (6, 16), (6, 18)
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 18)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 10)
- Node 9: (9, 7)
- Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 16)
- Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 12), (11, 14), (11, 16)
- Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 11), (12, 15)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 17)
- Node 15: (15, 2), (15, 12), (15, 18)
- Node 16: (16, 0), (16, 6), (16, 10), (16, 11)
- Node 17: (17, 3), (17, 1), (17, 2), (17, 14)
- Node 18: (18, 5), (18, 6), (18, 7), (18, 15)
- Node 19: (19, 3), (19, 13)

Now, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 7, 17)>, <3, (1, 4, 19)>, <7, (1, 12, 18)>, <11, (10, 14, 16)>, <17, (1, 2, 14)>, <18, (5, 6, 15)>.
