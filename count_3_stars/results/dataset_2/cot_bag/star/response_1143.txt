Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)> are the unique 3-stars for node 0.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 9, 7)> are the unique 3-stars for node 2.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)> are the unique 3-stars for node 4.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)> are the unique 3-stars for node 5.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Total number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)> are the unique 3-stars for node 7.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 58 \). So, the total number of 3-stars is [58].
