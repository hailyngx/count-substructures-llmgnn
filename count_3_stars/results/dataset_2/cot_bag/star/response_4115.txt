Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 6, 0, 14, 13, 12, 2, 3, and 1. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>

For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) as it has only two neighbors.

For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) as it has only two neighbors.

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (3, 11, 10)>, <7, (3, 11, 8)>, <7, (3, 10, 8)>, <7, (11, 10, 8)>

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<10, (7, 11, 0)>, <10, (7, 11, 2)>, <10, (7, 0, 2)>, <10, (11, 0, 2)>

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<11, (7, 10, 0)>, <11, (7, 10, 6)>, <11, (7, 0, 6)>, <11, (10, 0, 6)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (5, 7, 4)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (7, 4, 0)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (5, 11, 14)>, <6, (5, 11, 2)>, <6, (5, 14, 2)>, <6, (11, 14, 2)>

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (10, 11, 14)>, <0, (10, 11, 13)>, <0, (10, 14, 13)>, <0, (11, 14, 13)>

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (6, 0, 1)>, <14, (6, 0, 2)>, <14, (6, 1, 2)>, <14, (0, 1, 2)>

For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<13, (0, 12, 2)>

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<12, (11, 13, 2)>

For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<2, (9, 10, 6)>, <2, (9, 10, 14)>, <2, (9, 10, 13)>, <2, (9, 6, 14)>, <2, (9, 6, 13)>, <2, (9, 14, 13)>, <2, (10, 6, 14)>, <2, (10, 6, 13)>, <2, (10, 14, 13)>, <2, (6, 14, 13)>, <2, (11, 12, 3)>, <2, (11, 12, 13)>, <2, (11, 3, 13)>, <2, (12, 3, 13)>, <2, (6, 14, 11)>, <2, (6, 14, 12)>, <2, (6, 11, 12)>, <2, (14, 11, 12)>, <2, (12, 3, 11)>, <2, (12, 3, 14)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (5, 7, 12)>, <3, (5, 7, 4)>, <3, (5, 12, 4)>, <3, (7, 12, 4)>

For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) as it has only two neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 0 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].
