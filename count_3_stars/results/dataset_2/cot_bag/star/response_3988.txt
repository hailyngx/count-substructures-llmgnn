Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors: node 5, node 9, and node 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
There are \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 5 neighbors of node 5. So, there are 10 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (9, 10, 14)>, <5, (6, 12, 10)>, <5, (6, 10, 14)>, <5, (12, 10, 14)>, <5, (10, 14, 9)>, <5, (14, 9, 8)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 13)>, <5, (4, 13, 1)>.

For node 9:
There are \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 6 neighbors of node 9. So, there are 20 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 10, 4)>, <9, (10, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 4)>, <9, (7, 4, 13)>, <9, (4, 13, 1)>, <9, (13, 1, 11)>, <9, (1, 11, 12)>, <9, (11, 12, 5)>, <9, (12, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <9, (10, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 12)>, <9, (7, 12, 11)>, <9, (12, 11, 13)>, <9, (11, 13, 6)>, <9, (13, 6, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 10)>, <9, (8, 10, 3)>.

For node 12:
There are \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 5 neighbors of node 12. So, there are 10 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (6, 11, 2)>, <12, (11, 0, 7)>, <12, (0, 2, 5)>, <12, (2, 6, 0)>, <12, (6, 5, 7)>, <12, (5, 7, 0)>, <12, (7, 0, 1)>, <12, (0, 1, 3)>, <12, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (3, 13, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 20 + 10] = [40] \).
