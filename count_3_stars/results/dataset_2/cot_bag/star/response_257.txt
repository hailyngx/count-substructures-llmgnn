Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 2, 9, 1, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (7, 1), (8, 4), (3, 4), (1, 4). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7), (6, 7), (9, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (4, 8), (2, 8), (9, 8), (5, 8), (3, 8). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (8, 5), (6, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (7, 6), (5, 6), (6, 5). No 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (7, 2), (8, 2), (5, 2), (3, 2), (2, 7). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (7, 9), (8, 9), (3, 9), (0, 9). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (4, 1), (7, 1), (5, 1), (0, 1). We can form 1 3-star with this node.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (4, 3), (8, 3), (2, 3), (9, 3), (0, 3). We can form 1 3-star with this node.

The total number of 3-stars is 8, so we have [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 1, 4)>
<7, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (4, 8, 3)>
<5, (8, 5, 1)>
<2, (7, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 9, 0)>
<1, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 3, 8)>
