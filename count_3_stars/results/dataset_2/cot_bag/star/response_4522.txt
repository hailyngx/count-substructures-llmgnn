Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 6, 7, and 9.

For node 6:
- There is 1 3-star formed with node 6 as the center: <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- Total number of 3-stars with node 6: 1

For node 7:
- There is 1 3-star formed with node 7 as the center: <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7: 1

For node 9:
- There are 4 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 1)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (1, 9, 4)>
- Total number of 3-stars with node 9: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 1)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (1, 9, 4)>.
