Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 10, 11, 12, 2, 6, 13, 9, 0, and 1.

For node 10:
- Combining with its 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6): [<10, (1, 3, 6)>]

For node 11:
- Combining with its 4 neighbors (0, 2, 12, 14): [<11, (0, 2, 12)>, <11, (0, 2, 14)>]

For node 12:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 10, 11): [<12, (4, 6, 7)>]

For node 2:
- Combining with its 4 neighbors (9, 11, 14): [<2, (9, 11, 14)>]

For node 6:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (3, 5, 10, 12, 13): [<6, (3, 5, 13)>]

For node 13:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 6, 10): [<13, (0, 1, 5)>]

For node 9:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8, 14): [<9, (0, 2, 8)>]

For node 0:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (1, 3, 9, 10, 13): [<0, (1, 3, 9)>]

For node 1:
- Combining with its 5 neighbors (0, 10, 13, 14, 8): [<1, (0, 10, 14)>]

There is a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the graph.
