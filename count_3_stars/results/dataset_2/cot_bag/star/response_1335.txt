Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 59\).

So, the final answer is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 0)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
