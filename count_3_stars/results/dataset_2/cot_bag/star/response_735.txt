Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 0) (26, 12) (1, 21) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 25) (21, 14) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 0) (23, 22) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 25) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 20) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 13) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (7, 18) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 12) (29, 9) (29, 24) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 2) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 5) (24, 2) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 14) (14, 21) (14, 20) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 13) (5, 7) (5, 24) (12, 26) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 27) (2, 24) (16, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 21, 0  
2: 27, 24  
3: 15, 11, 28  
4: 18, 0, 17  
5: 7, 24  
6: 21, 15, 28, 13  
7: 18, 25, 5, 17  
8: 15, 28, 20, 25  
9: 29, 0   
10: 11  
11: 3, 10, 24, 19  
12: 26, 25, 24, 13   
13: 18, 6, 0, 12  
14: 21, 20  
15: 3, 6, 8, 16  
16: 15  
17: 4, 19, 7  
18: 4, 27, 7, 13   
19: 11, 17, 20  
20: 8, 19, 14  
21: 1, 6, 25, 14  
22: 23, 27, 0   
23: 22  
24: 11, 29, 12, 5, 2  
25: 21, 8, 7, 12   
26: 12  
27: 22, 18, 2  
28: 3, 6, 8  
29: 9, 24

To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to each node that has three or more neighbors, and sum up the results.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
3: 15, 11, 28  
4: 18, 0, 17  
6: 21, 15, 28, 13  
7: 18, 25, 5, 17  
8: 15, 28, 20, 25   
11: 3, 10, 24, 19   
12: 26, 25, 24, 13   
13: 18, 6, 0, 12  
15: 3, 6, 8, 16  
17: 4, 19, 7   
18: 4, 27, 7, 13  
19: 11, 17, 20  
20: 8, 19, 14  
21: 1, 6, 25, 14  
24: 11, 29, 12, 5, 2  
25: 21, 8, 7, 12  
27: 22, 18, 2  
28: 3, 6, 8  
29: 9, 24

Now calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 15 \]

So, there are a total of 15 3-stars in this graph. We can list these unique 3-stars as follows:
\[  
<3, (15, 11, 28)> , \,  
<4, (18, 0, 17)> , \,  
<6, (21, 15, 28, 13)> , \,  
<7, (18, 25, 5, 17)> , \,  
<8, (15, 28, 20, 25)> , \,  
<11, (3, 10, 24, 19)> , \,  
<12, (26, 25, 24, 13)> , \,  
<13, (18, 6, 0, 12)> , \,  
<15, (3, 6, 8, 16)> , \,  
<17, (4, 19, 7)> , \,  
<18, (4, 27, 7, 13)> , \,  
<19, (11, 17, 20)> , \,   
<20, (8, 19, 14)> , \,  
<21, (1, 6, 25, 14)> , \,  
<24, (11, 29, 12, 5, 2)>  
\]
Putting it all together, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph.
