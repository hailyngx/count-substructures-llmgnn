Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 27) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 29) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (0, 6) (0, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 13) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 27) (19, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (26, 10) (26, 29) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 13) (11, 17) (11, 1) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 29) (29, 18) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 25) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 24) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 4) (25, 12) (25, 22) (25, 29) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 20) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 28) (28, 2) (28, 4) (28, 27) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 28) 

Response:
Let's go ahead and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 21, 3, 27): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 3): 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 4, 0): 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (10, 18, 11): 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (27, 3, 28): 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (17, 15, 20, 29): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (7, 24, 25): 1 3-star
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (6, 13): No 3-star
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors (23, 15): No 3-star
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (21): No 3-star
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors (1, 13): No 3-star
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (7, 22, 27, 23): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors (19, 24, 25): 1 3-star
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors (10, 29): No 3-star
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors (18, 14, 13): 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (16, 11, 13): 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors (17, 1): No 3-star
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors (10, 18, 23): 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors (5, 8, 29): 1 3-star
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors (18, 26, 21, 25): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (5, 9, 2): 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (0, 16, 15, 1, 24): [(5 choose 3) = 10] 3-stars
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors (12, 22, 13, 4): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors (12, 22, 29): 1 3-star
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors (14, 19, 20): 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 24, 28): 1 3-star
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 27): 1 3-star
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors (5, 2, 19, 28): [(4 choose 3) = 4] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, 9, 21>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 27>, <5, 21, 3>, <5, 21, 27>, <5, 3, 27>, <9, 6, 4>, <10, 17, 18>, <10, 17, 11>, <2, 27, 3>, <2, 27, 28>, <2, 3, 28>, <18, 15, 20>, <18, 15, 29>, <18, 20, 29>, <7, 12, 24>, <7, 12, 25>, <0, 6, 4>, <14, 15, 18>, <14, 15, 13>, <16, 1, 13>, <19, 22, 24>, <19, 22, 25>, <19, 23, 20>, <10, 18, 20>, <15, 14, 13>, <1, 16, 13>, <12, 22, 25>, <26, 29, 21>, <27, 19, 23>, <4, 24, 28>
