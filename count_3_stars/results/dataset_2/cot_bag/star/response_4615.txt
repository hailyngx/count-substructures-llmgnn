Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (27, 28) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 4) (20, 21) (20, 3) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (14, 7) (14, 21) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 18) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 18) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 1) (8, 27) (8, 6) (8, 15) (8, 21) (10, 0) (10, 25) (12, 26) (12, 19) (4, 29) (4, 13) (4, 15) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 24) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 15) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 28) (19, 7) (19, 12) (28, 27) (28, 17) (28, 23) (21, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (3, 9) (3, 20) (3, 16) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 18) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 15 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 16 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 22 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 23 forms 3 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes above, we get a total of [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 10)>
<2, (25, 4, 29)>
<4, (29, 13, 15)>
<5, (9, 6, 23)>
<7, (0, 14, 13)>
<8, (6, 15, 21)>
<13, (4, 18, 23)>
<15, (11, 8, 22)>
<16, (3, 26, 18)>
<18, (17, 16, 24)>
<22, (24, 17, 15)>
<23, (28, 7, 13)>
