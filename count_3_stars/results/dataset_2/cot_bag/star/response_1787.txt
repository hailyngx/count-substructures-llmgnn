Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify these nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of them.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 3-stars = $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
- Node 1: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 2: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 3: 3-stars = $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10
- Node 4: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 5: 3-stars = $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10
- Node 6: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 7: 3-stars = $\binom{6}{3}$ = 20
- Node 8: 3-stars = $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10
- Node 9: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 10: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 11: 3-stars = $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
- Node 13: 3-stars = $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 12)>
<2, (1, 7, 13)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<4, (5, 6, 13)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 13)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 10)>
<10, (6, 8, 9)>
<13, (2, 4, 9)>
