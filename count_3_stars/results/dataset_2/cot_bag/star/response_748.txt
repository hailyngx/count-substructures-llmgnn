Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given list of edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<0, (8, 3, 5)>
<0, (8, 3, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 0, 6)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
