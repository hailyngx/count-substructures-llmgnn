Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can have the following degrees:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 5
Node 11: 2
Node 12: 2
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 4
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 2
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 4

Let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 3 3-stars
Node 6:  1 3-star
Node 7: 7 3-stars
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star
Node 10: 7 3-stars
Node 15: 2 3-stars
Node 16: 1 3-star
Node 18: 1 3-star
Node 19: 2 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, 15, 5>
<3, 16, 18>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 12, 19>
<6, 1, 7>
<7, 10, 19>
<7, 15, 5>
<7, 3, 18>
<10, 7, 19>
<15, 2, 4>
<15, 5, 12>
<16, 3, 4>
<18, 3, 16>
<19, 9, 12>
<19, 10, 7>
