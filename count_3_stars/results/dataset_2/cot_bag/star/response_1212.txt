Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (15, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 16) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 18) (21, 24) (21, 0) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 14) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 25) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 2) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 20) (28, 24) (22, 27) (22, 20) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 29) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 25) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 3) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 25) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 16) (8, 0) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 29) (25, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 13, 16, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = [[56]]
