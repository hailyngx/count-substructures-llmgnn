Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 0, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 2, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 1, 5)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>
