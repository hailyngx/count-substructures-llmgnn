Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 3, 0}
- Node 2: {9, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 2, 1, 0}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 9, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, and <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
