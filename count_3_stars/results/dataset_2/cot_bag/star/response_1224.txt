Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 9 have 7 neighbors each.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
  
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ [35 + 10 + 4] = [49] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
