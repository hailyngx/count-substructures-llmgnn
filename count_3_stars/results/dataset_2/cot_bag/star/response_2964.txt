Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

1: 5, 3, 4, 8
2: 5, 4, 8, 0
3: 5, 9, 1, 4, 8
4: 6, 1, 3, 2, 0
5: 6, 2, 1, 3
6: 5, 9, 4, 0
7: 0, 8
8: 1, 3, 7, 2
9: 6, 3, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
