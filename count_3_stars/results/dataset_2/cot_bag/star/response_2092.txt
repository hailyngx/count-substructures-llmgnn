Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 6) (8, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 7) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 2) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 53

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars are:
