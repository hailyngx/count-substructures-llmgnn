Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 2)>
- <6, (1, 0, 4)>
- <6, (1, 0, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 1)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (6, 1, 4)>
- <8, (9, 3, 1)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
