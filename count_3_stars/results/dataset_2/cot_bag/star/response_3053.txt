Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors in the graph are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
