Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph:

```
            7
           /|\
          4 1 8
         /|  | |\
        3 2--0--9
         /|   | /
        6 5---8
```

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 60 3-stars.

So, the answer is [60].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
