Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5 ,9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
