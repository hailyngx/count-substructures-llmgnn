Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

For node 0:
It has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 9.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<0, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 1:
It has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 7.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 2:
It has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9.
Since node 2 has less than 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars with node 2.

For node 3:
It has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, and 9.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
It has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

For nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
Since they each have 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with each of these nodes is 4.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 5(4) = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].
