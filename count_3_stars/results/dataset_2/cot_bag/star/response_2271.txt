Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 6. 

For Node 1:
The 3-stars formed with Node 1 are:
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>

For Node 3:
The 3-stars formed with Node 3 are:
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>

For Node 6:
The 3-stars formed with Node 6 are:
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
