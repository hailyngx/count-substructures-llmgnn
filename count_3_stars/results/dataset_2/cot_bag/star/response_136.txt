Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (27, 24) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 22) (10, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 1) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 6) (21, 8) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 7) (16, 1) (29, 9) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 18) (2, 17) (22, 25) (22, 28) (22, 19) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (3, 0) (3, 17) (7, 28) (7, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 3) (17, 8) (15, 26) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 24) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 14) (8, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 9, 26, 0, 27, 20, 25, 10, 11, 5, 6, 21, 28, 23, 22, 24, 17, 15, 18, 4, 13, 8, 14, and 12. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
13. Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
14. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
16. Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
17. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
19. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
20. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
21. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
22. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
23. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 89 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [89].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, 14, 12>, <9, 14, 29>, <9, 14, 12>, <9, 14, 29>, <26, 8, 15>, <0, 10, 3>, <27, 24, 13>, <20, 5, 18>, <20, 25, 22>, <20, 25, 23>, <20, 25, 13>, <25, 13, 19>, <25, 13, 10>, <25, 13, 14>, <25, 13, 27>, <10, 0, 3>, <10, 0, 11>, <10, 0, 6>, <10, 0, 13>, <10, 1...
