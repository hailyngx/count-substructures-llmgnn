Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: does not have enough neighbors
- Node 8: does not have enough neighbors
- Node 9: does not have enough neighbors

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, there are 46 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [46].
