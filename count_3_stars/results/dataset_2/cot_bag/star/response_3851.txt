Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {6, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 3: {9, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 and Node 4 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 6 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Summing these up, we have \( 2 \times 10 + 4 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 = 40 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
