Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors, let's identify those nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars from each:

- Node 2: It has neighbors 22, 18, 8, and 20. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: It has neighbors 2, 8, 26, 9, and 10. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has neighbors 6, 27, and 1. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: It has neighbors 2, 28, and 20. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12: It has neighbors 28, 10, 17, and 0. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: It has neighbors 22, 25, and 1. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19: It has neighbors 23, 29, and 14. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22: It has neighbors 13, 23, 9, and 2. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25: It has neighbors 13, 3, 7, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27: It has neighbors 3, 19, 28, 4, and 16. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28: It has neighbors 8, 11, 17, 12, and 27. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<2, (22, 8, 20)>, <20, (2, 8, 26)>, <4, (6, 27, 1)>, <8, (2, 28, 20)>, <12, (28, 10, 17)>, <13, (22, 25, 1)>, <19, (23, 29, 14)>, <22, (13, 23, 9)>, <25, (13, 3, 7)>, <27, (3, 19, 28)>, <28, (8, 11, 17)>
