Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4 and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-star graphs can be formed with node 4.

For node 3:
\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs can be formed with node 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \). 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (8, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (8, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 7)>
<4, (8, 7, 3)>
<4, (3, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 2)>
<4, (8, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 8, 3)>
<4, (8, 3, 2)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 3)>
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<4, (3, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 8, 4)>
<3, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (9, 7, 4)>
<3, (9, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
