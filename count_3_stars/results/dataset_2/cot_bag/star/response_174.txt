Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 28) (4, 7) (4, 23) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 28) (7, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 9) (27, 20) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 0) (25, 20) (2, 10) (2, 20) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 29) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 17) (1, 22) (1, 5) (1, 19) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 9) (28, 16) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 12) (26, 23) (26, 5) (5, 1) (5, 26) (21, 16) (21, 29) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 24) (6, 29) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 24) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 18) (18, 14) (18, 29) (18, 13) (24, 17) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 13) (13, 7) (13, 29) (13, 18) (13, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

2. For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

3. For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

5. For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

6. For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

7. For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

8. For node 12: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

9. For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

10. For node 16: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

11. For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

12. For node 20: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

13. For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

14. For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

15. For node 25: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

16. For node 26: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)

17. For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

18. For node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes:

\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 63 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [63]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (25, 20, 27)>
<1, (19, 24, 17)>
<2, (10, 8, 20)>
<7, (9, 13, 28)>
<9, (22, 11, 0)>
<10, (2, 19, 11)>
<11, (8, 10, 23)>
<13, (18, 29, 24)>
<16, (21, 7, 28)>
<19, (1, 24, 19)>
<20, (25, 2, 27)>
<23, (4, 12, 11)>
<24, (19, 12, 17)>
<25, (20, 0, 2)>
<26, (5, 1, 23)>
<28, (7, 16, 9)>
<29, (6, 13, 18)>
