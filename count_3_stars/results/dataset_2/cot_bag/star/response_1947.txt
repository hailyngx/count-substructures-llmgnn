Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 25) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 16) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 14) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 29) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 8) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 18) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 29) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 27) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 19) (0, 1) (0, 8) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 29) (19, 27) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 19) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 15, 26, 25, 10, 17, 7, 12, 5, 8, 28, 22, 19, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
3. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
4. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
8. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
11. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get:

\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 56 \)

Hence, inside brackets [] we have 56 3-stars.
