Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 7) (13, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 8, 10, 3
- Node 1: 9, 8, 5, 12
- Node 2: 6, 7, 5, 14
- Node 3: 4, 7, 13, 0, 12, 10
- Node 4: 7, 8, 12, 10, 11, 3
- Node 5: 8, 2, 1, 11
- Node 6: 14, 2
- Node 7: 4, 3, 10, 2, 13
- Node 8: 9, 4, 5, 0, 1
- Node 9: 1, 8
- Node 10: 4, 7, 0, 12, 3
- Node 11: 4, 5, 14
- Node 12: 4, 10, 14, 3, 1
- Node 13: 7, 3
- Node 14: 6, 12, 11, 2

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 3, 4, 7, 8, 1, 12, 10, and 5.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up: 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (4, 7, 10)>
- <4, (3, 7, 10)>
- <7, (3, 4, 10)>
- <8, (1, 9, 5)>
- <1, (8, 9, 5)>
- <12, (4, 10, 14)>
- <10, (4, 7, 12)>
- <5, (8, 1, 11)>
