Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the following 3-star graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 2, 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 13, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 1, 13, 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 5, 11
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 12, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 11, 10, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 0, 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 11, 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 8
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 3, 14
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 1, 13, 0
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 2, 12
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 13

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. The unique 3-stars are represented as follows: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 1, 13>, <3, 7, 11>, <4, 0, 10>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 7, 12>, <7, 10, 11>, <8, 0, 6>, <9, 2, 6>, <10, 4, 7>, <11, 3, 14>, <12, 0, 6>.
