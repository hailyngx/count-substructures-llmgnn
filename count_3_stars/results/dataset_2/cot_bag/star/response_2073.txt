Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (8, 7, 11)>
<2, (0, 10, 12)>
<4, (5, 9, 13)>
<6, (8, 1, 7)>
<8, (13, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<10, (13, 14, 2)>
<12, (13, 14, 2)>
<13, (9, 8, 7)>
<14, (9, 12, 5)>
