Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 16) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (3, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 19) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (7, 11) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 7) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 14, 17, 3, 18, 8, 13, 6, 2, 4, 9, 11, 10, 16, 5, 12, 19, 1, 0.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, therefore there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 17 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 18 as the center.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 13 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 11 as the center.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 10 as the center.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 16 as the center.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 19 as the center.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<14, (17, 0, 1)>, 
<17, (14, 3, 16)>, 
<3, (14, 15, 18)>, 
<18, (14, 6, 3)>, 
<8, (13, 2, 11)>, 
<13, (17, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (13, 19, 18)>, 
<2, (8, 4, 11)>, 
<9, (18, 11, 10)>, 
<11, (8, 2, 7)>, 
<10, (9, 15, 1)>, 
<16, (17, 19, 5)>, 
<19, (3, 12, 16)>, 
<1, (0, 10, 14)>.
