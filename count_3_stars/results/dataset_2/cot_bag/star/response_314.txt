Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 7, node 13, and node 14. Let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed with each of these nodes:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 1, 3
- Total number of 3-stars with node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (8, 12, 1)>, <4, (8, 12, 3)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (12, 1, 3)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 10, 13, 1
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (10, 13, 1)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 7, 5, 11, 3, 0
- Total number of 3-stars with node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 13 as the center: <13, (7, 5, 11)>, <13, (7, 5, 3)>, <13, (7, 5, 0)>, <13, (7, 11, 3)>, <13, (7, 11, 0)>, <13, (7, 3, 0)>, <13, (5, 11, 3)>, <13, (5, 11, 0)>, <13, (5, 3, 0)>, <13, (11, 3, 0)>

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 9, 12, 11, 1, 10
- Total number of 3-stars with node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 14 as the center: <14, (9, 12, 11)>, <14, (9, 12, 1)>, <14, (9, 12, 10)>, <14, (9, 11, 1)>, <14, (9, 11, 10)>, <14, (9, 1, 10)>, <14, (12, 11, 1)>, <14, (12, 11, 10)>, <14, (12, 1, 10)>, <14, (11, 1, 10)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25]. The unique 3-stars are: <4, (8, 12, 1)>, <4, (8, 12, 3)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (12, 1, 3)>, <7, (10, 13, 1)>, <13, (7, 5, 11)>, <13, (7, 5, 3)>, <13, (7, 5, 0)>, <13, (7, 11, 3)>, <13, (7, 11, 0)>, <13, (7, 3, 0)>, <13, (5, 11, 3)>, <13, (5, 11, 0)>, <13, (5, 3, 0)>, <13, (11, 3, 0)>, <14, (9, 12, 11)>, <14, (9, 12, 1)>, <14, (9, 12, 10)>, <14, (9, 11, 1)>, <14, (9, 11, 10)>, <14, (9, 1, 10)>, <14, (12, 11, 1)>, <14, (12, 11, 10)>, <14, (12, 1, 10)>, <14, (11, 1, 10)>
