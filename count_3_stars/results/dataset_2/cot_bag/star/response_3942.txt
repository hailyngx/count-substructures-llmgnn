Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

Node 3 has exactly 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has exactly 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
