Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 10, 4)>
<1, (0, 10, 7)>
<2, (0, 12, 1)>
<3, (9, 10, 6)>
<4, (10, 11, 13)>
<6, (0, 10, 7)>
<10, (0, 4, 6)>
<11, (1, 4, 13)>
<13, (4, 8, 11)>
<14, (6, 12, 9)>
