Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the central nodes that have three or more neighbors. These central nodes are 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 2, 12, 11, 14, and 10.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:
1. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8. Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
9. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 66 3-stars: \[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 66.
Inside brackets [], we have [66].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 11, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 10)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<8, (13, 11, 6)>
<13, (7, 8, 10)>
<2, (8, 5, 9)>
<11, (4, 8, 13)>
<14, (4, 10, 9)>
<10, (7, 1, 13)>
