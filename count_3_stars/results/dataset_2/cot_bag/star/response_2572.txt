Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 29) (25, 22) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 1) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 26) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 1) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 13) (12, 0) (12, 19) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 24) (8, 6) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (19, 12) (19, 2) (27, 17) (27, 10) (26, 20) (26, 4) (26, 5) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 18) (3, 24) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 16) (23, 5) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 18) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (22, 25) (22, 15) (22, 8) (11, 9) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with degree 3 or more, which could potentially form 3-stars. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 5
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 18 has degree 5
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 28 has degree 4
- Node 29 has degree 3

We will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using these nodes based on the explanation in the instruction. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.
