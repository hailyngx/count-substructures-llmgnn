Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 13, 3, 11, 9, 0, 10, 1, 14, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 90 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [90].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<13, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 2, 14)>
<0, (11, 10, 12)>
<10, (2, 3, 12)>
<1, (4, 8, 13)>
<14, (4, 7, 6)>
<12, (9, 0, 10)>
