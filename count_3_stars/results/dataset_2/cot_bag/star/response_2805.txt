Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with the highest degree are 5, 9, 4, 0, 10, 11, 6, 3, 8, 13, 7, 14, 2, 1 with degrees 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, and 3, respectively. 

We identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 0, 10, 11, 6, 3, 8, 13, 7, 14.

Now we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors --> [1 3-star] = [1]
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors --> [1 3-star] = [1]
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 10: has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 11: has 6 neighbors --> [inom{6}{3}] = [20]
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors --> [1 3-star] = [1]
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors --> no 3-star
- Node 13: has 3 neighbors --> no 3-star
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors --> no 3-star
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors --> [1 3-star] = [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [54]

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<5, 9, 0, 8>, <4, 5, 8, 12>, <0, 10, 11, 3>, <11, 6, 4, 13>, <3, 2, 14, 1>  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].
