Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 4, 7, 5, 13, 0, 8, 6, 10, 11, 14, 12, and 2. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 72 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 

Some unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<4, (7, 0, 13)>
<7, (0, 6, 4)>
<5, (10, 11, 13)>
<13, (2, 12, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (9, 1, 14)>
<6, (2, 12, 7)>
<10, (11, 12, 14)>
<11, (10, 14, 5)>
<14, (1, 11, 8)>
<12, (3, 10, 13)>
<2, (3, 6, 14)>
