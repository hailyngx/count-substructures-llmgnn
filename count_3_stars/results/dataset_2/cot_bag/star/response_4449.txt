Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (17, 13) (19, 16) (19, 14) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (3, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 7, 12, 2, 14, 5, 13, 1, 0, 6, 15, 10, and 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 41 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

Some of the unique 3-stars are: 
<11, 1, 4>
<16, 1, 15>
<7, 5, 2>
<12, 7, 15>
<2, 12, 14>
<14, 2, 0>
<5, 13, 16>
<13, 17, 5>
<1, 11, 16>
<0, 14, 2>
<6, 7, 14>
<15, 6, 7>
<10, 1, 4>
