Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 13. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (5, 0, 9, 4, 14) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (9, 1, 8) -> 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (9, 2, 8) -> 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7, 13, 12, 10) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (9, 4, 7, 12, 3) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0, 7, 14) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (5, 7, 1, 11, 12) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: (5, 4, 3, 6, 14, 13) -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (9, 13, 2, 10) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (2, 1, 0, 12, 10) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (8, 2, 3, 10) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (7, 8, 11, 3) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Now summing up the 3-stars formed by each node: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of 74 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 9, 4, 14>, <3, 4, 7, 12>, <5, 6, 0, 7>, <5, 7, 13, 14>, <6, 5, 7, 12>, <7, 8, 13, 11>
