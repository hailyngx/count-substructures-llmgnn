Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can construct the graph and identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 120 = 158 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [158].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
