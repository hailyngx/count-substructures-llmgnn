Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 1) (13, 23) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 1) (22, 21) (23, 13) (23, 4) (0, 16) (0, 24) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 16) (9, 4) (9, 14) (29, 24) (4, 23) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 5) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 25) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 19) (25, 12) (25, 28) (25, 19) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (10, 1) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 10) (14, 9) (14, 27) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 20) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 11) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 14) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 4) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 10) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 10) (18, 28) (18, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 13, 22, 15, 10
- Node 3: neighbors 5, 26, 19, 28
- Node 4: neighbors 9, 23, 12, 21
- Node 10: neighbors 1, 26, 16, 24, 7
- Node 12: neighbors 4, 15, 25
- Node 15: neighbors 1, 6, 12, 16
- Node 16: neighbors 0, 6, 15, 7
- Node 19: neighbors 20, 3, 17, 25, 11
- Node 22: neighbors 13, 27, 1, 21
- Node 24: neighbors 0, 29, 10
- Node 26: neighbors 20, 3, 10
- Node 28: neighbors 3, 17, 18, 25

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- For nodes 1, 3, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 26, and 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 0: Less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (13, 22, 15)>
<3, (5, 26, 19)>
<4, (9, 23, 12)>
<10, (1, 26, 16)>
<12, (4, 15, 25)>
<15, (1, 6, 12)>
<16, (0, 6, 15)>
<19, (20, 3, 17)>
<22, (13, 27, 1)>
<26, (20, 3, 10)>
<28, (3, 17, 18)>
