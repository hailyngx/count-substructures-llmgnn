Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <5, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (7, 8, 2)>

- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <9, (6, 8, 0)>

- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (1, 7, 4)>
  - <4, (1, 8, 7)>
  - <4, (7, 8, 1)>

- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (3, 4, 1)>
  - <7, (3, 1, 2)>
  - <7, (3, 1, 8)>
  - <7, (3, 2, 1)>
  - <7, (3, 2, 8)>
     ...
  - (Total of 20 unique 3-stars)

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
     ...
  - (Total of 10 unique 3-stars)

- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
  - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
     ...
  - (Total of 10 unique 3-stars)

- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <6, (0, 7, 9)>

- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 7, 4)>
     ...
  - (Total of 10 unique 3-stars)

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <0, (3, 6, 9)>

- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated:
\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [62] \]

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 62.
