Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 17) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 15) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 14) (19, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19. So, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48 \) 3-stars. 

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have: \[ [48]. \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (6, 9, 14)>
- <1, (6, 15, 2)>
- <3, (1, 5, 15)>
- <4, (7, 12, 13)>
- <5, (3, 16, 18)>
- <6, (0, 1, 14)>
- <7, (4, 8, 12)>
- <8, (7, 13, 17)>
- <9, (0, 1, 15)>
- <10, (0, 12, 19)>
- <12, (4, 7, 19)>
- <13, (4, 7, 19)>
- <14, (0, 6, 16)>
- <15, (1, 2, 9)>
- <16, (0, 5, 19)>
- <17, (8, 19, 13)>
- <19, (12, 13, 16)>
