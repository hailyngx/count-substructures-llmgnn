Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 19) (3, 12) (11, 7) (5, 12) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 15) (4, 17) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (16, 1) (16, 6) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will check each node and see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 1, 15, 19. There are 1 3-star with node 0: <0, (2, 1, 15)>.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 16. There are 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (0, 6, 16)>.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 0, 9, 13. There are 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (8, 0, 13)>.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 13, 15, 17. There are 1 3-star with node 4: <4, (13, 15, 17)>.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 16, 17. There are 1 3-star with node 6: <6, (1, 16, 17)>.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 11, 19, 9, 17. There are 1 3-star with node 7: <7, (11, 19, 17)>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 14. There are 1 3-star with node 9: <9, (2, 7, 14)>.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 19, 18, 14. There are 1 3-star with node 10: <10, (19, 18, 14)>.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 17, 15. There are 1 3-star with node 12: <12, (3, 5, 17)>.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 14. There are 1 3-star with node 13: <13, (2, 4, 14)>.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 13, 9, 10. There are 1 3-star with node 14: <14, (13, 9, 10)>.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 12, 18. There are 1 3-star with node 15: <15, (0, 4, 12)>.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 1, 6. Node 16 cannot form a 3-star.
Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 8, 4, 12, 6, 7. There are 1 3-star with node 17: <17, (8, 4, 12)>.
Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 15, 10. Node 18 cannot form a 3-star.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 15, 10. There are 1 3-star with node 19: <19, (0, 7, 15)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
