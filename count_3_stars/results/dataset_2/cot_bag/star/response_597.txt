Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are seven nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are 4 neighboring nodes (1, 3, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are 4 neighboring nodes (4, 6, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are 5 neighboring nodes (0, 1, 5, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 5 neighboring nodes (2, 6, 8, 9, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are 3 neighboring nodes (1, 3, 8), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 7, there are 4 neighboring nodes (0, 2, 3, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are 5 neighboring nodes (2, 4, 5, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 43

Thus, there are a total of 43 3-stars in the given graph.
