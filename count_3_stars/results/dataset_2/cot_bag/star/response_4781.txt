Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 3
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 2
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 1, 3
- Node 3: 9, 4, 0, 7, 2
- Node 4: 8, 0, 3, 1
- Node 5: 6, 2, 1, 7
- Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 0
- Node 7: 5, 8, 0, 3, 2
- Node 8: 9, 4, 7
- Node 9: 8, 3

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars based on the nodes' neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5, 7>
