Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 5, 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 4, 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 10, 7, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 14, 2, 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 3, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 8, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 0, 2, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 2, 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 1, 7, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 3, 12, 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 11, 0, 1.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 4, 5.

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 \]
\[ = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (7, 1, 5)>, <1, (9, 0, 12)>, <2, (8, 6, 4)>, <4, (6, 11, 14)>, <5, (0, 14, 3)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 10)>, <9, (8, 14, 1)>, <12, (9, 13, 11)>, <14, (9, 13, 4)>
