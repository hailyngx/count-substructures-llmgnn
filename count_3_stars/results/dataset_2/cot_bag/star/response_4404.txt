Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 5 neighbors (node 5, 9, and 8) and 3 nodes with 4 neighbors (node 4, 7, and 0). We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For the nodes with 5 neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For the nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 4: There is only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 7: There is only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- Node 0: There are no 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 9) + 10 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 7) = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 0, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>
