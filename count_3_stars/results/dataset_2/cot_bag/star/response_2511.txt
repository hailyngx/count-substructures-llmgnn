Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, node 4, and node 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars connected to node 1.

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 3-stars connected to node 2.

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars connected to node 4.

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars connected to node 8.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22\).

Therefore, the final answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 11)>
<1, (0, 4, 12)>
<1, (5, 4, 10)>
<1, (5, 4, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 13)>
<2, (8, 9, 13)>
<2, (10, 9, 13)>
<2, (11, 9, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 10)>
<4, (1, 5, 14)>
<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<8, (9, 11, 2)>
<8, (9, 13, 2)>
<8, (11, 13, 2)>
<8, (11, 13, 8)>
<8, (13, 2, 8)>
