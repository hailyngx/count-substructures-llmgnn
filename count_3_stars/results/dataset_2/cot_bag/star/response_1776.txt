Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 3, 4, 19, 16, 17, 9, 0, 15, 2, 13, 12, 10, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36

Thus, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
