Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars: \( 6 \times 10 + 2 \times 4 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
