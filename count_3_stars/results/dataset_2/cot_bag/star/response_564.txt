Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 22) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 11) (11, 5) (11, 22) (28, 3) (28, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 2) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 0) (10, 18) (2, 22) (2, 0) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 28) (3, 16) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 25) (19, 24) (29, 27) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 1) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 13) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 13) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 12) (13, 23) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 24) (25, 18) (17, 4) (17, 23) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 25) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
- Node 0 with neighbors: 9, 7, 16, 2  
- Node 3 with neighbors: 9, 4, 28, 16  
- Node 4 with neighbors: 26, 8, 17, 3  
- Node 5 with neighbors: 6, 12, 11  
- Node 8 with neighbors: 4, 14, 25, 22  
- Node 13 with neighbors: 15, 16, 24, 12, 23  
- Node 14 with neighbors: 8, 22, 1  
- Node 15 with neighbors: 27, 20, 13  
- Node 16 with neighbors: 0, 3, 24, 13  
- Node 20 with neighbors: 26, 15, 27, 12  
- Node 22 with neighbors: 26, 8, 2, 14, 11  
- Node 24 with neighbors: 16, 13, 19, 25  
- Node 25 with neighbors: 8, 1, 24, 18  
- Node 26 with neighbors: 9, 22, 20, 4  
- Node 27 with neighbors: 15, 29, 18, 20, 7  

Now, we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 22: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 25: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
- Node 27: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is [4+4+4+1+4+10+1+1+4+4+10+4+4+4+10] = 65  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (9, 7, 16)>  
<3, (9, 4, 28)>  
<4, (26, 8, 17)>  
<5, (6, 12, 11)>  
<13, (15, 24, 23)>  
<14, (8, 22, 1)>  
<15, (27, 20, 13)>  
<16, (0, 24, 13)>  
<20, (26, 27, 12)>  
<22, (8, 14, 11)>  
<24, (16, 19, 25)>  
<25, (8, 1, 18)>  
<26, (22, 20, 4)>  
<27, (15, 29, 18)>
