Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 15) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 17) (1, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 4) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 5) (10, 14) (10, 18) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 15, 14, 17, and 13.

For node 3:
- The number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- <3, (15, 0, 16)>, <3, (0, 15, 16)>, <3, (15, 9, 0)>, <3, (15, 9, 16)>

For node 15:
- The number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- <15, (3, 0, 16)>, <15, (3, 0, 4)>, <15, (3, 7, 0)>, <15, (3, 7, 4)>

For node 14:
- The number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <14, (17, 18, 13)>

For node 17:
- The number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <17, (14, 1, 12)>

For node 13:
- The number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- <13, (14, 8, 12)>, <13, (14, 12, 16)>, <13, (8, 12, 16)>, <13, (8, 12, 9)>

Adding all the 3-stars, we have a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [14].

So, the unique 3-stars found are: <3, (15, 0, 16)>, <3, (0, 15, 16)>, <3, (15, 9, 0)>, <3, (15, 9, 16)>, <15, (3, 0, 16)>, <15, (3, 0, 4)>, <15, (3, 7, 0)>, <15, (3, 7, 4)>, <14, (17, 18, 13)>, <17, (14, 1, 12)>, <13, (14, 8, 12)>, <13, (14, 12, 16)>, <13, (8, 12, 16)>, <13, (8, 12, 9)>.
