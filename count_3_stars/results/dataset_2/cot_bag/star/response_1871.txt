Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 25) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 29) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 8) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 23) (5, 23) (5, 27) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 16) (29, 21) (0, 3) (0, 22) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 28) (23, 5) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 7) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 24) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 21) (21, 29) (21, 4) (21, 22) (27, 5) (27, 8) (24, 19) (24, 15) (24, 10) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 22) (22, 0) (22, 21) (22, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of a given node, we can find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 3 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
3. Node 4 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 6 (with 2 neighbors): 0 3-stars
5. Node 7 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
6. Node 9 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 12 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 13 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 15 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 16 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
11. Node 17 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
12. Node 18 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
13. Node 20 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 21 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
15. Node 22 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
16. Node 23 (with 4 neighbors): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17. Node 24 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
18. Node 25 (with 3 neighbors): 1 3-star
19. Node 26 (with 2 neighbors): 0 3-stars
20. Node 28 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
21. Node 29 (with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get 59 3-stars in total. 
So, the final number of 3-stars is [59].
