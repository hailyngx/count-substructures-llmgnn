Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors. Since it does not have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<Node 8, (10, 11, 12)>, <Node 8, (0, 11, 12)>, <Node 8, (0, 11, 13)>, <Node 8, (0, 12, 13)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors. Since it does not have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 10 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<Node 10, (5, 7, 8)>, <Node 10, (5, 8, 11)>, <Node 10, (7, 8, 11)>, <Node 10, (11, 12, 13)>
