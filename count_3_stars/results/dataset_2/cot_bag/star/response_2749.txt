Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 2) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 4) (0, 26) (20, 29) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 23) (17, 27) (17, 4) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 25) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 18) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 16) (19, 3) (10, 15) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 16) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 0) (26, 10) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 25) (9, 13) (25, 11) (25, 18) (25, 9) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (2, 1) (2, 25) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 13) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 24) (21, 5) (21, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 24) (23, 29) (23, 27) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 23) 

Response:
Applying the criteria mentioned earlier, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 16 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 3 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 2 neighbors.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is 18, so we have [18] 3-stars in total. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (18, 4, 25)>, <4, (18, 3, 16)>, <4, (18, 3, 25)>, <6, (28, 7, 22)>, <6, (28, 13, 24)>, <13, (6, 10, 9)>, <13, (6, 24, 14)>, <16, (5, 18, 10)>, <16, (5, 12, 10)>, <16, (5, 12, 6)>, <18, (3, 4, 16)>, <25, (11, 2, 9)>, <29, (20, 23, 28)>, <29, (20, 23, 6)>.
