Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 4) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (13, 26) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 17) (16, 20) (16, 12) (16, 28) (16, 19) (15, 5) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 29) (18, 20) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 24) (2, 7) (2, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.

Summing up these results: 
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Thus, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in the given graph.
