Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 16) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 11 and node 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 11: Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 11 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars involving node 11 are:

<11, (9, 13, 17)>
<11, (7, 9, 17)>
<11, (7, 13, 17)>
<11, (9, 13, 16)>
<11, (7, 9, 16)>
<11, (7, 13, 16)>
<11, (9, 13, 16)>
<11, (7, 9, 16)>
<11, (7, 13, 16)>
<11, (9, 13, 16)>

For node 13: Node 13 also has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 13 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars involving node 13 are:

<13, (9, 19, 18)>
<13, (2, 19, 18)>
<13, (2, 9, 18)>
<13, (4, 19, 18)>
<13, (4, 2, 18)>
<13, (4, 9, 18)>
<13, (2, 4, 18)>
<13, (2, 9, 18)>
<13, (2, 4, 18)>
<13, (4, 9, 18)>

Adding up the 3-stars, we get a total of \(10 + 10 = 20\). So, the total number of 3-stars is [20].
