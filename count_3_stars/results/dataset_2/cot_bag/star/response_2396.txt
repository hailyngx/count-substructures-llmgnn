Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 70 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 70, represented as `[70]`.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 10, 14)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 13)>, 
<2, (0, 11, 14)>, 
<3, (1, 11, 8)>, 
<4, (8, 12, 14)>, 
<5, (0, 13, 1)>, 
<6, (1, 11, 2)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 10)>, 
<8, (4, 3, 12)>, 
<9, (11, 1, 6)>, 
<10, (0, 7, 14)>, 
<12, (7, 8, 3)>, 
<13, (1, 5, 0)>, 
<14, (2, 10, 4)>.
