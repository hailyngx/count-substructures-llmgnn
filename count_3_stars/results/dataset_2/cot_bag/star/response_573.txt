Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 14, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 11, 9, 0
- Node 2: 14, 13
- Node 3: 10, 6, 5, 8
- Node 4: 13, 5, 14, 1
- Node 5: 4, 7, 3, 0, 10
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9, 14, 0
- Node 7: 11, 10, 14, 5
- Node 8: 3, 9, 0
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8, 10, 12
- Node 10: 7, 3, 9, 12, 5
- Node 11: 7, 1, 12
- Node 12: 9, 10, 11
- Node 13: 4, 2
- Node 14: 4, 7, 6, 0, 2

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <0, (1, 6, 14)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <3, (6, 8, 10)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <4, (5, 13, 14)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <5, (0, 4, 10)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <7, (5, 10, 14)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <9, (1, 6, 10)>
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <10, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
    - <14, (0, 4, 7)>

Adding up the 3-stars found, we have a total of [72] unique 3-stars in the graph.
