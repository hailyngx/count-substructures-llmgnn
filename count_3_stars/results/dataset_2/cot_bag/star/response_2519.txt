Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 4, 7, 2, 3, 1
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 0
- Node 2: 9, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 6, 2, 0
- Node 4: 5, 8, 0
- Node 5: 9, 1, 4, 3
- Node 6: 7, 3, 8, 0
- Node 7: 6, 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 7, 1
- Node 9: 5, 8, 2

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)

So, there are 46 3-stars in the given graph. 

This can be represented as:
[46]

and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 1)>
<0, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<0, (2, 3, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<0, (3, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
