Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center:

Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>)
Node 1: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars (Total: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>)
Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>)
Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>)
Node 5: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 1)>, <5, (3, 8, 1)>)
Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>)
Node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>)
Node 9: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars (Total: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>)

Adding all the identified unique 3-stars, we get a total of [34] 3-stars.
