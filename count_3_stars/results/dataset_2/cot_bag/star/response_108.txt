Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, let's first analyze each node to see how many neighbors it has:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors (7, 3, 8, 5, 6)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 6, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (4, 1, 3, 8)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 0, 9, 2)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (8, 6, 2)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 6)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 5, 0)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 6, 9, 8, 4)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 2, 0)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (7, 3)

Based on the analysis above, we can now calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58 \)

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
