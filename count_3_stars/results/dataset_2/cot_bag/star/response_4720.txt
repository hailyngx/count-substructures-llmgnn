The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 16) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 4) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 22) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 29) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 29) (28, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 10) (17, 18) (17, 13) (23, 16) (23, 29) (23, 21) (1, 27) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 20) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 20) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 16) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 13) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 25) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (8, 11) (8, 5) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 24) (4, 3) (24, 20) (24, 22) (24, 21) (16, 9) (16, 23) (16, 5) (22, 7) (22, 24) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 24) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 23) 

Response:
Considering the given information, we can construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges as described. Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 26 has 4 neighbors including nodes 18, 5, 10, and 15. So, a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed around node 26. 

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors including nodes 26, 3, 13, and 11. Similarly, a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed around node 15.

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors including nodes 0, 7, 1, and 19. Therefore, a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed around node 14.

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors including nodes 15, 28, 8, and 29. So, a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed around node 11.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we get the total number of 3-stars as [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<26, (5, 10, 15)>, <15, (3, 11, 26)>, <14, (0, 1, 19)>, <11, (15, 8, 29)>.

These unique 3-stars are listed separately inside <>.
