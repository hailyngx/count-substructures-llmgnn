Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors in parentheses are as follows:
1: (3)
2: (13, 20, 25, 10)
3: (1, 11, 20, 16)
4: (5)
5: (4, 25)
6: (9, 24, 20)
7: (29, 14)
8: (13, 15, 12)
9: (6, 25, 21, 17)
10: (24, 14, 2)
11: (3, 27, 19)
12: (8, 13, 27, 18)
13: (8, 12, 2, 18)
14: (7, 18, 22, 10)
15: (8, 16, 19)
16: (3, 21, 24, 15)
17: (9)
18: (13, 12, 28, 14)
19: (11, 15, 0)
20: (3, 6, 2, 23)
21: (9, 16, 22)
22: (21, 14, 0)
23: (20, 24, 25)
24: (6, 16, 0, 10, 23)
25: (9, 2, 23, 5)
26: 
27: (12, 11, 28)
28: (27, 29, 18)
29: (7, 28)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (1, 11, 16)> and <3, (1, 11, 20)> and <3, (1, 16, 20)> and <3, (11, 16, 20)>, so there are 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: <6, (9, 20, 24)>, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (12, 13, 15)>, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (6, 21, 25)> and <9, (6, 17, 21)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: <12, (8, 13, 18)> and <12, (8, 18, 27)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: <13, (8, 18, 2)> and <13, (8, 18, 28)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <14, (7, 18, 22)> and <14, (7, 14, 18)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (3, 15, 21)> and <16, (3, 21, 24)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: <18, (13, 14, 28)> and <18, (12, 14, 22)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors: <20, (3, 6, 23)> and <20, (3, 2, 23)>, so there are 2 3-stars.
Node 24 has 5 neighbors: <24, (6, 16, 23)>, so there is 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
