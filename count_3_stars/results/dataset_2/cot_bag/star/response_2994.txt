Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Thus, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
