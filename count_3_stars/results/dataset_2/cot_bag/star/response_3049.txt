Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 13) (18, 9) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 17) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 4) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 14) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (11, 15, 17)>, <3, (11, 14, 17)>, <3, (15, 10, 17)>, <3, (10, 6, 14)>

Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<10, (15, 0, 6)>, <10, (15, 0, 5)>, <10, (15, 6, 5)>, <10, (0, 6, 5)>

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<11, (3, 6, 17)>, <11, (3, 6, 17)>, <11, (3, 17, 14)>, <11, (6, 17, 16)>

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (3, 7, 13)>, <14, (3, 7, 0)>, <14, (3, 13, 7)>, <14, (7, 13, 0)>

Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<16, (8, 2, 4)>, <16, (8, 2, 19)>, <16, (8, 4, 19)>, <16, (2, 4, 19)>

Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (11, 3, 12)>, <17, (11, 3, 8)>, <17, (11, 12, 8)>, <17, (3, 12, 8)>

Adding them up, we have a total of [ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 ] 3-stars in the graph.
