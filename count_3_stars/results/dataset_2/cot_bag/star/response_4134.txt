Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 8, 13, 2, 0, 14, 12, 11, and 3.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations: 
\( 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55 \)

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is [55]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
