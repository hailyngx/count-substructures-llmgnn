Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 4 neighbors, which are nodes 14, 3, 10, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <14, (17, 18, 9)>
- <3, (1, 10, 16)>
- <10, (11, 15, 9)>
- <9, (14, 10, 12)>
