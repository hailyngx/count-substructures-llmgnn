Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (18, 4) (18, 27) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 20) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 22) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 27) (14, 13) (21, 28) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 2) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 24) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 20) (19, 5) (19, 23) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 25) (17, 21) (17, 13) (17, 2) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 20) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 11) (23, 26) (23, 19) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 24) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 21) (20, 6) (20, 16) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 15) (2, 3) (2, 28) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 0) (15, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 27) (10, 25) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 10) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 10)>
- <5, (1, 19, 24)>
- <21, (8, 17, 29)>
- <22, (0, 11, 25)>
- <24, (5, 13, 11)>
- <26, (16, 23, 29)>
- <28, (2, 16, 21)>
- <29, (7, 21, 25)>
