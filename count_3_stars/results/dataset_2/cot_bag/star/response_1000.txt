Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 69 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 7)>.
