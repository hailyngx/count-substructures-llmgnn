Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 15) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 14) (27, 5) (27, 12) (27, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 14) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 1) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 14) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 24) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 24) (8, 20) (8, 18) (1, 10) (6, 14) (19, 22) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 2) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 23) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 6) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 16) (2, 28) (2, 19) (2, 17) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 20) (25, 29) (25, 26) (16, 20) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 17) 

Response:
There are 22 nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
6. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
8. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
10. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
11. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
12. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
14. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
15. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
17. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
19. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
20. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
21. Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
22. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [80].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, 19, 29>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 17, 18>, <4, 14, 15>, <5, 9, 28>, <5, 14, 6>, <5, 27, 24>, <7, 19, 2>, <7, 26, 10>, <9, 19, 22>, <9, 11, 24>, <11, 9, 21>, <13, 22, 29>, <13, 22, 19>, <13, 21, 15>, <13, 12, 27>, <13, 18, 8>, <14, 5, 12>, <14, 15, 29>, <15, 21, 11>, <15, 29, 26>, <18, 17, 4>, <19, 9, 5>, <19, 7, 20>, <20, 7, 24>, <21, 13, 26>, <22, 13, 21>, <24, 7, 27>, <26, 13, 12>
