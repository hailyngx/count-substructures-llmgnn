Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 4

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14

Now we find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 84 \)

So, there are 84 3-stars in the given graph, and we can list them as follows:
\[ \{1, 0, 13\}, \{1, 2, 6\}, \{1, 4, 13\}, \{1, 4, 6\}, \{1, 4, 9\}, \{1, 6, 7\}, \{1, 6, 13\}, \{1, 9, 7\}, \{1, 9, 14\}, \{1, 13, 4\}, \{2, 0, 12\}, \{2, 8, 1\}, \{2, 8, 3\}, \{2, 8, 12\}, \{3, 4, 1\}, \{4, 5, 12\}, \{4, 5, 13\}, \{4, 6, 13\}, \{4, 7, 11\}, \{4, 7, 14\}, \{4, 9, 7\}, \{4, 9, 14\}, \{5, 0, 12\}, \{5, 0, 7\}, \{5, 7, 10\}, \{6, 1, 13\}, \{6, 4, 13\}, \{6, 7, 11\}, \{6, 13, 1\}, \{7, 10, 11\}, \{7, 10, 14\}, \{9, 7, 14\}, \{10, 11, 7\}, \{14, 7, 4\} \] 

Therefore, there are 84 3-stars in total in this graph.
