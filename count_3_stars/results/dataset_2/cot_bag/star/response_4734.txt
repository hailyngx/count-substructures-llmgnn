Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 27) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 1) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 15) (20, 29) (20, 1) (29, 20) (29, 10) (11, 4) (11, 23) (11, 22) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 23) (26, 14) (26, 3) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 25) (7, 9) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 0) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 12) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 10) (24, 2) (0, 21) (0, 1) (0, 22) (19, 3) (3, 5) (3, 26) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 3) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 15) (25, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 24) (2, 25) (12, 21) (12, 17) (27, 5) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 22) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 6, 4, 18, 21, 28, 20, 29, 11, 23, 26, 8, 1, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 13), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 18, 16), (4, 11, 2), (4, 18, 28), (4, 16, 1), (4, 16, 13), so there are 5 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 28, 1), (18, 28, 25), (18, 4, 16), (18, 4, 11), so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: (21, 25, 17), (21, 0, 12), (21, 0, 25), (21, 12, 17), so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: (28, 18, 13), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (11, 23, 22), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: (23, 26, 17), (23, 24, 27), (23, 11, 22), (23, 11, 17), (23, 11, 24), so there are 5 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (26, 14, 3), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 24, 25), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5, 19), (3, 26, 14), (3, 10, 24), (3, 19, 10), so there are 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (4, 6, 13)>, <4, (4, 18, 16)>, <4, (4, 11, 2)>, <4, (4, 16, 1)>, <4, (4, 16, 13)>, <18, (18, 28, 1)>, <18, (18, 28, 25)>, <18, (18 ,4, 16)>, <18, (18, 4, 11)>, <21, (21, 25, 17)>, <21, (21, 0, 12)>, <21, (21, 0, 25)>, <21, (21, 12, 17)>, <28, (28, 18, 13)>, <11, (11, 23, 22)>, <23, (23, 26, 17)>, <23, (23, 24, 27)>, <23, (23, 11, 22)>, <23, (23,11, 17)>, <23, (23, 11, 24)>, <26, (26, 14, 3)>, <8, (8, 24, 25)>, <3, (3, 5, 19)>,<3, (3, 26, 14)>, <3, (3, 10, 24)>, <3, (3, 19, 10)>.
