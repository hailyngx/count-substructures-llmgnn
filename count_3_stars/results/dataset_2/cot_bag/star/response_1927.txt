Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 29) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 0) (12, 3) (18, 28) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 25) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (28, 20) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 17) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 21) (25, 6) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 5) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 21) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 21) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 21) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 20) (21, 17) (21, 4) (21, 14) (21, 20) (19, 27) (19, 7) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars are: 
- Node 5 with neighbors 2, 1, 8, 28, and 24
- Node 11 with neighbors 27, 2, 10, 7, and 13
- Node 16 with neighbors 13, 7, 24, and 14
- Node 17 with neighbors 27, 9, 22, and 21
- Node 28 with neighbors 18, 6, 9, 5, and 20

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 5 can form 3-stars with inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11 can form 3-stars with inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17 can form 3-stars with inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 28 can form 3-stars with inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38

So, there are 38 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:

<28, (18, 9, 5)>
<28, (18, 9, 20)>
<28, (18, 5, 20)>
<28, (9, 5, 20)>
<28, (6, 9, 5)>
<28, (6, 9, 20)>
<28, (6, 5, 20)>
<28, (9, 5, 20)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have [38].
