Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 5, 3, 11
- Node 1: 13, 2, 12, 14
- Node 2: 8, 5, 1, 10
- Node 3: 4, 8, 6, 0, 10
- Node 4: 7, 12, 3
- Node 5: 7, 8, 2, 0, 14
- Node 6: 3, 12
- Node 7: 4, 0, 10, 14, 5
- Node 8: 13, 2, 9, 5, 11, 3
- Node 9: 8, 13, 12
- Node 10: 7, 2, 12, 3, 14
- Node 11: 8, 0
- Node 12: 4, 6, 9, 10, 1
- Node 13: 8, 1, 9
- Node 14: 7, 5, 1, 10

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors, we can find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 5 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 15 3-stars
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star

Summing these up, we have a total of 35 3-stars, which can be represented as: [35].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (13, 2, 12)>
- <1, (13, 2, 14)>
- <1, (13, 1, 14)>
- <1, (2, 1, 14)>
- <3, (4, 8, 6)>
- <3, (4, 8, 10)>
- <3, (8, 6, 10)>
- <3, (8, 0, 10)>
- <3, (8, 3, 10)>
- <5, (7, 8, 14)>
- <7, (4, 12, 10)>
- <12, (4, 6, 9)>
- <12, (4, 9, 10)>
- <12, (6, 9, 10)>
- <12, (9, 10, 1)>
- <8, (13, 9, 12)>
- <8, (13, 9, 10)>
- <8, (9, 12, 1)>
- <8, (9, 12, 10)>
- <8, (9, 1, 10)>
- <8, (12, 1, 10)>
- <14, (1, 2, 10)>
