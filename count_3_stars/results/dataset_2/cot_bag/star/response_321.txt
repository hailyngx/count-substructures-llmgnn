The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 22) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 24) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 21) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (10, 13) (10, 29) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 11) (26, 25) (26, 27) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 13) (4, 28) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 2) (27, 26) (27, 4) (27, 16) (27, 6) (16, 12) (16, 27) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 28) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 1) (6, 27) (6, 25) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 24) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 25) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 23) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars generated by these nodes, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
