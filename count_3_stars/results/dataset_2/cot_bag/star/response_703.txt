Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 17) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (27, 4) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 17) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 0) (29, 22) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 5) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 6) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 5) (15, 9) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 5) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 28) (5, 25) (20, 16) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 10) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 6) (25, 12) (25, 5) (16, 14) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
There are 3-star formations around the following nodes: 1, 4, 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, 26.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 26 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (12, 19, 23)>, <4, (7, 14, 27)>, <7, (0, 14, 17)>, <12, (1, 25, 27)>, <14, (0, 9, 16)>, <16, (14, 20, 23)>, <17, (0, 21, 27)>, <21, (3, 17, 23)>, <26, (2, 6, 13)>.
