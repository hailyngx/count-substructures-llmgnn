Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 26) (11, 12) (11, 29) (11, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (23, 7) (23, 9) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (28, 8) (28, 7) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 25) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 4) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 5) (0, 21) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 24) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 21) (19, 1) (19, 24) (5, 2) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 7) (25, 15) (25, 26) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 4) (29, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 7) (24, 13) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 24) (14, 16) (14, 23) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are four nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 11, 12, 15, and 26. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [13] \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <11, (12, 20, 29)>
2. <11, (12, 20, 17)>
3. <11, (12, 5, 2)>
4. <11, (12, 5, 20)>
5. <12, (11, 1, 22)>
6. <12, (11, 1, 5)>
7. <12, (11, 1, 29)>
8. <12, (11, 1, 20)>
9. <15, (27, 25, 13)>
10. <26, (11, 23, 18)>
11. <26, (11, 23, 25)>
12. <26, (11, 23, 14)>
13. <26, (11, 23, 7)>
