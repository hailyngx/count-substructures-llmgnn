Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 17) (6, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 15) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 8) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 15) (7, 15) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 6) (8, 12) (8, 15)

Based on the information provided, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 9, 15, and 16 have at least three neighbors each, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it will form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these together, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 16)>, 
<0, (3, 12, 16)>, 
<0, (4, 12, 16)>, 
<0, (3, 16, 17)>, 
<0, (4, 16, 17)>, 
<0, (12, 16, 17)>, 
<9, (5, 11, 16)>, 
<9, (9, 14, 16)>, 
<9, (5, 9, 16)>, 
<15, (7, 8, 13)>, 
<15, (7, 13, 19)>, 
<15, (8, 13, 19)>, 
<15, (8, 15, 19)>.
