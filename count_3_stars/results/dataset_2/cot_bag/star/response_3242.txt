Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 24) (8, 2) (8, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 23) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 27) (28, 13) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 25) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 23) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 12) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 27) (13, 28) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 29) (20, 2) (20, 26) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 15) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 25) (6, 1) (14, 13) (14, 23) (14, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 29) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 16) (25, 22) (25, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 26) (23, 21) (23, 24) (23, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars we counted gives a total of 43 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [43].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
