Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (8, 9, 4)>
<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 1, 2)>
<5, (8, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (8, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>
<9, (8, 1, 5)>
