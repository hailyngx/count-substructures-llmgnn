Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 17) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 10) (19, 14) (19, 10) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 18) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (13, 9) (13, 7) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edge list, we find that the following nodes have three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 17, 14, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 17, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 14, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {16, 9, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 13, 1, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {11, 5, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 19, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 0, 9, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 1, 19, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors {11, 10, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 12}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 17, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star for each node.
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with node 8.
- Node 5 also forms a 3-star with node 16.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with both node 7 and node 17.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with node 10.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with node 19.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the above, which is [11 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 18.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (11, 2, 3)>
- <1, (7, 17, 14, 18)>
- <3, (11, 17, 0)>
- <4, (7, 8, 14, 17)>
- <4, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (16, 9, 5)>
- <7, (4, 13, 1, 17)>
- <9, (11, 5, 9)>
- <10, (3, 19, 10)>
- <11, (3, 0, 11)>
- <14, (4, 15, 19)>
