Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors [4, 8, 2, 9, 0]
- Node 2: neighbors [8, 5, 6, 1, 9, 7]
- Node 3: neighbors [4, 5, 9]
- Node 4: neighbors [8, 3, 1]
- Node 5: neighbors [6, 2, 0, 3]
- Node 6: neighbors [5, 2, 0]
- Node 7: neighbors [8, 2, 9]
- Node 8: neighbors [4, 2, 1, 7]
- Node 9: neighbors [2, 1, 3, 7, 0]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<1, (8, 2, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 5, 6)>
<2, (8, 5, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 0, 3)>
<2, (5, 0, 9)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 5, 0)>
<2, (2, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 1, 3)>
