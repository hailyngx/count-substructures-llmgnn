Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (27, 17) (3, 2) (3, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 26) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 9) (21, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 8) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 17) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 4) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 20) (5, 24) (5, 14) (19, 3) (19, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 1) (29, 10) (29, 19) (4, 20) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 24) (14, 23) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (24, 0) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 6) (8, 21) (8, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the formula \({{n}\choose{3}}\) to each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: <0, (13, 23, 24)>. \([1\])
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (2, 8, 9)>. \([1\])
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: <2, (3, 18, 1)>. \([1\])
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (12, 20, 26)>. \([1\])
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (6, 9, 21)>. \([1\])
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (1, 15, 25)>. \([1\])
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: <10, (16, 21, 29)>. \([1\])
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: <11, (14, 24, 26)>. \([1\])
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: <14, (5, 11, 18)>. \([1\])
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: <15, (9, 17, 20)>. \([1\])
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: <16, (10, 18, 21)>. \([1\])
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (15, 18, 20)>. \([1\])
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: <18, (2, 16, 17)>. \([1\])
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: <20, (4, 15, 17)>. \([1\])
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: <21, (7, 10, 16)>. \([1\])
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: <23, (0, 14, 16)>. \([1\])
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: <24, (5, 6, 11)>. \([1\])
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: <26, (4, 11, 28)>. \([1\])
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: <28, (1, 15, 26)>. \([1\])
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([20]\).
