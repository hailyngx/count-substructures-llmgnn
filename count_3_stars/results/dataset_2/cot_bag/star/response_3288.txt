Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 2) (4, 14) (4, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around them:

1. Node 0: (11, 0) (14, 0) (17, 0) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 2) (total: 4 3-stars)

2. Node 2: (5, 2) (9, 2) (17, 2) (18, 2) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 18) (total: 4 3-stars)

3. Node 3: (1, 3) (8, 3) (7, 3) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (total: 1 3-star)

4. Node 6: (16, 6) (8, 6) (4, 6) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 19) (total: 4 3-stars)

5. Node 8: (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (8, 3) (total: 1 3-star)

6. Node 10: (11, 10) (17, 10) (12, 10) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (total: 2 3-stars)

7. Node 11: (16, 11) (10, 11) (15, 11) (0, 11) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (total: 4 3-stars)

8. Node 13: (5, 13) (8, 13) (15, 13) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 15) (total: 1 3-star)

9. Node 14: (17, 14) (4, 14) (0, 14) (14, 17) (14, 4) (total: 1 3-star)

10. Node 15: (11, 15) (12, 15) (13, 15) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 12) (total: 2 3-stars)

11. Node 16: (11, 16) (19, 16) (6, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 6) (total: 2 3-stars)

12. Node 17: (14, 17) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (10, 17) (0, 17) (2, 17) (18, 17) (total: 4 3-stars)

13. Node 18: (17, 18) (1, 18) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (total: 1 3-star)

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 31

Thus, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars identified: 
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 2, 17>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 17, 18>
<3, 1, 8>
<6, 4, 16>
<8, 3, 13>
<10, 11, 17>
<11, 15, 16>
<13, 8, 15>
<14, 4, 17>
<15, 11, 12>
<16, 6, 19>
<17, 0, 2>
<18, 1, 17>
