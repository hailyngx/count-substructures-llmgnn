Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 20) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 20) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 8) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 29) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 21) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 2) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 4) (16, 21) (16, 9) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 16) (21, 9) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 25) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 23) (2, 23) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 6) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 4) (26, 2) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 2) (29, 12) (29, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 27, 14, 17, 20, 12, and 9.

For node 27:
- There are 3 neighbors: 15, 17, 26
- So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 27 as the center.

For node 14:
- There are 2 neighbors: 17, 9
- No 3-star can be formed as there are less than 3 neighbors.

For node 17:
- There are 4 neighbors: 27, 14, 13, 9
- So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 17 as the center. The 3-stars are <17, (27, 13, 14)>, <17, (27, 13, 9)>, <17, (27, 14, 9)>, <17, (13, 14, 9)>.

For node 20:
- There are 4 neighbors: 22, 11, 0, 10
- So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 20 as the center. The 3-stars are <20, (22, 11, 0)>, <20, (22, 11, 10)>, <20, (22, 0, 10)>, <20, (11, 0, 10)>.

For node 12:
- There are 4 neighbors: 7, 5, 29, 8
- So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the center. The 3-stars are <12, (7, 5, 29)>, <12, (7, 5, 8)>, <12, (7, 29, 8)>, <12, (5, 29, 8)>.

For node 9:
- There are 4 neighbors: 14, 28, 16, 21
- So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. The 3-stars are <9, (14, 28, 16)>, <9, (14, 28, 21)>, <9, (14, 16, 21)>, <9, (28, 16, 21)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21.  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <27, (15, 17, 26)>, <17, (27, 13, 14)>, <17, (27, 13, 9)>, <17, (27, 14, 9)>, <17, (13, 14, 9)>, <20, (22, 11, 0)>, <20, (22, 11, 10)>, <20, (22, 0, 10)>, <20, (11, 0, 10)>, <12, (7, 5, 29)>, <12, (7, 5, 8)>, <12, (7, 29, 8)>, <12, (5, 29, 8)>, <9, (14, 28, 16)>, <9, (14, 28, 21)>, <9, (14, 16, 21)>, <9, (28, 16, 21)>.
