Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 19) (6, 18) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 11) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 0) (11, 12) (11, 19) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors --> [1]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors --> [inom{4}{3} = 4]

Summing these up: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27 \).

Therefore, there are 27 3-stars in this graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 14, 2)>
<0, (7, 14, 13)>
<0, (14, 17, 5)>
<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<0, (2, 8, 13)>
<2, (8, 4, 16)>
<2, (8, 5, 13)>
<4, (7, 10, 8)>
<8, (2, 16, 12)>
<8, (16, 18, 12)>
<12, (18, 16, 13)>
<16, (14, 18, 12)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars in total. So the final answer is [12].
