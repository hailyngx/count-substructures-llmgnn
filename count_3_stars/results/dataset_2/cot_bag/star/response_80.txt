Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes could potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 12, 14, 2
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 11
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 12
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 14, 0
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 11
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 10, 13
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 11, 13
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 14
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9, 12
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 10, 11
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 9, 7
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 10

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each eligible node: 

\(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 62. 

The unique 3-stars found are:  <0, (4, 8, 12)>, <4, (0, 5, 11)>, <5, (1, 6, 11)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 11)>, <11, (1, 4, 5)>, <12, (0, 3, 4)>.
