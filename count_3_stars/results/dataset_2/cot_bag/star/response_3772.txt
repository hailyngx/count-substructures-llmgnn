Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually to better understand the connections between the nodes in the graph.

The graph can be represented as follows:

```
  1 -- 5 -- 2
 /|    |    |\
7 |    |    | 6
 \|    |    |/
  3 -- 9 -- 0
         |
         4
         |
         8
```

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
