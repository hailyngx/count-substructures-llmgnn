Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (27, 15) (27, 29) (3, 19) (3, 9) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 10) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 29) (1, 8) (1, 14) (26, 16) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 18) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 16) (7, 25) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 29) (21, 5) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 2) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 14) (22, 17) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 20) (16, 12) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 11) (29, 10) (0, 21) (0, 24) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 2) (24, 0) (24, 18) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 19) (9, 3) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 21) (2, 23) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) 

Response:
There are multiple ways to construct the 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify them one by one.

For node 7: 
- \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars can be formed.  
- The unique 3-stars are <7, (25, 8, 11)>, <7, (25, 11, 18)>, <7, (8, 11, 29)>, <7, (11, 18, 28)>, <7, (11, 28, 12)>, <7, (11, 28, 18)>, <7, (11, 28, 20)>, <7, (11, 28, 18)>, <7, (11, 29, 10)>, <7, (18, 28, 20)>

For node 10: 
- \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars can be formed.  
- The unique 3-stars are <10, (25, 21, 19)>, <10, (25, 21, 12)>, <10, (25, 21, 0)>, <10, (25, 21, 18)>, <10, (25, 12, 16)>, <10, (21, 5, 12)>, <10, (21, 0, 24)>, <10, (21, 18, 24)>, <10, (21, 18, 28)>, <10, (21, 2, 23)>

For node 11: 
- 1 3-star can be formed.  
- The unique 3-star is <11, (7, 28, 29)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of [10 + 10 + 1] = 21 3-stars in this graph.
