Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:

- Node 0: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <0, (8, 10, 12)>
  <> <0, (8, 11, 12)>
  <> <0, (10, 11, 12)>
  <> <0, (11, 12, 8)>

- Node 1: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <1, (4, 12, 13)>
  <> <1, (4, 12, 2)>
  <> <1, (4, 13, 2)>
  <> <1, (4, 13, 12)>

- Node 2: 3-stars = [6]
  <> <2, (1, 4, 13)>
  <> <2, (1, 13, 5)>
  <> <2, (1, 4, 5)>
  <> <2, (4, 5, 6)>
  <> <2, (5, 6, 13)>
  <> <2, (4, 5, 13)>

- Node 3: 3-stars = [1]
  <> <3, (7, 11, 13)>

- Node 4: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <4, (1, 6, 13)>
  <> <4, (1, 6, 14)>
  <> <4, (1, 2, 6)>
  <> <4, (6, 13, 14)>

- Node 5: 3-stars = [3]
  <> <5, (10, 11, 14)>
  <> <5, (11, 3, 5)>
  <> <5, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 6: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <6, (4, 12, 13)>
  <> <6, (12, 0, 13)>
  <> <6, (12, 4, 8)>
  <> <6, (12, 8, 13)>

- Node 8: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <8, (7, 12, 13)>
  <> <8, (7, 8, 13)>
  <> <8, (12, 13, 2)>
  <> <8, (2, 12, 13)>

- Node 9: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <9, (10, 12, 14)>
  <> <9, (4, 9, 14)>
  <> <9, (4, 12, 9)>
  <> <9, (12, 14, 9)>

- Node 10: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <10, (0, 5, 9)>
  <> <10, (0, 10, 5)>
  <> <10, (5, 9, 10)>
  <> <10, (0, 9, 10)>

- Node 11: 3-stars = [2]
  <> <11, (0, 3, 5)>
  <> <11, (3, 5, 11)>

- Node 12: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <12, (1, 6, 13)>
  <> <12, (4, 8, 12)>
  <> <12, (6, 13, 14)>
  <> <12, (8, 13, 12)>

- Node 13: 3-stars = [4]
  <> <13, (2, 4, 6)>
  <> <13, (2, 6, 8)>
  <> <13, (4, 6, 13)>
  <> <13, (4, 6, 12)>

- Node 14: 3-stars = [3]
  <> <14, (6, 7, 9)>
  <> <14, (7, 9, 14)>
  <> <14, (7, 9, 12)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes, we get [40].
