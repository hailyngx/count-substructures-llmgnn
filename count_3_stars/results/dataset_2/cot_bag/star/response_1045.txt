Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 0) (4, 12) (4, 15) (18, 8) (18, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 15) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 6, 8, 9, 15, and 16.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Total neighbors: 3
- Total 3-stars: 1

For node 6:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Total 3-stars: 4

For node 8:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Total 3-stars: 4

For node 9:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Total 3-stars: 10

For node 15:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Total 3-stars: 4

For node 16:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Total 3-stars: 4

The total number of 3-stars is 27 <0, 6, 15>, <6, 9, 15>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 18>, <9, 13, 17>, <9, 13, 19>, <9, 16, 1>, <9, 16, 15>, <15, 4, 12>, <15, 4, 5>, <15, 5, 8>, <16, 1, 9>, <16, 1, 15>, <16, 11, 8>, <16, 11, 15>, <16, 15, 6>, <16, 15, 1>, <16, 15, 5>, <16, 15, 9>, <16, 15, 11>, <16, 15, 6>, <16, 15, 9>, <16, 15, 1>, <16, 15, 5>, <16, 15, 11>, <16, 15, 0>, <16, 15, 6>.
