Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 4, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: 
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [63] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 0, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 14)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>
<4, (12, 13, 14)>
<14, (4, 1, 3)>
