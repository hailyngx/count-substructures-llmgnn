Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9), (7, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0), (0, 8), (0, 9), (8, 3), (9, 2)}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 9}
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 2}
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 9, 1, 3}
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 2}
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {7, 3, 5, 1, 2}
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 3, 9, 8}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: [ $\binom{4}{3}$ ] = [ 4 ]
2. Node 1: [ $\binom{4}{3}$ ] = [ 4 ]
3. Node 2: [ $\binom{5}{3}$ ] = [ 10 ]
4. Node 3: [ $\binom{4}{3}$ ] = [ 4 ]
5. Node 4: [ $\binom{5}{3}$ ] = [ 10 ]
6. Node 7: [ $\binom{4}{3}$ ] = [ 4 ]

Finally, summing up these results gives a total of [ 32 ] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<2, (4, 1, 2)>
<4, (7, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
 
These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
