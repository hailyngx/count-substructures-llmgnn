Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 10) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
This graph has several nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will identify the 3-stars formed around these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (17, 18, 1) => 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 11, 12) => 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (8, 10, 3) => 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (5, 2, 7, 14) => 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (5, 6) => 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (19, 11, 4, 3) => 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (19, 3, 15) => 1 3-star
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (13, 2, 9, 16, 15) => 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (8, 18, 17, 0) => 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (2, 14) => 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (5, 1, 18, 12) => 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (17, 11, 1) => 1 3-star
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (8, 17) => 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (3, 18, 10) => 1 3-star
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (8, 17, 7) => 1 3-star
- Node 17: 5 neighbors (13, 9, 0, 12, 15) => 10 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (9, 0, 11, 14) => 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (5, 7) => 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (17, 18, 1)>, 
<1, (0, 11, 12)>,
<2, (8, 10, 3)>,
<3, (5, 2, 7)>,
<5, (19, 11, 4)>,
<7, (19, 3, 15)>,
<8, (13, 9, 16)>,
<9, (8, 18, 17)>,
<11, (5, 18, 12)>,
<14, (3, 18, 10)>,
<15, (8, 17, 7)>,
<17, (13, 9, 15)>.
