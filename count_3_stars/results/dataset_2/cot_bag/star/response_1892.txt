Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
Node 0: 5, 7, 1, 8, 2
Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 4, 0
Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8
Node 9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 7
Node 2: 9, 1, 6, 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<6, (3, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 1, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>

So, the final count of 3-stars formed is [54].
