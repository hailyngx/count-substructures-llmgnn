Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed for these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total 3-stars formed: \(10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 92\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, 10, 11>  
<1, 2, 14>  
<1, 12, 14>  
<1, 12, 5>
