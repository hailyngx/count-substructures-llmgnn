Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 24) (23, 28) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) (28, 18) (28, 23) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) (7, 8) (7, 24) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) (10, 20) (10, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6) 

Response:
The node with the most edges is node 9, which has degree 5. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 9, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For the other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can't form any additional 3-stars, as they do not have a degree of at least 3.

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10] = 20 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<9, (11, 19, 27)>
<9, (19, 25, 27)>
<9, (19, 25, 4)>
<9, (19, 9, 25)>
<9, (25, 4, 20)>
<6, (0, 13, 29)>
<6, (0, 6, 13)>
<6, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (0, 6, 4)>
<6, (13, 6, 29)>
