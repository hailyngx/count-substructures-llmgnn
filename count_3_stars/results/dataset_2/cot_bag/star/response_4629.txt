Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: There are 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6, 9), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 2: There are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 3: There are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 4: There are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8, 9), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 6: There are 4 neighbors (3, 7, 9, 0), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 7: There are 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 9: There are 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8, 0), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding all these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42 \). 

Therefore, inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>,  
<0, (1, 4, 6)>,  
<0, (1, 4, 9)>,  
<0, (4, 5, 7)>,  
<0, (4, 6, 9)>,  
<0, (6, 7, 9)>,  
<2, (1, 4, 8)>,  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>,  
<4, (0, 2, 8)>,  
<4, (0, 3, 8)>,  
<4, (2, 3, 8)>,  
<4, (3, 8, 9)>,  
<6, (7, 9, 0)>,  
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
