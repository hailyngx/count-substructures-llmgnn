Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
8. Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
10. Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
11. Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
12. Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
13. Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
14. Node 14 has 1 neighbor.
15. Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
16. Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
17. Node 17 has 2 neighbors.
18. Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
19. Node 19 has 4 neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the contributions, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 10>
- <1, 2, 16>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 3, 16>
- <1, 10, 16>
- <2, 6, 19>
- <5, 9, 17>
- <5, 13, 17>
- <7, 12, 19>
- <7, 16, 19>
- <9, 14, 17>
- <11, 13, 19>
