Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 29) (9, 16) (9, 25) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (27, 11) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 8) (18, 26) (18, 19) (22, 5) (22, 24) (10, 26) (10, 7) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 29) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 2) (28, 23) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 19) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 23) (0, 12) (3, 12) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (13, 21) (13, 4) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 2) (8, 5) (8, 27) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 4) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 21) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 6) (24, 22) (24, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 23) 

Response:
Using the given information on the nodes and edges provided, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46]. The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:

<5, (6, 16, 29)>
<6, (5, 16, 29)>
<9, (16, 15, 25)>
<11, (19, 27, 20)>
<12, (7, 0, 3)>
<16, (29, 5, 6)>
<17, (19, 1, 3)>
<19, (11, 18, 28)>
<20, (11, 7, 4)>
<21, (25, 13, 2)>
<23, (28, 17, 14)>
<26, (27, 18, 10)>
<27, (11, 28, 8)>
<28, (27, 19, 2)>
<29, (16, 5, 6)>
