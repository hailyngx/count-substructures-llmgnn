Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 13) (11, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 19) (14, 2) (17, 0) (17, 11) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 7) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, not forming a 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, thus forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is $1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 38$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 17, 19)>, <2, (0, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 18)>, <5, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 10, 13)>, <8, (1, 6, 18)>, <9, (4, 10, 19)>, <10, (7, 9, 18)>, <11, (3, 13, 17)>, <13, (4, 7, 11)>, <19, (3, 9, 12)>.
