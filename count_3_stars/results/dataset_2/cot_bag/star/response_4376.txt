Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 3: [6 choose 3] = 20
- For Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10
- For Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
- For Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the final result is [54].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
