Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 18) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) 

Response:
From the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 19. 

The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 4
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 4
- Node 16: 2
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 3

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars.
Nodes that can form 3-stars are:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 19

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed:
Number of 3-stars = [ 19 choose 3 ] = 969
