Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 16) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 3) (7, 18) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (22, 28) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 28) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 29) (13, 20) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 3) (12, 1) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 17) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 23) (28, 22) (28, 25) (28, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (5, 19) (5, 1) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (10, 19) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 16) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 15) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 24) (23, 21) (23, 16) (17, 27) (17, 28) (0, 26) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 15) (16, 23) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 : 1, 18, 24, 25, 26
- Node 1 : 0, 5, 12
- Node 2 : 3, 6, 18, 21
- Node 3 : 2, 7, 12, 24
- Node 4 : 6, 21
- Node 5 : 1, 19
- Node 6 : 2, 4, 11
- Node 7 : 3, 18
- Node 8 : 19, 25, 29
- Node 9 : 16, 29
- Node 10 : 14, 15, 19
- Node 11 : 6, 24, 26
- Node 12 : 1, 3, 27
- Node 13 : 14, 20
- Node 14 : 10, 13, 20
- Node 15 : 10, 16, 26, 29
- Node 16 : 9, 15, 20, 23
- Node 17 : 27, 28
- Node 18 : 0, 2, 7
- Node 19 : 5, 8, 10
- Node 20 : 13, 14, 16, 27
- Node 21 : 2, 4, 23
- Node 22 : 28
- Node 23 : 16, 21
- Node 24 : 0, 11, 26, 3
- Node 25 : 0, 8, 28
- Node 26 : 0, 11, 15, 24
- Node 27 : 12, 17, 20
- Node 28 : 17, 22, 25
- Node 29 : 9, 8, 15

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 56 + 455 + 560 + 816 + 1140 + 2024 + 2300 + 2600 + 2925 = 11889 \]

So, there are a total of 11889 3-stars in this graph.
