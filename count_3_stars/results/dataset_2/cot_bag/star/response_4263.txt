Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 1, 0, 3. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 5, 1, 7, 0, 2, 4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 0, 2. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 3, 7, 8, 1. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 2, 7. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 2, 7. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 7.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: 

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars are:
