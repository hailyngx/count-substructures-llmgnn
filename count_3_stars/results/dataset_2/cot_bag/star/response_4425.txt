Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 11, 8, 7, 12, 1. So, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 11, 8, 0. So, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 4, 3. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 9, 11, 2, 2. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 11, 14, 7, 8. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 0, 14, 13. So, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 0, 3, 1. So, inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 1, 12. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
11. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 13, 14, 9. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
12. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 1, 0, 6, 4. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
13. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 0, 13. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
14. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 10, 3, 7, 12. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
15. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 6, 7. So, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get a total of 110 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [110].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 11, 8>, <0, 1, 12, 9>, <0, 1, 8, 7>, <0, 1, 11, 6>, <0, 7, 5, 13>, <1, 0, 11, 6>, <1, 0, 8, 7>, <1, 9, 4, 12>, <2, 4, 8, 3>, <3, 5, 7, 13>, <4, 2, 8, 11>, <6, 7, 13, 14>, <8, 0, 11, 6>, <9, 1, 11, 4>, <9, 1, 12, 13>, <10, 1, 11, 0>, <10, 1, 13, 14>, <12, 0, 11, 6>, <13, 12, 9, 4>, <14, 6, 7, 13>.
