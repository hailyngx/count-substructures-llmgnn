Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 16) (0, 13) (0, 4) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 19) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 14, and 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 19.
- Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, 13, 14, 19>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 9, 15, and 16.
- Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: 
<3, 2, 7, 9>, <3, 2, 7, 15>, <3, 2, 9, 15>, <3, 7, 9, 15>, <3, 2, 9, 16>, 
<3, 7, 9, 16>, <3, 7, 15, 16>, <3, 9, 15, 16>, <3, 2, 15, 16>, <3, 9, 15, 16>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 11, and 12.
- There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, 0, 8, 13>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 17, and 19.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
<6, 8, 9, 19>, <6, 8, 9, 17>, <6, 8, 17, 19>, <6, 9, 17, 19>.

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 15, 16, and 17.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center: 
<10, 5, 15, 17>, <10, 5, 15, 16>, <10, 5, 16, 17>, <10, 15, 16, 17>.

For node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- There is 1 3-star with node 13 as the center: <13, 0, 1, 4>.

For node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 17.
- Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center: <14, 1, 13, 17>.

For node 16:
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 19.
- There is 1 3-star with node 16 as the center: <16, 3, 10, 19>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23.
So, the final total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
