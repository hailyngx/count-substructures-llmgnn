Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<11, (3, 6, 15)>
<16, (1, 6, 8)>
<14, (17, 6, 10)>
<17, (8, 15, 18)>
<6, (9, 14, 15)>
<15, (11, 6, 18)>
<1, (10, 12, 16)>
<3, (1, 4, 11)>
<10, (1, 12, 14)>
<8, (15, 16, 17)>
<9, (2, 6, 19)>
<19, (0, 7, 9)>
