Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 15) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (9, 18) (9, 19) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 13) (1, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 17, 5, 6, 18, 2, 8, 12, 0, 14, 11, 9, 15, 3, 16, 19, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [4].
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: [1].
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: [4].

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (1, 18, 14)>
<7, (12, 16, 11)>
<17, (10, 16, 15)>
<5, (6, 2, 18)>
<6, (14, 8, 13)>
<18, (9, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 8, 19)>
<12, (15, 10, 13)>
<0, (11, 13, 15)>
<11, (0, 3, 7)>
<15, (17, 12, 13)>
<19, (2, 9, 16)>
<13, (6, 12, 0)>
<1, (4, 18, 14)> 
We have a total of 14 unique 3-stars.
