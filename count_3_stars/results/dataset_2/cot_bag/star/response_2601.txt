Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 2
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 2, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 4, 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 7, 0, 2
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 1, 0
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 4, 8
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 4, 0
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, 2
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, 1

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars. Therefore, the final result is [46].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <2, (5, 1, 4)>, <3, (9, 7, 4)>, <4, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <7, (6, 1, 3)>.
