Response:
Based on the given information, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 1 has neighbors: 21, 11, 0, 12, 8
Node 2 has neighbors: 29, 19, 9, 25
Node 3 has neighbors: 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 23, 20, 16
Node 5 has neighbors: 22, 29, 10
Node 6 has neighbors: 13, 27, 10
Node 7 has neighbors: 21, 19, 18
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 17, 15
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 16, 3
Node 10 has neighbors: 5, 6, 12
Node 11 has neighbors: 1, 23, 28
Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 24, 10
Node 13 has neighbors: 22, 15, 6
Node 14 has neighbors: 13, 22, 15
Node 15 has neighbors: 13, 21, 23, 8, 14
Node 16 has neighbors: 9, 4
Node 17 has neighbors: 8, 27
Node 18 has neighbors: 29, 7
Node 19 has neighbors: 2, 7, 28, 27
Node 20 has neighbors: 27, 4
Node 21 has neighbors: 1, 7, 15
Node 22 has neighbors: 13, 23, 14, 5, 0
Node 23 has neighbors: 22, 11, 15, 4
Node 24 has neighbors: 26, 12
Node 25 has neighbors: 2
Node 26 has neighbors: 24
Node 27 has neighbors: 29, 20, 17, 19, 6
Node 28 has neighbors: 11, 19
Node 29 has neighbors: 2, 27, 5, 18

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 11: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 13: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 16: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 22: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 23: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 28: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 34
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
