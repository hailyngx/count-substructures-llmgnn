Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 55 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 2, 0)>, <1, (8, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 1, 2)>, <3, (2, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 5)>, <6, (9, 3, 6)>, <7, (8, 3, 7)>, <8, (5, 1, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 9)>.
