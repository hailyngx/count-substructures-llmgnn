Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 0) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Based on the given edges, the neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 4}
- Node 12: {10}
- Node 13: {0, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 7, 9, 13}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 1: Only 1 3-star can be formed: <1, (2, 7, 14)>
- For Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 5: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 8: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 11: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 12: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 83

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [83].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 7, 14)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 7, 14)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 14)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <14, (1, 7, 9)>
