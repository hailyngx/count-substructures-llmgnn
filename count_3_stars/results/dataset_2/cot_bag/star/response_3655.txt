Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we have the following 3-star graphs: 

[55] 

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
