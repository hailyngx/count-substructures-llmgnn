Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 19) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 27) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 20) (4, 28) (4, 3) (4, 16) (16, 4) (16, 8) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 25) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 25) (0, 8) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (6, 17) (6, 25) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 16) (8, 0) (1, 22) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 19) (20, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors
- Node 7 with 4 neighbors
- Node 21 with 3 neighbors
- Node 22 with 3 neighbors
- Node 23 with 3 neighbors
- Node 12 with 5 neighbors
- Node 27 with 3 neighbors
- Node 28 with 3 neighbors
- Node 29 with 3 neighbors
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors
- Node 14 with 4 neighbors
- Node 26 with 2 neighbors
- Node 18 with 4 neighbors
- Node 19 with 3 neighbors
- Node 16 with 2 neighbors
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors
- Node 24 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 2 neighbors
- Node 17 with 2 neighbors
- Node 8 with 2 neighbors
- Node 1 with 2 neighbors
- Node 20 with 3 neighbors
- Node 15 with 3 neighbors
- Node 13 with 2 neighbors
- Node 25 with 5 neighbors
- Node 2 with 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1 * 10 = 10
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 1 * 7 = 7
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: 3-stars = 1 * 2 = 2

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 7 + 2 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 25, 28)>
<9, (5, 29, 15)>
<7, (21, 29, 14)>
<12, (27, 14, 18)>
<27, (22, 12, 14)>
<28, (5, 29, 4)>
<4, (28, 3, 16)>
<14, (7, 12, 27)>
<18, (23, 12, 19)>
<19, (9, 18, 20)>
<0, (10, 15, 25)>
<24, (23, 12, 3)>
<25, (5, 10, 0)>
