Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with more than three neighbors: 5, 9, and 8.

For node 5, there are 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. 

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

For node 8, there are 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 10] = [18] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
