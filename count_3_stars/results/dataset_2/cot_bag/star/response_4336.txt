Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {9, 4, 3, 8, 2}, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<Node 0, (9, 4, 3)>
<Node 0, (9, 4, 8)>
<Node 0, (9, 3, 8)>
<Node 0, (4, 3, 8)>

<Node 0, (4, 3, 2)>
<Node 0, (3, 8, 2)>
<Node 0, (9, 8, 2)>
<Node 0, (3, 8, 2)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {4, 3}, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {4, 8, 0}, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<Node 2, (4, 8, 0)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 1, 0}, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

<Node 3, (9, 1, 0)>
<Node 3, (6, 1, 0)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {5, 0, 1, 2, 9}, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

<Node 5, (6, 8, 3)>
<Node 5, (6, 4, 3)>
<Node 5, (8, 4, 3)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {5, 9, 3}, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<Node 6, (5, 9, 3)>

Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {9, 8}, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 7, 2}, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<Node 8, (5, 9, 7)>

<Node 8, (5, 7, 2)>
<Node 8, (9, 7, 2)>

Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 3, 7, 0}, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<Node 9, (5, 6, 8)>
<Node 9, (5, 6, 3)>
<Node 9, (5, 6, 7)>

<Node 9, (3, 7, 0)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [58] 3-stars.
