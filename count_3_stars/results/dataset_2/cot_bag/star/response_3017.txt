Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (10, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 8) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [61] \)
