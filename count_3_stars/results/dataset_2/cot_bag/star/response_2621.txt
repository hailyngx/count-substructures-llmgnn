Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
