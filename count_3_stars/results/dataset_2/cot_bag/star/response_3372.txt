Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

1: {11, 14, 10}
2: {7, 12, 13, 14}
3: {4, 11, 0, 6, 12}
4: {5, 7, 3, 10, 11}
5: {9, 4}
6: {7, 3, 13}
7: {4, 6, 2}
8: {9, 11, 14, 10, 0}
9: {5, 8, 10, 13}
10: {9, 4, 1, 8}
11: {4, 1, 3, 13, 8}
12: {3, 2, 13, 14, 0}
13: {9, 12, 6, 11, 2}
14: {1, 12, 8, 2}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
4. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
7. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
8. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
9. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 
10. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star. 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 12, 13)>
<3, (4, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 10)>
<8, (9, 11, 14)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<10, (4, 1, 8)>
<11, (3, 1, 13)>
<12, (2, 14, 0)>
<13, (9, 11, 2)>
