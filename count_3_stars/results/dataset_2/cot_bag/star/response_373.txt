Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 2, 5, and 8 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 0, 3, and 5 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 2, 4, and 5 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 0, 3, and 7 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 3, 7, and 9 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 5, 0, and 6 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 0, 3, and 4 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: Forming 3-stars with its neighbors 1, 5, and 6 gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8 \).

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

So, the final answer is: [8].
