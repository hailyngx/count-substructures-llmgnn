Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 5) (10, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 18) (16, 7) (12, 15) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 11), (0, 4), (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 19), (2, 3), (2, 17), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 10), (6, 8), (6, 0), (7, 17), (7, 9), (7, 16), (7, 18), (8, 15), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 13), (10, 5), (10, 19), (11, 5), (11, 0), (11, 9), (11, 18), (12, 15), (12, 13), (13, 1), (13, 9), (13, 12), (13, 4), (14, 18), (14, 4), (15, 8), (15, 12), (16, 7), (17, 2), (17, 4), (17, 7), (18, 7), (18, 11), (18, 14), (19, 1), (19, 10)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph: 

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:

1. Node 0: 
   - Neighbors: 3, 6, 2, 11, 4
   - Possible 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
   - 3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 2)>, <0, (3, 6, 11)>, <0, (3, 6, 4)>, <0, (3, 2, 11)>, <0, (3, 2, 4)>, <0, (3, 11, 4)>, <0, (6, 2, 11)>, <0, (6, 2, 4)>, <0, (6, 11, 4)>, <0, (2, 11, 4)>

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 5, 13, 19
   - Possible 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

3. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 3, 17, 4
   - Possible 3-stars: 1
   - 3-stars: <2, (3, 17, 4)>

4. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 0, 2
   - Possible 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

5. Nodes 4 to 19:
   - Each of these nodes has less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
