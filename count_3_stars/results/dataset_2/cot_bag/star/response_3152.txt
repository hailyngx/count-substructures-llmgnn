Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9. So, it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 9, and 6. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. So, it can form 15 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, and 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8, and 3. So, it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 15 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 9, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 7, 3)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 4, 1)>
