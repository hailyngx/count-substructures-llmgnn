Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
1: (8, 7, 12, 6, 11)
2: (19, 9)
3: (9)
4: (8, 13, 15)
5: (12, 16, 18)
6: (10, 1, 13)
7: (12, 1)
8: (17, 4, 0, 1)
9: (3, 2, 15)
10: (6, 13, 19)
11: (1, 19, 18)
12: (7, 5, 14, 1)
13: (10, 4, 6)
14: (12, 0, 19, 15)
15: (4, 0, 14, 9)
16: (17, 5)
17: (16, 8)
18: (11, 5)
19: (10, 14, 11, 2)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5,3) = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has only 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
4. Node 4 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
6. Node 6 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
8. Node 8 can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
9. Node 9 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
10. Node 10 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
11. Node 11 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
12. Node 12 can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
13. Node 13 can form C(3,3) = 1 3-star.
14. Node 14 can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
15. Node 15 can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
16. Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
17. Node 17 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
18. Node 18 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
19. Node 19 can form C(4,3) = 4 3-stars.
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31. Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
