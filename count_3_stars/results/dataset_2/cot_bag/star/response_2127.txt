Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (18, 15) (19, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 10) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 19) (13, 4) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 17.

- For node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<0, (1, 15, 16)>, <0, (4, 15, 0)>, <0, (1, 0, 4)>, <0, (15, 16, 14)>

- For node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<1, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (0, 6, 1)>, <1, (1, 8, 11)>, <1, (11, 9, 14)>

- For node 2: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

- For node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<3, (7, 9, 10)>, <3, (2, 15, 3)>, <3, (3, 7, 10)>, <3, (9, 11, 7)>

- For node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<4, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (6, 13, 4)>, <4, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (0, 13, 4)>

- For node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
<6, (1, 4, 17)>

- For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<8, (1, 12, 17)>, <8, (1, 8, 12)>, <8, (5, 8, 17)>, <8, (8, 12, 14)>

- For node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
<10, (3, 7, 13)>

- For node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<11, (1, 9, 12)>, <11, (9, 11, 14)>, <11, (1, 11, 14)>, <11, (11, 12, 14)>

- For node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
<12, (8, 11, 14)>

- For node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<14, (11, 16, 17)>, <14, (16, 17, 14)>, <14, (12, 14, 17)>, <14, (11, 14, 16)>

- For node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
<15, (0, 2, 18)>

- For node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
<17, (6, 8, 14)>, <17, (8, 14, 17)>, <17, (14, 16, 17)>, <17, (6, 17, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4+4+1+4+4+1+4+1+4+1+4+1+4] = 31\).
        
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 15, 16)>, <0, (4, 15, 0)>, <0, (1, 0, 4)>, <0, (15, 16, 14)>, <1, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (0, 6, 1)>, <1, (1, 8, 11)>, <1, (11, 9, 14)>, <3, (7, 9, 10)>, <3, (2, 15, 3)>, <3, (3, 7, 10)>, <3, (9, 11, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (6, 13, 4)>, <4, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (0, 13, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 17)>, <8, (1, 12, 17)>, <8, (1, 8, 12)>, <8, (5, 8, 17)>, <8, (8, 12, 14)>, <10, (3, 7, 13)>, <11, (1, 9, 12)>, <11, (9, 11, 14)>, <11, (1, 11, 14)>, <11, (11, 12, 14)>, <12, (8, 11, 14)>, <14, (11, 16, 17)>, <14, (16, 17, 14)>, <14, (12, 14, 17)>, <14, (11, 14, 16)>, <15, (0, 2, 18)>, <17, (6, 8, 14)>, <17, (8, 14, 17)>, <17, (14, 16, 17)>, <17, (6, 17, 8)>.
