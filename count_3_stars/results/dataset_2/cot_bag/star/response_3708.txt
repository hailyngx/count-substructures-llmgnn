Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
With 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 13, 6, 7, 0 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 9, 11, 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 11, 12, 0, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 10, 2 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 13, 0 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 13, 1, 3 (4 neighbors)
- Node 11 has neighbors: 5, 3, 14, 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 4, 2, 10, 0 (4 neighbors)
- Node 13 has neighbors: 9, 8, 2, 7, 0 (5 neighbors)
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 11, 4, 10 (4 neighbors)

Now, we'll find the number of 3-stars centered at each relevant node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (9, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (9, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (9, 8, 7)>
  - <1, (6, 8, 7)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (9, 13, 6)>
  - <2, (9, 13, 7)>
  - <2, (9, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (13, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (9, 13, 0)>
  - <2, (9, 6, 0)>
  - <2, (9, 7, 0)>
  - <2, (13, 6, 0)>
  - <2, (13, 7, 0)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 0)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (5, 9, 11)>
  - <3, (5, 9, 4)>
  - <3, (5, 11, 4)>
  - <3, (9, 11, 4)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (3, 11, 12)>
  - <4, (3, 11, 0)>
  - <4, (3, 11, 14)>
  - <4, (11, 12, 0)>
  - <4, (11, 12, 14)>
  - <4, (12, 0, 14)>
  - <4, (3, 12, 0)>
  - <4, (3, 12, 14)>
  - <4, (3, 0, 14)>
  - <4, (11, 0, 14)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 13, 1)>
  - <9, (2, 13, 3)>
  - <9, (2, 1, 3)>
  - <9, (13, 1, 3)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (2, 9, 7)>
  - <13, (2, 9, 0)>
  - <13, (2, 7, 0)>
  - <13, (9, 7, 0)>
  - <13, (2, 9, 8)>
  - <13, (2, 9, 13)>
  - <13, (2, 8, 13)>
  - <13, (9, 8, 13)>
  - <13, (7, 8, 13)>
  - <13, (2, 7, 8)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (3, 5, 14)>
  - <11, (3, 5, 4)>
  - <11, (3, 14, 4)>
  - <11, (5, 14, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [46]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (9, 6, 8)>
- <1, (9, 6, 7)>
- <1, (9, 8, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 7)>
