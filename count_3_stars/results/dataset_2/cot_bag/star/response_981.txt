Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 17) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 1) (12, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 13) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 13) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [45].
