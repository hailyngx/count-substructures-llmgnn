Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (21, 22) (5, 11) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 21) (18, 12) (22, 21) (22, 17) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 4) (25, 21) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 24) (13, 26) (13, 12) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 11) (0, 20) (0, 3) (15, 9) (6, 25) (6, 7) (28, 25) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 7) (23, 21) (23, 27) (2, 11) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 4) (10, 14) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 4) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 10) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (24, 25) (24, 29) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 11, 1, 21, 5, 9, 18, 22, 20, 25, 12, 27, 0, 15, 6, 28, 26, 29, 19, 23, 2, 10, 3, 17, 14, 7, 24, and 4.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes and then sum up the results:

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star formed with that node. If a node has more than 3 neighbors, the number of 3-stars is given by \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 11 has 5 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 21 has 5 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 18 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
7. Node 22 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
8. Node 20 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 25 has 5 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 12 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 27 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
13. Node 15 has 1 neighbor, no 3-star formed.
14. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
15. Node 28 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
16. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
17. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
18. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
19. Node 23 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
20. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
21. Node 10 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
22. Node 3 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
23. Node 17 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
24. Node 14 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
25. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
26. Node 24 has 2 neighbors, no 3-star formed.
27. Node 4 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].
