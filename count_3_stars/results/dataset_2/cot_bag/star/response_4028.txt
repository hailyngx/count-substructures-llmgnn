Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 14, 15)>, 
<2, (5, 11, 16)>, 
<7, (2, 11, 4)>, 
<10, (6, 13, 17)>, 
<11, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<12, (5, 18, 19)>, 
<13, (10, 17, 13)>, 
<14, (0, 9, 15)>, 
<15, (0, 14, 17)>, 
<16, (0, 18, 19)>, 
<17, (10, 13, 15)>, 
<18, (1, 12, 16)>, 
<19, (8, 12, 16)>.
