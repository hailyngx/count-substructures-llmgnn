Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29} have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of 45 3-stars [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 13, 29>
- <2, 18, 5>
- <3, 11, 23>
- <4, 28, 16>
- <5, 22, 24>
- <11, 23, 0>
- <16, 28, 4>
- <17, 28, 4>
- <19, 15, 29>
- <21, 8, 29>
- <24, 22, 5>
- <25, 11, 3>
- <26, 7, 1>
