Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine which nodes have at least 3 neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 0
Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 2, 1
Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, 1
Node 1: 5, 4, 7
Node 3: 9, 7, 0
Node 8: 4, 2, 0, 6
Node 6: 8, 2
Node 0: 9, 7, 3, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 60 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<9, (7, 5, 1)>
<9, (7, 4, 0)>
<9, (7, 0, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
