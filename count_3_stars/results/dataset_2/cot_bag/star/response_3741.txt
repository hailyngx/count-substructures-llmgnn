Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

From the given list of edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 17, 18, 19, 20)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 8, 15, 19, 22)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 5, 9, 23, 28)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 8, 17, 20)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 12, 13)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 16, 28)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 14, 17, 20)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 21, 24)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 5, 12, 23)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 13, 22, 29)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 4, 10, 27)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 4, 11, 20)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 7, 22, 28)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 1, 26)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 6, 24, 25)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 9, 18, 26, 29)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 0, 1, 25)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 13)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 1, 14, 22, 24)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 2, 5, 10)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 8, 16, 22)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 19, 25, 26)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 15, 18, 25)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 6, 14, 28)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 11, 18, 27)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43 \]

Therefore, there are 43 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is [43]. 
And some unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (17, 18, 19)>
<1, (8, 15, 22)>
<2, (5, 9, 23)>
<7, (14, 17, 20)>
<8, (1, 3, 21)>
<20, (0, 3, 13)>
<22, (1, 14, 24)>
<24, (8, 16, 22)>
<25, (19, 25, 26)>
