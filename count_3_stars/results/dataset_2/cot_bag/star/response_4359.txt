Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 0) (22, 24) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 25) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 2) (27, 4) (27, 25) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (6, 28) (6, 10) (28, 6) (17, 29) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 24) (9, 19) (9, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (4, 27) (4, 25) (26, 18) (26, 17) (26, 29) (26, 3) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 14) (25, 21) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 25) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 23) (8, 1) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 14) (14, 10) (14, 24) (14, 5) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 19) 

Response:
The central nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 11, 22
- Node 1: 8, 15, 21
- Node 2: 0, 11, 19
- Node 3: 13, 26
- Node 4: 25, 27
- Node 5: 14, 16, 20
- Node 6: 10, 28
- Node 7: 8, 11, 12
- Node 8: 1, 7, 18, 20, 24
- Node 9: 16, 19
- Node 10: 6, 14, 23
- Node 12: 7, 16, 18, 20
- Node 13: 3, 15
- Node 14: 5, 10, 24
- Node 16: 5, 9, 12, 19
- Node 17: 26, 29
- Node 18: 7, 8, 12, 26
- Node 19: 2, 9, 16, 23
- Node 20: 5, 8, 12
- Node 21: 1, 15, 23, 25
- Node 22: 0, 24
- Node 23: 10, 19, 21
- Node 24: 8, 14, 22, 29
- Node 25: 4, 11, 21, 27, 29
- Node 26: 3, 17, 18, 29
- Node 27: 4, 25
- Node 28: 6
- Node 29: 17, 24, 25, 26

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars and list the unique ones below:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [1]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 29: [1]
