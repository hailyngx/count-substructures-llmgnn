Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 10) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 9, 13) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 8, 13) --> 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 11, 12) --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 10, 13) --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 10, 11) --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (0, 8, 9, 13, 14) --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 10, 1) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (3, 10, 11, 12) --> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 61

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 10)> <0, (2, 6, 8)> <0, (2, 6, 10)> <0, (2, 8, 10)> <0, (8, 10, 13)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)> <1, (0, 5, 13)> <1, (5, 7, 9)> <1, (5, 9, 13)> <1, (7, 9, 13)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)> <2, (0, 6, 10)> <2, (6, 10, 14)> <2, (8, 10, 13)> <2, (10, 13, 14)>
<4, (8, 10, 13)> <4, (8, 10, 14)> <4, (10, 11, 14)> <4, (13, 10, 11)> <4, (13, 10, 14)>
