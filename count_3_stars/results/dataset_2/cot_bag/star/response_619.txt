Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 15) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 23) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 20) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 4) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 25) (2, 26) (2, 22) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 1) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 25) (27, 16) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 28) (1, 22) (1, 29) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 1) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 20) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 28) (16, 27) (17, 9) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 12) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 13) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 5 with neighbors {7, 6, 11, 15, 23}
- Node 6 with neighbors {5, 23, 25}
- Node 11 with neighbors {7, 5, 3, 23, 29}
- Node 13 with neighbors {3, 0, 4, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- <5, (7, 11, 15)>
- <5, (7, 11, 23)>
- <5, (7, 15, 23)>
- <5, (11, 15, 23)>
- <5, (6, 11, 23)>
- <5, (6, 15, 23)>
- <5, (7, 11, 5)>
- <5, (7, 11, 6)>
- <5, (7, 15, 5)>
- <5, (7, 15, 6)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <6, (5, 23, 25)>

For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- <11, (7, 5, 23)>
- <11, (7, 5, 29)>
- <11, (7, 15, 23)>
- <11, (7, 15, 29)>
- <11, (5, 3, 23)>
- <11, (5, 3, 29)>
- <11, (5, 23, 29)>
- <11, (7, 5, 11)>
- <11, (7, 5, 6)>
- <11, (7, 23, 29)>

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <13, (3, 0, 4)>
- <13, (3, 0, 28)>
- <13, (3, 4, 28)>
- <13, (0, 4, 28)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 (node 5) + 1 (node 6) + 10 (node 11) + 4 (node 13) = 25

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [25].
