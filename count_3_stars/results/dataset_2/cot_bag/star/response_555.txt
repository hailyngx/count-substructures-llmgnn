Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 24) (22, 3) (22, 23) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 6) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 27) (28, 9) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 11) (17, 16) (17, 2) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 11) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 4) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 21) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 8) (15, 13) (15, 9) (19, 29) (19, 9) (19, 4) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 18) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (14, 25) (14, 8) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 6) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (11, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars we get: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 51 \)

So, there are a total of [51] unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them below:
<2, (5, 2, 10)>
<4, (25, 4, 19)>
<5, (2, 5, 1)>
<7, (22, 7, 6)>
<9, (28, 9, 15)>
<10, (2, 10, 24)>
<11, (29, 11, 0)>
<12, (25, 12, 2)>
<16, (4, 16, 0)>
<16, (16, 4, 19)>
<16, (16, 17, 26)>
<16, (16, 27, 28)>
<18, (20, 18, 21)>
<19, (4, 19, 29)>
<21, (5, 21, 18)>
<22, (3, 22, 7)>
<24, (25, 24, 10)>
<25, (12, 25, 24)>
<27, (28, 27, 16)>
<29, (20, 29, 11)>
