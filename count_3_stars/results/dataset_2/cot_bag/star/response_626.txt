Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 4, and 2. Thus, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 0, and 8. The number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4, there are 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 0, and 5. The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 5, there are 6 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 7, 2, and 8. The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For nodes 6, 7, and 8, the number of 3-stars with each of them as the center is 0 since they only have 3 neighbors each.

Summing up the 3-stars from each central node, we get a total of \( [4 + 10 + 10 + 20] = [44] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 1, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
