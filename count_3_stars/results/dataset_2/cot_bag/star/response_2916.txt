The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 16) (26, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 16) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 11) (2, 18) (2, 23) (28, 14) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 3) (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (20, 7) (20, 14) (7, 20) (7, 19) (25, 29) (25, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 24) (0, 22) (0, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 12) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (19, 15) (19, 7) (13, 21) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 23) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 24) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, and 26.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {17, 22, 24}. So, there are [1] 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (17, 22, 24)>.
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {8, 11, 17, 26}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (8, 11, 17)>, <3, (8, 17, 27)>, <3, (11, 17, 27)>, <3, (17, 26, 29)>.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 10, 16, 24}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 10, 16)>, <4, (1, 16, 24)>, <4, (10, 16, 24)>, <4, (16, 24, 26)>.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {10, 22, 23, 25}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (10, 22, 23)>, <5, (10, 22, 25)>, <5, (10, 23, 25)>, <5, (22, 23, 5)>.
5. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {10, 11, 18}. So, there is [1] 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (10, 11, 18)>.
6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 8, 22}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (4, 5, 22)>, <10, (4, 8, 10)>, <10, (4, 8, 16)>, <10, (5, 22, 25)>.
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {13, 20, 28}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 14 as the center: <14, (13, 20, 28)>, <14, (13, 20, 14)>, <14, (13, 28, 24)>, <14, (20, 28, 24)>.
8. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {1, 19, 21}. So, there is [1] 3-star with node 15 as the center: <15, (1, 19, 21)>.
9. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {24, 4, 26}. So, there is [1] 3-star with node 16 as the center: <16, (4, 24, 26)>.
10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {0, 12, 27, 29}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 17 as the center: <17, (0, 12, 27)>, <17, (0, 12, 17)>, <17, (0, 27, 29)>, <17, (12, 27, 29)>.
11. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 22}. So, there is [1] 3-star with node 18 as the center: <18, (2, 8, 22)>.
12. Node 22 has 5 neighbors: {0, 5, 8, 10, 27}. So, there are [10] 3-stars with node 22 as the center: <22, (0, 5, 27)>, <22, (0, 8, 22)>, <22, (0, 8, 27)>, <22, (0, 10, 22)>, <22, (0, 10, 5)>, <22, (5, 8, 10)>, <22, (5, 8, 23)>, <22, (5, 10, 23)>, <22, (8, 10, 27)>, <22, (10, 27, 29)>.
13. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {3, 9, 16, 29}. So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 26 as the center: <26, (3, 16, 29)>, <26, (3, 26, 29)>, <26, (9, 16, 26)>, <26, (9, 26, 29)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
