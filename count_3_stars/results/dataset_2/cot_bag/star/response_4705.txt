Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 17, 6, 9.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 8, 18, 0.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 13, 16.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 8, 7, 12.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 15, 5, 4, 0.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 18, 12.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 11.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 14, 5, 1.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 1.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 7.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 14, 0, 2.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 2, 13, 7.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 14, 16, 11, 19.

Now we count the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 33 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [33]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (15, 17, 6)>
- <3, (15, 17, 9)>
- <3, (15, 6, 9)>
- <3, (17, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 13, 8)>
- <5, (6, 13, 18)>
- <5, (6, 13, 0)>
- <5, (6, 8, 18)>
- <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- <5, (13, 8, 18)>
- <5, (13, 8, 0)>
- <5, (8, 18, 0)>
- <6, (3, 5, 13)>
- <6, (3, 5, 16)>
- <6, (3, 13, 16)>
- <6, (5, 13, 16)>
- <14, (8, 7, 12)>
- <18, (5, 4, 0)>
- <7, (14, 16, 11)>
- <7, (14, 11, 19)>
- <7, (16, 11, 19)>
