Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up these, we get a total of 56 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
