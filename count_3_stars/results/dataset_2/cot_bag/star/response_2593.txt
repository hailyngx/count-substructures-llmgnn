Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (6, 14) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 10)>
<0, (5, 10, 1)>
<0, (10, 1, 5)>
<0, (18, 7, 16)>
<2, (4, 12, 18)>
<2, (12, 18, 4)>
<2, (18, 4, 12)>
<3, (12, 13, 17)>
<4, (2, 11, 19)>
<4, (11, 19, 2)>
<4, (19, 2, 11)>
<7, (10, 15, 18)>
<9, (0, 12, 16)>
<12, (2, 4, 14)>
<12, (4, 14, 2)>
<12, (14, 2, 4)>
<12, (9, 2, 12)>
<12, (9, 14, 4)>
<12, (9, 4, 14)>
<14, (2, 4, 6)>
<15, (2, 16, 18)>
