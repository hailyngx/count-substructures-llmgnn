The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, and 28.

<21, (0, 10, 11)>
<21, (0, 11, 21)>
<21, (10, 11, 21)>
<21, (10, 21, 0)>

Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

<28, (11, 13, 28)>
<28, (11, 21, 28)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we have a total of [61] 3-stars in the graph.
