Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 8, 13, 7, 12, 3, 11, 4, 14, 2, 1, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 112 \)

So, there are 112 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [112]. The unique 3-stars are: <6, (2, 4, 0)>, <8, (13, 12, 7)>, <13, (6, 8, 11)>, <7, (8, 12, 1)>, <12, (8, 13, 4)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>, <11, (9, 13, 3)>, <4, (6, 12, 2)>, <14, (3, 11, 4)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>, and <1, (9, 13, 7)>.
