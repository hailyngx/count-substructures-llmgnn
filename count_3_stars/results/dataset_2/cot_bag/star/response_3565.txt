Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 3) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 27) (15, 19) (15, 4) (20, 4) (29, 12) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (26, 6) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 29) (11, 3) (11, 25) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 1) (18, 8) (18, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 5) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 24) (21, 6) (21, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 16) (10, 16) (10, 19) (19, 15) (19, 10) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 21) (12, 14) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <0, (14, 16, 12)>, <0, (14, 16, 22)>, <0, (14, 16, 0)>, <0, (14, 12, 0)>
  
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <2, (9, 11, 21)>
  
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <3, (23, 11, 28)>
  
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <4, (15, 20, 27)>
  
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <6, (9, 21, 26)>
  
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <7, (9, 17, 25)>, <7, (9, 17, 7)>, <7, (9, 25, 7)>, <7, (17, 25, 7)>
  
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <8, (13, 26, 18)>, <8, (13, 26, 28)>, <8, (13, 18, 8)>, <8, (13, 28, 8)>
  
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <11, (29, 25, 3)>, <11, (29, 25, 11)>, <11, (29, 3, 11)>, <11, (25, 3, 11)>
  
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <12, (14, 29, 0)>
  
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <13, (8, 26, 18)>, <13, (8, 26, 28)>, <13, (8, 18, 13)>, <13, (8, 28, 13)>
  
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <14, (17, 23, 12)>, <14, (17, 23, 22)>, <14, (17, 23, 14)>, <14, (17, 12, 14)>
  
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <16, (22, 24, 10)>, <16, (22, 24, 16)>, <16, (22, 24, 16)>, <16, (22, 10, 16)>
  
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <17, (14, 23, 7)>, <17, (14, 23, 17)>, <17, (14, 7, 17)>, <17, (23, 7, 17)>
  
- Node 23: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <23, (3, 22, 7)>, <23, (3, 22, 17)>, <23, (3, 22, 23)>, <23, (3, 7, 23)>
  
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <24, (17, 25, 16)>, <24, (17, 25, 24)>, <24, (17, 16, 24)>, <24, (17, 16, 24)>
  
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <25, (7, 24, 11)>, <25, (7, 24, 25)>, <25, (7, 11, 25)>, <25, (7, 11, 25)>
  
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <26, (13, 28, 18)>, <26, (13, 28, 26)>, <26, (13, 18, 26)>, <26, (13, 18, 26)>
  
- Node 28: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <28, (1, 3, 8)>, <28, (1, 3, 13)>, <28, (1, 3, 18)>, <28, (1, 8, 13)>
  
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <29, (12, 14, 29)>
  
Adding them all up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 58

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
