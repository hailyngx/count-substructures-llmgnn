Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 6) (17, 3) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
First, let's see which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 10, 11, 8, 15
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 14, 1
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 7, 15, 18, 2
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 16, 14, 3
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 19, 2
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 15
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 12, 1, 18
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 11, 16, 19, 9
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 4, 18, 14

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
