Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 51 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (8, 11, 19)>, <1, (5, 7, 16)>, <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <4, (7, 13, 16)>, <5, (1, 7, 12)>, <7, (4, 5, 14)>, <8, (0, 2, 11)>, <9, (13, 17, 19)>, <12, (5, 14, 6)>, <13, (4, 8, 17)>, <14, (7, 11, 12)>, <17, (9, 13, 15)>.
