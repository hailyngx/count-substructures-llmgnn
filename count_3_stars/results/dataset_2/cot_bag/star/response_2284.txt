Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 20) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 22) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 23) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 21) (26, 24) (26, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 3) (1, 15) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 1) (27, 10) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 24) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 27) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (23, 28) (23, 14) (7, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (9, 16) (19, 28) (19, 4) (12, 18) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 5) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars they form.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms a total of \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 forms a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms a total of \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms a total of \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 46 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
