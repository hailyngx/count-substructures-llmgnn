Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 6) (28, 17) (4, 3) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 15) (14, 16) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 16) (26, 15) (26, 7) (7, 26) (7, 15) (7, 24) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 20) (9, 16) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 21) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 6) (10, 0) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 24) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 3) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 25) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 29) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 25, 27, 29.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 52 \]

Therefore, there are 52 total 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars: 
<13, (10, 16, 22)>, <14, (0, 15, 16)>, <15, (0, 14, 25)>, <16, (5, 13, 14)>, <17, (11, 18, 28)>, <18, (11, 17, 27)>, <23, (5, 11, 21)>, <25, (1, 15, 29)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
