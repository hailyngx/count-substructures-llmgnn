Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 5) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 0) (19, 1) (19, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \).  

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 14, 19)>, <3, (1, 11, 0)>, <3, (4, 11, 18)>, <3, (4, 11, 5)>, <3, (11, 18, 5)>, <3, (11, 18, 13)>, <3, (11, 5, 13)>, <6, (8, 18, 17)>, <8, (16, 15, 0)>, <10, (12, 7, 6)>, <11, (3, 18, 5)>, <12, (4, 14, 10)>, <13, (18, 5, 17)>, <14, (1, 4, 12)>, <15, (16, 7, 17)>, <16, (1, 8, 0)>, <17, (5, 15, 6)>, <17, (6, 15, 9)>, <17, (6, 17, 9)>, <17, (15, 6, 9)>, <19, (1, 8, 16)>
