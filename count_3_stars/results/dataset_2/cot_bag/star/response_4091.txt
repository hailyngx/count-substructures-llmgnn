Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

For node 2: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 4: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 6: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For node 7: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

For node 8: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

For node 9: 
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 
So, there are 20 unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding all the unique 3-stars together, we get:
\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [62] \]

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in total in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)> \]
