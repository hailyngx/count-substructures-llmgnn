Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node, we get:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52 3-stars in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [52], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>.
