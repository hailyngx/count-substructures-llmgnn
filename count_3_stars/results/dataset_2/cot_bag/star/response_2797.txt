Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
To begin, let's visualize the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {8}
- 1: {17, 16, 18}
- 2: {3, 5, 9}
- 3: {11, 2}
- 4: {9, 19, 11}
- 5: {2, 16}
- 6: {13, 10}
- 7: {12, 15, 19, 9}
- 8: {10, 17, 0}
- 9: {4, 7, 14, 2, 16}
- 10: {8, 6, 16, 18}
- 11: {4, 3, 18}
- 12: {7, 14}
- 13: {17, 15, 19, 6}
- 14: {12, 9}
- 15: {7, 13}
- 16: {1, 5, 9, 18, 10}
- 17: {1, 8, 13}
- 18: {11, 1, 16, 10}
- 19: {4, 7, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that are center nodes of 3-stars (i.e., nodes with three or more neighbors) and count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. We'll list the unique 3-stars as well.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: {9, 19, 11}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 19, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 14, 2, 16}
- Node 13: {17, 15, 19, 6}
- Node 16: {1, 5, 9, 18, 10}
- Node 18: {11, 1, 16, 10}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars:
- <4, (9, 19, 11)>
- <7, (12, 15, 19)>
- <7, (9, 14, 2)>
- <7, (9, 19, 4)>
- <9, (4, 7, 14)>
- <9, (7, 16, 2)>
- <13, (17, 15, 19)>
- <13, (19, 6, 7)>
- <16, (1, 5, 9)>
- <16, (9, 10, 18)>
- <18, (1, 10, 16)>
- <18, (10, 11, 16)>
