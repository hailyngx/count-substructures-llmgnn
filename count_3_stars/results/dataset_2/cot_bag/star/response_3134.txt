Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 15) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 18) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 16) (16, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36 \)

So, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars that form in this graph:

<0, (14, 18, 0)>, <4, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 5, 17)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <10, (12, 10, 13)>, <11, (5, 11, 9)>, <12, (10, 12, 0)>, <13, (10, 13, 18)>, <14, (7, 14, 0)>, <17, (3, 17, 4)>, <18, (13, 18, 10)>, <19, (7, 19, 18)>
