Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 24) (13, 0) (22, 0) (22, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 26) (20, 5) (25, 19) (8, 4) (8, 18) (8, 27) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 17) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 16) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 16) (28, 0) (28, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 24) (12, 14) (5, 20) (5, 2) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 23) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 2) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 11) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 14) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 11) (6, 19) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 23) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors (13, 22, 28)
- Node 2: neighbors (5, 14, 16, 9)
- Node 3: neighbors (22, 4, 1, 26)
- Node 6: neighbors (19, 27, 14, 23)
- Node 7: neighbors (12, 15, 27)
- Node 8: neighbors (4, 18, 27)
- Node 10: neighbors (26, 24, 23)
- Node 12: neighbors (7, 17, 24, 14)
- Node 13: neighbors (21, 24, 0)
- Node 14: neighbors (1, 12, 2, 6)
- Node 15: neighbors (7, 18, 16)
- Node 16: neighbors (29, 15, 21, 2)
- Node 17: neighbors (26, 29, 12)
- Node 18: neighbors (1, 8, 15, 28)
- Node 21: neighbors (13, 26, 16, 11)
- Node 22: neighbors (0, 3, 4)
- Node 24: neighbors (13, 12, 10)
- Node 26: neighbors (3, 10, 21, 17)
- Node 27: neighbors (7, 8, 29, 6)
- Node 29: neighbors (17, 27, 16)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars: [1]
2. Node 2 forms 3-stars: [1]
3. Node 3 forms 3-stars: [1]
4. Node 6 forms 3-stars: [1]
5. Node 7 forms 3-stars: [1]
6. Node 8 forms 3-stars: [1]
7. Node 10 forms 3-stars: [1]
8. Node 12 forms 3-stars: [1]
9. Node 13 forms 3-stars: [1]
10. Node 14 forms 3-stars: [1]
11. Node 15 forms 3-stars: [1]
12. Node 16 forms 3-stars: [1]
13. Node 17 forms 3-stars: [1]
14. Node 18 forms 3-stars: [1]
15. Node 21 forms 3-stars: [1]
16. Node 22 forms 3-stars: [1]
17. Node 24 forms 3-stars: [1]
18. Node 26 forms 3-stars: [1]
19. Node 27 forms 3-stars: [1]
20. Node 29 forms 3-stars: [1]

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, the total number is [20].

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (13, 22, 28)>, <2, (5, 14, 16, 9)>, <3, (22, 4, 1, 26)>, <6, (19, 27, 14, 23)>, <7, (12, 15, 27)>, <8, (4, 18, 27)>, <10, (26, 24, 23)>, <12, (7, 17, 24, 14)>, <13, (21, 24, 0)>, <14, (1, 12, 2, 6)>, <15, (7, 18, 16)>, <16, (29, 15, 21, 2)>, <17, (26, 29, 12)>, <18, (1, 8, 15, 28)>, <21, (13, 26, 16, 11)>, <22, (0, 3, 4)>, <24, (13, 12, 10)>, <26, (3, 10, 21, 17)>, <27, (7, 8, 29, 6)>, <29, (17, 27, 16)>.
