Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Looking at the list of edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 3, 2} (degree = 4)
- Node 1: {9, 3, 6} (degree = 3)
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 3, 0} (degree = 5)
- Node 3: {9, 1, 0, 6, 2, 8} (degree = 6)
- Node 4: {9, 7, 0} (degree = 3)
- Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 7} (degree = 4)
- Node 6: {5, 1, 3} (degree = 3)
- Node 7: {5, 4, 0, 2} (degree = 4)
- Node 8: {5, 9, 3} (degree = 3)
- Node 9: {8, 4, 2, 3, 1} (degree = 5)

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node. For nodes with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of 54 3-stars in the graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [54].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (4, 7, 3)> 
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
