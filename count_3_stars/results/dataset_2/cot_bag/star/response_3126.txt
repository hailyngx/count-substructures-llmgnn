Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 13) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 15) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (9, 10, 19)>
  - <6, (9, 10, 16)>
  - <6, (9, 19, 16)>
  - <6, (10, 19, 16)>

- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <8, (7, 4, 19)>
  - <8, (7, 4, 14)>
  - <8, (7, 19, 14)>
  - <8, (4, 19, 14)>
  - <8, (4, 14, 1)>
  - <8, (19, 14, 1)>
  - <8, (19, 1, 13)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 13)>
  - <8, (14, 13, 1)>
  - <8, (1, 13, 1)>

- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <11, (2, 0, 3)>
  - <11, (2, 0, 5)>
  - <11, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <11, (2, 3, 5)>

- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <13, (18, 4, 1)>
  - <13, (18, 4, 3)>
  - <13, (18, 4, 10)>
  - <13, (18, 1, 10)>
  - <13, (4, 1, 10)>
  - <13, (4, 3, 10)>
  - <13, (1, 3, 10)>
  - <13, (1, 10, 1)>
  - <13, (3, 10, 1)>
  - <13, (3, 1, 13)>

- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <15, (18, 0, 19)>
  - <15, (18, 0, 10)>
  - <15, (18, 19, 10)>
  - <15, (0, 19, 10)>

- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <16, (6, 7, 4)>
  - <16, (6, 7, 19)>
  - <16, (6, 4, 19)>
  - <16, (7, 4, 19)>

- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <18, (5, 12, 15)>
  - <18, (5, 12, 14)>
  - <18, (5, 14, 15)>
  - <18, (12, 14, 15)>

- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <19, (6, 8, 15)>
  - <19, (6, 8, 16)>
  - <19, (6, 15, 16)>
  - <19, (8, 15, 16)>

Total number of 3-stars: [40]
