Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in the given graph.

This can be represented as: [45]

And the unique 3-stars are:
