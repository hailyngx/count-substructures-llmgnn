Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (8, 9) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 5) (17, 15) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 11) (12, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (6, 15, 18, 19), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (6, 10, 15, 6), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 9, 17), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 13, 5), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (6, 9, 15, 16, 19), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 19, 7), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (1, 12, 16), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 17, 1), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (7, 11, 18), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 13, 16), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors (0, 7, 13, 14, 9), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [62] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (6, 18, 19)>
