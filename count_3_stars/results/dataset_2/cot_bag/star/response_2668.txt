Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 14)
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 13)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 14)
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 12)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 14)
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 10), (6, 13)
- Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 12), (7, 13)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 12), (9, 13)
- Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 11)
- Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 9), (12, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 2), (13, 6), (13, 7), (13, 9)
- Node 14: (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 5)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <1, (0, 4, 14)>
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <2, (6, 7, 13)>
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <5, (0, 8, 14)>
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <6, (0, 2, 13)>
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <7, (2, 8, 13)>
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <9, (0, 3, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [60]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 60.
