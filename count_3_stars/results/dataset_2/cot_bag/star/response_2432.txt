Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 16) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (12, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 1) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 11) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 24) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 15) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 3) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 10) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 6) (16, 12) (29, 3) (29, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 25) (28, 18) (28, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 29) (7, 1) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 7) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (19, 27) (19, 3) (15, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: 1 3-star
For node 4: 1 3-star
For node 9: 1 3-star
For node 10: 1 3-star
For node 11: 3 3-stars
For node 13: 1 3-star
For node 16: 1 3-star
For node 17: 1 3-star
For node 18: 3 3-stars
For node 21: 3 3-stars
For node 22: 1 3-star
For node 23: 3 3-stars
For node 24: 1 3-star
For node 25: 3 3-stars
For node 26: 3 3-stars
For node 29: 1 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].
