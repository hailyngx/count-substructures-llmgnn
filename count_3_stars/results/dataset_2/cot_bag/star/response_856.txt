Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 0) (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 23) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 6) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (6, 11) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 7) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 12) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 23) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 18) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 28) (24, 1) (16, 29) (16, 5) (18, 7) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 2) (23, 27) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 20) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (21, 15, 24)>, <1, (21, 15, 23)>, <1, (15, 3, 17)>, <1, (15, 9, 29)>.

Node 15 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <15, (1, 3, 9)>, <15, (1, 9, 17)>, <15, (1, 9, 29)>, <15, (1, 17, 29)>, <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 29)>, <15, (3, 17, 29)>, <15, (9, 17, 29)>, <15, (10, 17, 29)>, <15, (10, 11, 17)>, <15, (10, 11, 29)>, <15, (10, 17, 11)>, <15, (10, 11, 16)>, <15, (11, 17, 29)>, <15, (11, 16, 29)>, <15, (17, 11, 29)>, <15, (17, 11, 16)>, <15, (11, 6, 29)>, <15, (11, 6, 17)>, <15, (11, 6, 10)>.

Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <10, (11, 8, 17)>, <10, (11, 8, 6)>, <10, (8, 28, 9)>, <10, (8, 9, 5)>.

Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (10, 8, 17)>, <11, (10, 8, 6)>, <11, (17, 6, 29)>, <11, (17, 6, 16)>.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (21, 26, 13)>, <0, (26, 8, 7)>, <0, (26, 8, 20)>, <0, (13, 20, 26)>.

Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <28, (21, 8, 9)>, <28, (21, 8, 12)>, <28, (21, 9, 12)>, <28, (8, 9, 26)>.

Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <29, (15, 16, 25)>, <29, (15, 16, 5)>, <29, (15, 25, 23)>, <29, (16, 5, 25)>.

Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <22, (3, 19, 6)>, <22, (2, 6, 19)>, <22, (2, 6, 27)>, <22, (19, 5, 7)>.

Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <26, (0, 8, 7)>, <26, (20, 8, 7)>, <26, (20, 13, 0)>, <26, (13, 20, 0)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 44 3-stars in this graph: [44].
