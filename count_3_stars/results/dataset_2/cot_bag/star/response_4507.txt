Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 18) (7, 29) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 20) (1, 2) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 14) (26, 25) (26, 2) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 4) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 4) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 26) (4, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 3) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 8) (16, 2) (16, 23) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 15) (5, 25) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 22) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 16) (19, 29) (19, 10) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 3, 25, 18, 2, 1, 26, 17, 29, 20, 7, 24, 5, 11, 14, 12, 8, 23, 10, and 22.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 66

Hence, there are 66 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [66]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
