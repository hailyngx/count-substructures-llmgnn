Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 4.

Next, we'll determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms one 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 7.
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 2, 8, and 1, and one with nodes 9, 7, and 1.
- Node 8 forms one 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 forms one 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 4.

Counting up the 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars. Listing them inside <>:
<1, (6, 8, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>
