Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 1) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 11) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 13) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (19, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (2, 4, 16)>, <0, (2, 4, 1)>, <0, (4, 16, 9)>, <0, (1, 16, 9)>

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (0, 14, 18)>, <1, (5, 14, 18)>, <1, (0, 5, 14)>, <1, (0, 5, 1)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (0, 11, 13)>, <4, (0, 11, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 13)>, <4, (0, 13, 12)>, <4, (11, 17, 13)>, <4, (11, 17, 7)>, <4, (6, 11, 13)>, <4, (13, 12, 6)>, <4, (11, 7, 18)>, <4, (11, 13, 18)>

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<5, (1, 13, 17)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (2, 10, 11)>, <7, (2, 10, 18)>, <7, (11, 17, 4)>, <7, (11, 18, 4)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (14, 16, 18)>

For node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (4, 7, 17)>, <11, (4, 13, 7)>, <11, (7, 17, 10)>, <11, (7, 17, 18)>

For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<13, (4, 5, 6)>, <13, (4, 6, 12)>, <13, (4, 12, 6)>, <13, (5, 1, 17)>, <13, (5, 1, 7)>, <13, (5, 17, 19)>, <13, (1, 17, 19)>, <13, (4, 6, 18)>, <13, (4, 12, 18)>, <13, (6, 12, 18)>

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<14, (1, 9, 15)>

For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<16, (0, 3, 9)>

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<17, (5, 11, 13)>, <17, (5, 13, 19)>, <17, (11, 13, 7)>, <17, (13, 12, 19)>

For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<18, (4, 6, 7)>, <18, (4, 6, 13)>, <18, (4, 7, 9)>, <18, (4, 7, 11)>, <18, (6, 7, 13)>, <18, (6, 7, 1)>, <18, (6, 13, 1)>, <18, (7, 9, 16)>, <18, (7, 9, 14)>, <18, (7, 11, 17)>

Now, summing up all the 3-stars gives a total of 43 3-stars in this graph: [43].
