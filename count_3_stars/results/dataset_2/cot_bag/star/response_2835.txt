Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 9) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 15) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, we will draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges.

```
  4 -- 1 -- 10 -- 6 -- 17
  |         |     |    |
  9 -- 15 -- 14 -- 3    16  
  |         |     |        
  5 -- 19 -- 18 -- 7 -- 8 -- 13 -- 0                                           
                            |
                            12
```

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 13, 18), hence it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (5, 14, 16), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (10, 17, 2), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (8, 9, 10, 18), hence it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (7, 12, 13), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (10, 15, 19), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 7), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (14, 8, 0), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (2, 15, 13, 3, 17), hence it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 11), hence it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 12, 19), hence it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 18, 2), hence it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<7, (8, 9, 10)>, <18, (0, 5, 19)>, <18, (0, 7, 12)>, <18, (0, 12, 5)>, <18, (5, 12, 19)>, <18, (5, 12, 0)>, <18, (7, 9, 10)>, <18, (7, 10, 12)>, <18, (12, 5, 19)>, <18, (12, 18, 19)>, <19, (2, 9, 18)>, <14, (2, 15, 9)>, <14, (2, 17, 6)>, <14, (3, 5, 19)>, <14, (3, 16, 11)>, <14, (3, 16, 16)>, <14, (3, 16, 3)>, <14, (3, 16, 5)>, <14, (5, 16, 3)>, <14, (5, 16, 5)>, <14, (17, 6, 14)>, <14, (17, 17, 6)>, <14, (17, 17, 14)>, <14, (17, 17, 17)>, <14, (17, 17, 3)>, <14, (17, 17, 5)>, <14, (17, 14, 3)>, <14, (17, 14, 5)>, <14, (17, 14, 17)>, <14, (17, 3, 16)>, <14, (17, 3, 3)>, <14, (17, 3, 5)>, <14, (17, 5, 16)>, <14, (17, 5, 3)>, <14, (17, 5, 5)>, <14, (14, 3, 5)>, <14, (14, 15, 9)>, <14, (14, 3, 16)>, <14, (14, 3, 3)>, <1...
