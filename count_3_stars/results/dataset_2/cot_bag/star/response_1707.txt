Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 18) (22, 11) (9, 29) (9, 25) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 10) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 15) (2, 18) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 17) (24, 3) (24, 10) (24, 23) (26, 11) (26, 3) (15, 21) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 25) (12, 0) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 8) (28, 3) (28, 20) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 27) (23, 24) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 19) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 10) (14, 23) (14, 25) (0, 12) (0, 19) (11, 22) (11, 21) (11, 26) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 19) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 23) (19, 0) (19, 10) (20, 28) (20, 27) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the potential 3-stars. 
Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 3 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 4 : 5 neighbors  
- Node 7 : 3 neighbors  
- Node 8 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 10 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 11 : 3 neighbors  
- Node 12 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 13 : 3 neighbors  
- Node 16 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 17 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 18 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 19 : 5 neighbors  
- Node 21 : 3 neighbors  
- Node 23 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 25 : 4 neighbor  
- Node 26 : 3 neighbors  
- Node 27 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 28 : 4 neighbors  
- Node 29 : 3 neighbors  

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star for each node.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars for each node.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars for each node.

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars:  
$1\cdot2 + 4\cdot5 + 10\cdot3 = 2 + 20 + 30 = 52$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (4, 24, 26)>
- <4, (8, 12, 16)>
- <7, (21, 19, 27)>
- <8, (1, 4, 28)>
- <10, (18, 19, 25)>
- <12, (4, 13, 25)>
- <13, (12, 17, 19)>
- <16, (4, 15, 17)>
- <17, (13, 16, 29)>
- <18, (2, 10, 22)>
- <19, (0, 10, 23)>
- <21, (11, 15, 7)>
- <23, (5, 14, 24)>
- <25, (9, 10, 14)>
- <26, (11, 3, 21)>
- <27, (5, 7, 20)>
- <28, (3, 20, 8)>
- <29, (8, 17, 9)>
