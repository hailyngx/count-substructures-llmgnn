Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13. Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 0: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 9, 14, 2), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <0, (1, 9, 14)>, <0, (1, 9, 2)>, <0, (1, 14, 2)>, <0, (9, 14, 2)>

2. For node 1: This node has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 10, 13), so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 10)>, <1, (0, 2, 13)>, <1, (0, 3, 10)>, <1, (0, 3, 13)>, <1, (0, 10, 13)>, <1, (2, 3, 10)>, <1, (2, 3, 13)>, <1, (2, 10, 13)>, <1, (3, 10, 13)>

3. For node 2: This node has 5 neighbors (1, 0, 6, 8, 12), so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. <2, (1, 0, 6)>, <2, (1, 0, 8)>, <2, (1, 0, 12)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 12)>, <2, (1, 8, 12)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 12)>, <2, (0, 8, 12)>, <2, (6, 8, 12)>

4. For node 3: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 8, 10, 11), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <3, (1, 8, 11)>, <3, (1, 10, 11)>, <3, (8, 10, 11)>

5. For node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (9, 13, 7, 14), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <5, (9, 13, 7)>, <5, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (9, 7, 14)>, <5, (13, 7, 14)>

6. For node 7: This node has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 8, 12, 11), so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 11)>, <7, (5, 8, 12)>, <7, (5, 8, 11)>, <7, (5, 12, 11)>, <7, (9, 8, 12)>, <7, (9, 8, 11)>, <7, (9, 12, 11)>, <7, (8, 12, 11)>

7. For node 8: This node has 5 neighbors (3, 13, 4, 2, 7), so we have [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. <8, (3, 13, 4)>, <8, (3, 13, 2)>, <8, (3, 13, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 2)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 2, 7)>, <8, (13, 4, 2)>, <8, (13, 4, 7)>, <8, (13, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>

8. For node 9: This node has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 0, 1), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 0, 1)>, <9, (7, 0, 1)>

9. For node 10: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 0), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <10, (1, 3, 4)>, <10, (1, 3, 0)>, <10, (1, 4, 0)>, <10, (3, 4, 0)>

10. For node 11: This node has 4 neighbors (3, 13, 6, 7), so we have [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. <11, (3, 13, 6)>, <11, (3, 13, 7)>, <11, (3, 6, 7)>, <11, (13, 6, 7)>

11. For node 13: This node has 6 neighbors (5, 1, 8, 12, 11, 6), so we have [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars. <13, (5, 1, 8)>, <13, (5, 1, 12)>, <13, (5, 1, 11)>, <13, (5, 1, 6)>, <13, (5, 8, 12)>, <13, (5, 8, 11)>, <13, (5, 8, 6)>, <13, (5, 12, 11)>, <13, (5, 12, 6)>, <13, (5, 11, 6)>, <13, (1, 8, 12)>, <13, (1, 8, 11)>, <13, (1, 8, 6)>, <13, (1, 12, 11)>, <13, (1, 12, 6)>, <13, (1, 11, 6)>, <13, (8, 12, 11)>, <13, (8, 12, 6)>, <13, (8, 11, 6)>, <13, (12, 11, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 80. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
