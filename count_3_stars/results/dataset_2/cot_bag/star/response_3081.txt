Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70 \)

So, there are a total of 70 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [70].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 13)>
<0, (4, 13, 14)>
<0, (6, 14, 9)>
<0, (13, 11, 5)>
<2, (4, 11, 13)>
<5, (2, 11, 13)>
<5, (8, 10, 6)>
<8, (1, 7, 6)>
<10, (7, 8, 6)>
<13, (1, 11, 2)>
