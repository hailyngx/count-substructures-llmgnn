Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) 

Response:
There are few nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, 13
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8, 12
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 14
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 11, 0
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 10, 12
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 10, 0
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 13
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 12, 13
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 12
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 12
Node 12 has 6 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8
Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 3, 12

Now we can find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 8 contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 12 contributes inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 88

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars present in the graph is [88]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 13)>
<0, (1, 8, 13)>
<0, (4, 7, 13)>
<0, (4, 8, 13)>
<0, (6, 7, 13)>
<0, (6, 8, 13)>
<2, (3, 8, 12)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<2, (5, 7, 12)>
<3, (2, 8, 14)>
<4, (1, 7, 10)>
<4, (1, 11, 12)>
<4, (7, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<5, (2, 6, 12)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<7, (2, 3, 13)>
<8, (0, 3, 13)>
<8, (0, 2, 13)>
<8, (0, 12, 13)>
<12, (2, 11, 14)>
