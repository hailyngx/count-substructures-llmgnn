Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 7) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (4, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 31 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<11, (14, 18, 6)>, <11, (14, 18, 7)>, <11, (14, 18, 2)>, <11, (14, 18, 1)>, <11, (16, 0, 3)>, <14, (11, 17, 8)>, <14, (11, 17, 1)>, <14, (11, 17, 8)>, <14, (11, 17, 1)>, <14, (17, 8, 2)>, <14, (17, 8, 4)>, <14, (17, 8, 1)>, <14, (17, 8, 12)>, <14, (17, 8, 4)>, <14, (17, 8, 12)>, <14, (17, 8, 12)>, <14, (5, 10, 0)>, <14, (5, 10, 1)>, <14, (5, 10, 2)>, <14, (17, 1, 8)>, <8, (14, 17, 1)>, <8, (14, 17, 12)>, <8, (14, 17, 4)>, <8, (14, 17, 12)>, <8, (14, 17, 4)>, <8, (14, 17, 12)>, <8, (14, 17, 4)>, <8, (14, 17, 12)>, <8, (14, 17, 4)>
