Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (8, 10) (8, 6) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (15, 12) (15, 9) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 17) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with three or more neighbors, which we'll consider potential center nodes for 3-stars.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 14, 16)>
<2, (5, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 9, 13)>
<5, (6, 16, 19)>
<6, (4, 8, 16)>
<7, (0, 6, 12)>
<9, (1, 4, 15)>
<12, (7, 15, 18)>
<14, (1, 11, 13)>
<16, (5, 6, 19)>
