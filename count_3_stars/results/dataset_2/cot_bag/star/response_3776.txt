Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 11) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Let's count the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 \)

With a total of 56 3-stars, the list is as follows:
<1, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (5, 7, 12)>, <1, (0, 5, 12)>, <1, (0, 5, 10)>, <1, (0, 3, 12)>, <1, (0, 3, 11)>, <1, (5, 6, 13)>, <1, (5, 2, 14)>, <1, (5, 12, 1)>, <2, (7, 5, 2)>, <2, (7, 5, 14)>, <2, (5, 12, 11)>, <3, (8, 7, 12)>, <3, (8, 7, 10)>, <3, (8, 7, 2)>, <3, (8, 13, 6)>, <3, (8, 13, 9)>, <3, (8, 13, 1)>, <3, (8, 10, 0)>, <3, (0, 14, 9)>, <3, (0, 14, 2)>, <3, (14, 9, 11)>, <5, (6, 4, 1)>, <5, (2, 7, 10)>, <5, (12, 7, 8)>, <5, (12, 7, 1)>, <5, (12, 3, 11)>, <6, (4, 1, 13)>, <7, (12, 5, 1)>, <7, (10, 8, 3)>, <8, (7, 2, 11)>, <8, (10, 7, 5)>, <8, (10, 7, 0)>, <9, (11, 13, 1)>, <9, (2, 14, 0)>, <10, (7, 12, 8)>, <10, (5, 2, 14)>, <11, (9, 14, 2)>, <12, (7, 8, 3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].
