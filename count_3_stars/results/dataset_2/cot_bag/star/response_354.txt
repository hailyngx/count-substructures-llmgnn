Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 0, 3, and 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
