Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 14) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 13) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (2, 15, 17)>
<5, (2, 13, 15)>
<5, (15, 17, 19)>
<5, (13, 15, 19)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (0, 7, 19)>
<9, (7, 8, 19)>
<9, (17, 19, 0)>
<9, (8, 17, 19)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (As it has only two neighbors)

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<13, (3, 11, 16)>
<13, (11, 16, 18)>
<13, (5, 11, 16)>
<13, (5, 16, 18)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (4, 16, 18)>
<14, (4, 16, 13)>
<14, (16, 13, 14)>
<14, (16, 13, 19)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (As it has only one neighbor)

- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<16, (13, 14, 19)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<18, (2, 16, 11)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<19, (0, 16, 5)>
<19, (0, 6, 16)>
<19, (5, 6, 19)>
<19, (5, 6, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
