Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 15) (17, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 10) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 6) (12, 3) (12, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 2, 13)>, <0, (1, 13, 17)>, <0, (1, 4, 16)>, <0, (2, 4, 16)>

For node 2: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<2, (0, 6, 16)>

For node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<3, (11, 12, 15)>

For node 4: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<5, (7, 9, 16)>

For node 6: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (2, 8, 18)>

For node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (11, 15, 18)>, <8, (11, 18, 6)>, <8, (11, 18, 10)>, <8, (15, 6, 18)>

For node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (13, 18, 10)>

For node 10: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<10, (13, 16, 18)>, <10, (13, 19, 18)>, <10, (16, 19, 10)>, <10, (16, 18, 10)>

For node 11: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<11, (3, 8, 18)>

For node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (0, 10, 17)>, <13, (9, 10, 18)>, <13, (9, 13, 17)>, <13, (10, 16, 18)>

For node 15: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (3, 17, 19)>, <15, (8, 17, 19)>, <15, (8, 11, 15)>, <15, (17, 19, 15)>

For node 16: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<16, (5, 10, 2)>, <16, (5, 4, 10)>, <16, (5, 9, 2)>, <16, (9, 10, 18)>

For node 18: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<18, (6, 8, 10)>, <18, (10, 11, 6)>, <18, (10, 13, 9)>, <18, (10, 16, 19)>, <18, (11, 13, 8)>, <18, (11, 15, 8)>, <18, (11, 8, 6)>, <18, (13, 15, 9)>, <18, (15, 8, 18)>, <18, (16, 19, 10)>

For node 19: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<19, (12, 15, 3)>, <19, (12, 15, 17)>, <19, (12, 3, 1)>, <19, (15, 17, 19)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 38 3-stars in the graph.
So, the answer is [38].
