Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 6) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: Neighbors [1, 2, 10, 12, 13]
Node 1: Neighbors [0, 3, 11, 12]
Node 2: Neighbors [0, 4, 5, 7]
Node 4: Neighbors [2, 5, 6, 10, 14]
Node 5: Neighbors [2, 4, 9, 14]
Node 7: Neighbors [2, 8, 9, 10]
Node 8: Neighbors [7, 9, 12, 14]
Node 9: Neighbors [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
Node 10: Neighbors [0, 4, 6, 7, 9]
Node 12: Neighbors [0, 1, 8, 9]

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
Node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 4: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 9: ${7 \choose 3} = 35$
Node 10: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
Node 12: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 4 = 85$

Therefore, there are 85 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<> [1, (0, 2, 10)]
<> [2, (0, 4, 5)]
<> [4, (2, 5, 14)]
<> [5, (2, 4, 9)]
<> [7, (2, 9, 10)]
<> [8, (7, 9, 12)]
<> [9, (4, 5, 14)]
<> [10, (4, 6, 7)]
<> [12, (0, 1, 8)]
<> [1, (0, 11, 12)]
<> [6, (4, 10, 13)]
<> [14, (4, 8, 11)]
