Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 2) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 5) (0, 23) (0, 20) (0, 11) (20, 0) (20, 28) (28, 14) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 15) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 26) (19, 3) (19, 6) (26, 19) (26, 13) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 23) (6, 19) (6, 13) (21, 27) (16, 28) (16, 7) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 28) (7, 29) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 1) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 7) (24, 17) (25, 9) (25, 4) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 18) (18, 10) (18, 27) (3, 29) (3, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 28, and 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are 66 3-stars in this graph. 
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [66]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 11)>, <1, (0, 7, 11)>, <1, (4, 7, 11)>, <4, (0, 7, 11)>, <5, (0, 22, 23)>, <9, (15, 25, 28)>, <10, (15, 17, 28)>, <14, (0, 11, 17)>, <17, (10, 24, 27)>, <19, (6, 13, 26)>, <20, (0, 28, 29)>, <22, (5, 8, 23)>, <23, (0, 1, 6)>, <28, (15, 16, 29)>, <29, (3, 7, 28)>
