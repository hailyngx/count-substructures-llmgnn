Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 7) (7, 12) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 13) (0, 22) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 5) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 26) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 15) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 4) (29, 9) (29, 11) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (22, 10) (22, 19) (18, 29) (18, 15) (19, 22) (19, 11) (25, 9) (25, 6) (11, 29) (11, 19) (11, 24) (11, 26) (24, 16) (24, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 25) (6, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 14) (23, 5) (26, 16) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 21) (3, 27) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (21, 5) (21, 26) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges into a more readable format:

- Node 0 is connected to node 22.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 16, and 28.
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 20, and 27.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 13, and 28.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 20, 21, and 23.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 25, and 26.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 13, and 27.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 22.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 25, and 29.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 20, and 22.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 19, 24, and 26.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 16.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 20, and 23.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18 and 28.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 13, and 24.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8 and 20.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 29, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11 and 22.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 10, 14, and 17.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 5 and 26.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 10.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 5 and 14.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 11 and 16.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 21, and 26.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 12.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 15, and 16.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 9 and 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28 \]

Therefore, there are 28 different 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (1, 7, 13)>, 
<4, (7, 13, 16)>,
<4, (7, 28, 16)>,
