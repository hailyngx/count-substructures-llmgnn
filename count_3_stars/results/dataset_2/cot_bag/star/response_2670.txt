Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 6) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 24) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 17) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 24) (29, 10) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (20, 26) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 28) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 20) (26, 9) (26, 27) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 5) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (19, 28) (19, 10) (19, 16) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 18) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (12, 25) (12, 28) (10, 29) (10, 19) (10, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 6) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 18) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we'll identify and count the 3-stars formed around those nodes.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (17, 23, 29)>.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 23)>.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (4, 24, 25)>.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (8, 21, 26)>.

Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <16, (2, 8, 19)>.

Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <21, (9, 11, 22)>.

Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <22, (9, 13, 21)>.

Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <23, (1, 4, 28)>.

Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <25, (1, 7, 12)>.

Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <28, (12, 18, 23)>.

Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <29, (2, 10, 24)>.

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
