Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, and 18.

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we find the following number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 67 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 18)>, <0, (1, 10, 15)>, <0, (1, 15, 19)>, <0, (3, 14, 18)>, <0, (5, 10, 18)>, <0, (10, 12, 18)>, <0, (15, 19, 12)>, <0, (15, 19, 13)>, <0, (18, 13, 19)>, <1, (0, 15, 16)>, <2, (3, 8, 17)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (7, 14, 15)>, <7, (10, 14, 5)>, <8, (2, 10, 14)>, <10, (0, 12, 18)>, <14, (3, 5, 7)>, <15, (1, 5, 19)>, <18, (0, 10, 11)>, <18, (11, 13, 5)>
