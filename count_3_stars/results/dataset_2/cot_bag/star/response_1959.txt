Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 2
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 6
- Node 2: 5, 8, 6, 0
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 6
- Node 4: 9, 8, 0, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 1, 0
- Node 6: 5, 7, 1, 3, 2
- Node 7: 3, 6, 1
- Node 8: 9, 4, 2, 3, 1
- Node 9: 5, 8, 4

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Adding these up we get a total of 47 unique 3-stars:
\[ [47] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 4, 2)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 6)>
- <1, (5, 8, 6)>
- <1, (7, 8, 6)>
- <2, (5, 8, 6)>
- <3, (4, 8, 3)>
- <4, (9, 8, 4)>
- <5, (9, 6, 5)>
- <6, (5, 7, 6)>
- <6, (5, 8, 6)>
- <6, (7, 8, 6)>
- <8, (9, 4, 8)>
- <10, (5, 7, 6)>
- <10, (5, 6, 2)>
- <10, (7, 8, 6)>
