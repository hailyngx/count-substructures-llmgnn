Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 \]

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 56, which can be written as [56].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:    
<0, (2, 5, 8)>    
<2, (0, 5, 7)>    
<3, (2, 6, 9)>    
<4, (0, 7, 8)>    
<5, (0, 6, 8)>    
<6, (3, 5, 7)>    
<7, (0, 5, 8)>    
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
