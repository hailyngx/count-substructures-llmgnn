Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 26) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 26) (8, 25) (8, 0) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 27) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 9) (28, 11) (28, 19) (5, 21) (5, 27) (13, 21) (20, 23) (20, 22) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 19) (1, 17) (1, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 25) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 1) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 2) (6, 23) (6, 29) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 22) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 21) (29, 14) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 29) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (10, 18) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 10) (2, 15) (2, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three neighbors or more are: 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 54 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 19, 25)>, <0, (9, 19, 21)>, <0, (16, 19, 28)>, <0, (19, 21, 9)>, <0, (19, 25, 29)>, <4, (7, 9, 24)>, <7, (0, 8, 26)>, <9, (0, 12, 21)>, <16, (0, 18, 22)>, <18, (10, 21, 21)>, <21, (2, 15, 21)>, <22, (3, 11, 20)>, <25, (8, 12, 29)>, <26, (7, 17, 29)>
