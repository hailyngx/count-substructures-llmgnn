Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 0) (10, 5) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 17) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 16) (1, 0) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 2)
(16, 1), (16, 18), (16, 19)
(3, 17), (3, 14), (3, 8)
(15, 8), (15, 12)
(5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 10)
(9, 5), (9, 17), (9, 13)
(4, 7), (4, 12)
(7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 19), (7, 2)
(2, 11), (2, 7), (2, 18), (2, 13)
(18, 16), (18, 2), (18, 6), (18, 17)
(6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 18), (6, 19)
(0, 11), (0, 14), (0, 1)
(14, 11), (14, 3), (14, 0)
(10, 5)
(8, 3), (8, 15), (8, 17)
(19, 16), (19, 7), (19, 6)
(12, 15), (12, 5), (12, 4)
(1, 16), (1, 0)
(17, 3), (17, 9), (17, 18), (17, 8)
(13, 9), (13, 2)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 35 \)

So, there are 35 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [35].
