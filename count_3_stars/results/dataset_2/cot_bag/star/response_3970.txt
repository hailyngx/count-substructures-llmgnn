Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 6), (8, 9), (8, 6), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 2), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2)}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, going through each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 1 *inom{5}{3}* = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
