Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, 7, and 3.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 42 \)

Therefore, there are 42 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 4)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (8, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 2)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (4, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 3, 6)>, <2, (6, 3, 0)>, <2, (8, 7, 0)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (4, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (6, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 0)>
