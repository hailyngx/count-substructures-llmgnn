Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 11), (2, 7, 12), (2, 12, 14), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 8, 11), (4, 8, 14), (4, 11, 2), (4, 14, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 13), (5, 9, 13), (5, 9, 7), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 0, 3), (6, 5, 8), (6, 8, 10), (6, 10, 9), (6, 13, 5), so it forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 2, 13), (7, 5, 9), (7, 9, 13), (7, 2, 4), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 11), (8, 10, 6), (8, 11, 4), (8, 6, 5), so it forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (9, 5, 7), (9, 5, 13), (9, 7, 13), (9, 7, 5), (9, 10, 8), (9, 14, 4), so it forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (10, 6, 8), (10, 8, 11), (10, 9, 14), (10, 6, 0), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (11, 4, 2), (11, 8, 4), (11, 2, 7), (11, 0, 3), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (13, 3, 6), (13, 5, 9), (13, 6, 5), (13, 7, 2), (13, 9, 7), so it forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 4, 12), (14, 9, 10), (14, 12, 2), (14, 10, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
