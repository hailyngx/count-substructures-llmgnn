Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 5) (9, 15) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 12) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 3) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 17, 18, 12, 3
- Node 1: 18, 6
- Node 2: 18, 16, 3, 15
- Node 3: 2, 7, 0
- Node 4: 8, 6
- Node 5: 8, 7, 19, 15
- Node 6: 4, 1, 13
- Node 7: 11, 12, 3, 5
- Node 8: 10, 4, 5
- Node 9: 15
- Node 10: 8, 19
- Node 11: 7, 13
- Node 12: 7, 16, 0, 19
- Node 13: 11, 6, 15
- Node 14: 16
- Node 15: 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 16: 14, 2, 18, 12
- Node 17: 0, 19
- Node 18: 2, 16, 0, 1
- Node 19: 17, 10, 12, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <0, (17, 18, 12)>
  - <0, (17, 18, 3)>
  - <0, (18, 12, 3)>
  - <0, (17, 12, 3)>

- Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <2, (18, 16, 3)>
  - <2, (18, 15, 3)>
  - <2, (16, 12, 3)>
  - <2, (15, 5, 3)>

- Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <5, (8, 7, 15)>
  - <5, (8, 19, 15)>
  - <5, (7, 19, 15)>
  - <5, (7, 15, 13)>

- Node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <7, (11, 12, 5)>
  - <7, (11, 3, 5)>
  - <7, (12, 3, 5)>
  - <7, (12, 19, 5)>

- Node 8: [3 choose 3] = 1
  - <8, (10, 4, 5)>

- Node 12: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <12, (7, 16, 0)>
  - <12, (7, 19, 5)>
  - <12, (16, 0, 19)>
  - <12, (0, 19, 5)>

- Node 15: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <15, (2, 5, 13)>
  - <15, (2, 9, 13)>
  - <15, (5, 13, 9)>
  - <15, (5, 13, 7)>

- Node 16: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <16, (14, 2, 18)>
  - <16, (14, 12, 0)>
  - <16, (2, 18, 12)>
  - <16, (18, 12, 0)>

- Node 18: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <18, (2, 16, 0)>
  - <18, (2, 3, 15)>
  - <18, (16, 12, 0)>
  - <18, (3, 15, 1)>

- Node 19: [4 choose 3] = 4
  - <19, (17, 10, 12)>
  - <19, (17, 10, 5)>
  - <19, (10, 12, 5)>
  - <19, (17, 12, 5)>

Adding up the number of unique 3-stars for each node gives us a total of 29 3-stars. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
