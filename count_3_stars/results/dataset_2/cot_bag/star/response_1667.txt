Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 27) (12, 10) (12, 11) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 26) (27, 16) (15, 20) (15, 14) (15, 24) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 28) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 18) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 21) (13, 1) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 11) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 14) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 3) (18, 9) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (29, 1) (29, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 1) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 25) (14, 19) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 4) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (0, 29) (0, 24) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 16) (28, 20) 

Response:
Given the information, we can construct the following 3-stars based on the graph:

- Node 4 forms <4, (7, 9, 16)>
- Node 7 forms <7, (4, 9, 21)>
- Node 9 forms <9, (4, 7, 22)>
- Node 16 forms <16, (4, 1, 27)>
- Node 20 forms <20, (7, 15, 27)>
- Node 14 forms <14, (5, 15, 25)>
- Node 27 forms <27, (23, 20, 26)>
- Node 21 forms <21, (7, 13, 26)>
- Node 11 forms <11, (12, 17, 19)>
- Node 1 forms <1, (13, 16, 29)>
- Node 22 forms <22, (9, 17, 19)>
- Node 3 forms <3, (8, 14, 19)>
- Node 6 forms <6, (8, 10, 16)>
- Node 10 forms <10, (6, 12, 22)>
- Node 12 forms <12, (10, 11, 17)>
- Node 15 forms <15, (5, 14, 20)>
- Node 25 forms <25, (14, 17, 26)>
- Node 19 forms <19, (3, 11, 22)>
- Node 5 forms <5, (14, 24, 15)>
- Node 8 forms <8, (3, 6, 16)>
- Node 13 forms <13, (1, 21, 1)>
- Node 0 forms <0, (24, 29, 0)>
- Node 29 forms <29, (1, 0, 29)>
- Node 17 forms <17, (11, 22, 25)>
- Node 23 forms <23, (27, 26, 23)>
- Node 28 forms <28, (20)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [25].
