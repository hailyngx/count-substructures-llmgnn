Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: $1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>
