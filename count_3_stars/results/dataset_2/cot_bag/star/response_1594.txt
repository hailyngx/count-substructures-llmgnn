Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (19, 15) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 5) (13, 14) (16, 6) (16, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors 9, 3, 7, 15.
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 8, 15, 14.
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 10, 17, 12, 5.
- Node 3 has neighbors 11, 0, 16, 12, 18.
- Node 5 has neighbors 15, 2, 18.
- Node 7 has neighbors 17, 0, 14.
- Node 9 has neighbors 6, 2, 11, 0.
- Node 10 has neighbors 17, 4, 2.
- Node 11 has neighbors 9, 3, 14, 12.
- Node 12 has neighbors 3, 2, 11.
- Node 14 has neighbors 11, 7, 1, 13.
- Node 15 has neighbors 0, 1, 19, 5.
- Node 17 has neighbors 10, 2, 7.
- Node 18 has neighbors 3, 5.
- Node 19 has neighbors 15.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 18, and 19, there are no 3-stars formed as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- For node 14, there is 1 unique 3-star: <14, (11, 7, 1)>.
- For node 2, there are 10 unique 3-stars: <2, (9, 10, 17)>, <2, (9, 12, 5)>, <2, (9, 17, 7)>, <2, (10, 17, 7)>, <2, (9, 10, 12)>, <2, (9, 17, 2)>, <2, (10, 17, 2)>, <2, (9, 2, 12)>, <2, (2, 12, 5)>, <2, (5, 18, 3)>.
- For node 9, there is 1 unique 3-star: <9, (6, 2, 11)>.
- For node 11, there is 1 unique 3-star: <11, (9, 3, 14)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
