Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 5, 3)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
