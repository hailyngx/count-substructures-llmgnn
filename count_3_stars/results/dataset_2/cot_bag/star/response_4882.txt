Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1 ---- 3 ---- 6
   | \   / | \   |
   |  \ /  |  \  |
   |   5   |   0 |
   |  / \  |  /  |
   | /   \ | /   |
   8 ---- 2 ---- 4
     \        /
       \    /
         7
```

There are 5 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

So, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
