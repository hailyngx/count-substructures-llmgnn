Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 17) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 1) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (25, 21) (6, 9) (6, 21) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 12) (10, 27) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 19) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 18) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 3) (20, 8) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 19) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 11) (5, 2) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 23) (1, 0) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (23, 10) (23, 24) (23, 16) (23, 4) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 21, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: There are 4 edges connected to node 3. So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 21: There are 5 edges connected to node 21. So, the number of 3-stars with node 21 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 12: There are 6 edges connected to node 12. So, the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 14: There are 4 edges connected to node 14. So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 38 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (2, 5, 14)>, <21, (6, 8, 17)>, <12, (0, 9, 13)>.
