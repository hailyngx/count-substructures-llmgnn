Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars present.

To calculate the total number of 3-stars, we will consider each node with three or more neighbors. For each such node:
- If the node has exactly 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
- If the node has more than 3 neighbors, we can choose 3 neighbors out of the total neighbors in \( \binom{n}{3} \) ways to form 3-stars.

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {6, 9, 12, 5, 10}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {9, 17, 7, 19, 19}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {11, 13, 19, 15, 1}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {9, 14, 2, 0}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {6, 17, 8, 4, 3}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {16, 8, 7, 18}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {11, 4, 15}. Hence, it forms only 1 3-star.
8. Node 19 has 5 neighbors: {14, 8, 3, 10, 19}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars is 59, and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (6, 9, 12)>, <3, (9, 17, 7)>, <8, (11, 13, 19)>, <12, (9, 14, 2)>, <13, (6, 17, 8)>, <15, (16, 8, 7)>, <16, (11, 4, 15)>, <19, (14, 8, 3)>, with a final count of [59].
