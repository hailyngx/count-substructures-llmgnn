Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 14) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 13) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 11) (19, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 15) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 14) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24 \)  
Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in the given graph.
