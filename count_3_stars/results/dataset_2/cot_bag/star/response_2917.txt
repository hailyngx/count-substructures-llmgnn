Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 56 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (8, 9, 0)>
- <8, (1, 3, 0)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
- <9, (8, 0, 3)>
