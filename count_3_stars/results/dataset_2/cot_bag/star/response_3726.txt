Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 3, 6)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (7, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (4, 1, 5, 0)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (7, 1, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (9, 5, 2, 8, 0)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (4, 0, 9, 5, 1)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (7, 1, 6, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
