Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 26) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 22) (12, 7) (12, 5) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (26, 20) (28, 25) (28, 13) (10, 3) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 19) (19, 22) (19, 16) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (1, 13) (29, 4) (29, 15) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 6) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 21) (24, 5) (24, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 3, 25, 8, 13, 22, 23, 0, 20, 7, 4, 18, 26, 28, 10, 15, 11, 16, 19, 27, 29, 5, 9, 2, 17, 21, and 6.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 51

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51]. 

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (25, 7, 10)>
<3, (25, 7, 4)>
<3, (25, 7, 8)>
<3, (25, 4, 8)>
<3, (25, 4, 7)>
<25, (3, 7, 8)>
<25, (3, 7, 10)>
<25, (3, 7, 4)>
<25, (3, 8, 4)>
<8, (25, 7, 13)>
…
(omitting intermediate combinations)
…
<17, (18, 15, 9)>
<17, (18, 15, 21)>
<17, (18, 9, 21)>
<21, (18, 15, 11)>
<21, (18, 15, 17)>
<21, (18, 11, 17)>
<6, (13, 2, 6)>

We have listed out the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
