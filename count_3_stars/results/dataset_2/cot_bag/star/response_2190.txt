Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 28) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 2) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 22) (0, 12) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 28) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 18) (24, 29) (17, 26) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 16) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 13) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 12) (3, 22) (3, 19) (3, 29) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 10) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 7) (28, 5) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 2) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 23) (10, 25) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 14, 15, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of 46 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (12, 14, 25)> <0, (12, 14, 29)> <0, (14, 22, 29)> <0, (14, 25, 29)> 
<1, (4, 15, 25)> <4, (1, 14, 21)> <4, (1, 14, 25)> <4, (1, 13, 19)> 
<14, (0, 15, 29)> <14, (25, 29, 0)> <19, (13, 20, 28)> <22, (3, 19, 28)>
<23, (0, 10, 25)>  <24, (11, 18, 26)> <25, (1, 8, 10)> <26, (17, 24, 29)>
<28, (5, 22, 27)> <29, (0, 26, 24)>
