Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 25) (12, 7) (12, 21) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 27) (6, 11) (6, 16) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 22) (18, 0) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 22) (3, 4) (17, 23) (17, 2) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 27) (20, 19) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 22) (8, 15) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 21) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 24) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 24) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 16) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 19) (24, 19) (24, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges in this graph. 

Based on the provided edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:   
\[ \binom{9}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{0}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{21}{3} = 504 \]

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [504].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
