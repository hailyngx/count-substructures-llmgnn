Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (26, 20) (26, 25) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 13) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 16) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 14) (14, 21) (13, 18) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 19) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 3) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 3) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 27) (5, 12) (2, 27) (24, 18) (24, 12) (19, 1) (19, 23) (25, 26) (25, 1) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 29) (3, 16) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 19) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
Let's first write down the nodes with exactly three neighbors:

- Node 3: Neighbors {10, 27, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 8, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {20, 21, 28}
- Node 7: Neighbors {17, 22, 23}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 10, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 20, 24}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 18, 26}
- Node 15: Neighbors {8, 11, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 6, 21}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 12, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {13, 24, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {6, 12, 26}
- Node 21: Neighbors {6, 16, 28}
- Node 22: Neighbors {7, 17, 29}
- Node 23: Neighbors {4, 7, 19}
- Node 24: Neighbors {18, 12, 28}
- Node 25: Neighbors {26, 1, 1}
- Node 27: Neighbors {4, 5, 3}
- Node 29: Neighbors {22, 23, 3}

Now we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 23 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 29 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars we found:
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35]. Let's list them in unique 3-star pairs:

<3, (10, 27, 29)>
<5, (0, 8, 12)>
<6, (20, 21, 28)>
<7, (17, 22, 23)>
<9, (4, 8, 12)>
<11, (0, 10, 15)>
<12, (9, 20, 24)>
<13, (10, 18, 26)>
<15, (8, 11, 17)>
<16, (3, 6, 21)>
<17, (7, 12, 15)>
<18, (13, 24, 28)>
<20, (6, 12, 26)>
<21, (6, 16, 28)>
<22, (7, 17, 29)>
<23, (4, 7, 19)>
<24, (18, 12, 28)>
<25, (26, 1, 19)>
<27, (4, 5, 3)>
<29, (22, 23, 3)>
