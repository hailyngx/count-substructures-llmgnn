Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph given the nodes and edges provided. Once we have the visual representation, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as per the method described earlier. 

The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), 
(4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2), 
(7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 8), 
(6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), 
(2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3), 
(8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 1), 
(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 6), 
(3, 6), (3, 2), 
(1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it creates.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (5, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)
 => Total 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (5, 2), (9, 2), (4, 2), (7, 2), (3, 2)
 => Total 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2)
 => Total 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (9, 6), (4, 6), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0)
 => Total 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 8)
 => Total 3-stars = 5 choose 3 = 10

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (5, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (8, 1)
 => Total 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1)
 => Total 3-stars = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (5, 9, 4)>, 
<2, (5, 9, 4)>, 
<4, (9, 7, 6)>, 
<6, (9, 4, 3)>, 
<7, (4, 2, 8)>.
