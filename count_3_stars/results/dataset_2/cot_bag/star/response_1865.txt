Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 10, 14).
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (5, 8, 11, 12, 13).
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 10, 12, 13).
Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9, 14).
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (2, 8, 10, 14, 0).
Node 10 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9).
Node 12 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 13).
Node 13 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 11, 14).
Node 14 has 5 neighbors (3, 8, 9, 13, 0).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 70 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 70.  
Therefore, the answer is [70]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 13>
<8, 1, 9>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 8, 14>
<10, 0, 9>
<12, 0, 4>
<13, 7, 14>
<14, 8, 9>
