Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (4, 3) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (19, 14) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 9) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 14, 17, 10, 12, 18, 13, and 11.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 30 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 18, 15)>
<9, (6, 18, 16)>
<9, (6, 18, 13)>
<1, (6, 11, 18)>
<14, (17, 11, 19)>
<14, (17, 11, 10)>
<17, (14, 15, 11)>
<17, (14, 15, 10)>
<17, (14, 15, 11)>
<10, (14, 17, 12)>
<18, (9, 1, 8)>
<18, (9, 1, 19)>
<18, (9, 8, 19)>
<18, (1, 8, 19)>
<13, (9, 7, 0)>
<11, (1, 14, 17)>
<11, (1, 14, 5)>
<11, (17, 14, 5)>
<11, (14, 17, 5)>
