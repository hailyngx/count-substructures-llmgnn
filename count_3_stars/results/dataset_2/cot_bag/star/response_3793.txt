Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
Applying the rules for a 3-star graph to this scenario, we can find the total number of 3-stars by examining the nodes and their neighboring nodes.

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors
  
Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\(\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 57\)

Hence, there are 57 3-stars in the given graph. 

List of unique 3-stars:
\[<5, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 5, 14)>, <12, (5, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <0, (2, 13, 14)>\]
