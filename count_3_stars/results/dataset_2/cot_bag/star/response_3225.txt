Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 17) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 28) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 26) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 24) (2, 28) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 18) (12, 24) (27, 9) (7, 15) (21, 9) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 2) (28, 29) (28, 11) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 4) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 24) (11, 28) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 29) (24, 2) (24, 12) (24, 26) (24, 15) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (19, 20) (16, 23) (16, 29) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 20) (9, 17) (9, 27) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 14) (20, 19) (20, 8) (20, 15) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
 3 -- 1   0   4
 |   |  / \  |
25  10 13  2 |
 |   | /    \|
22 -- 17   9 26
 |    |   / | 
23 -- 16 29 24
     |\ 
     28
      |
     11
```

From the given edge list, we can see that each node has the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Nodes 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 27, and 28: 4 neighbors
- Nodes 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, we have \(C(4, 3)=4\) 3-stars for each node, so 4 * 7 = 28 in total.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, we have \(C(3, 3)=1\) 3-star for each node, so 1 * 17 = 17 in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 28 + 17 = 45. 

So, the final answer is [45] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<22, (23, 16, 29)>
<17, (25, 10, 2)>
<29, (21, 16, 28)>
<26, (17, 24, 13)>
<9, (17, 14, 21)>
<8, (6, 14, 20)>
<15, (7, 24, 20)>
<24, (12, 26, 15)>
