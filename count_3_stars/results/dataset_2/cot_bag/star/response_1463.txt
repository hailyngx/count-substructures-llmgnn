Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 16) (12, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 13) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 0, 14, 5, 19, 10, 15, 8, 9, 7, 12, 1, 3, 2, 4, 18, 6, 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

For node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [44] \).

The unique 3-stars are: <11, (16, 1, 9)>, <16, (11, 7, 12)>, <0, (14, 10, 6)>, <14, (0, 10, 5)>, <5, (19, 8, 1)>, <19, (0, 5, 18)>, <10, (0, 14, 15)>, <15, (10, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 10, 6)>, <9, (11, 15, 7)>, <7, (16, 15, 9)>.
