Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and we can represent the given graph as follows:
```
0 --- 1 --- 7 --- 4 
|     |     |     |
3 --- 2 --- 8 --- 5
|     |     |
6 --- 9 ---|
```

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Adding these up:
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 26

So, there are 26 3-stars in this graph. Represented in the format as described above, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 5)>, <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 2)>, <9, (6, 0, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26].
