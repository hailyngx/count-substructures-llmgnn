Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 17) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 1, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [63] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (6, 10, 16)>, <1, (6, 10, 14)>, <1, (6, 10, 19)>, <1, (6, 13, 19)>, <1, (10, 14, 19)>, <1, (1, 6, 10)>, <6, (1, 9, 17)>, <6, (1, 10, 19)>, <6, (1, 10, 16)>, <6, (1, 10, 14)>, <6, (10, 16, 19)>, <9, (5, 6, 17)>, <9, (5, 6, 13)>, <9, (6, 17, 19)>, <9, (6, 17, 15)>, <9, (13, 11, 19)>, <9, (13, 6, 19)>, <12, (2, 15, 17)>, <13, (6, 11, 19)>, <15, (3, 17, 19)>, <17, (7, 9, 17)>, <17, (7, 12, 17)>
