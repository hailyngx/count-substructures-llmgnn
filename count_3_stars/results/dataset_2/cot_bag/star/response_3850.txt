Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 22) (18, 26) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 0) (23, 7) (23, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) (26, 18) (26, 13) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 2) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 29) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 2) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 24) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 28) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 3) (6, 14) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 3) (24, 25) (12, 18) (13, 26) (13, 0) (13, 29) (29, 21) (29, 13) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's analyze each of them to find the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 2: It has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 10, 16, 27).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 10)>, <2, (1, 5, 16)>, <2, (1, 5, 27)>, <2, (1, 10, 16)>, <2, (1, 10, 27)>, <2, (1, 16, 27)>, <2, (5, 10, 16)>, <2, (5, 10, 27)>, <2, (5, 16, 27)>, <2, (10, 16, 27)>

2. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 14, 24).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 6, 14)>, <3, (2, 6, 24)>, <3, (2, 14, 24)>, <3, (6, 14, 24)>

3. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (7, 25, 28, 5).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 25, 28)>, <4, (7, 25, 5)>, <4, (7, 28, 5)>, <4, (25, 28, 5)>

4. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 14, 19).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 7, 14)>, <6, (3, 7, 19)>, <6, (3, 14, 19)>, <6, (7, 14, 19)>

5. Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (0, 9, 21, 23).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 9, 21)>, <8, (0, 9, 23)>, <8, (0, 21, 23)>, <8, (9, 21, 23)>

6. Node 13: It has 3 neighbors (0, 26, 29).
   Number of 3-stars: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with this node.
   Unique 3-stars: <13, (0, 26, 29)>

7. Node 15: It has 3 neighbors (16, 27, 14).
   Number of 3-stars: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with this node.
   Unique 3-stars: <15, (16, 27, 14)>

8. Node 16: It has 4 neighbors (11, 15, 19, 2).
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <16, (11, 15, 19)>, <16, (11, 15, 2)>, <16, (11, 19, 2)>, <16, (15, 19, 2)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
