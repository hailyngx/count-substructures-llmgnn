Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 16) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 18) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 18) (16, 9) (16, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up gives us a total of 42 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42]. 

And the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 10)>, <1, (0, 4, 14)>, <3, (9, 13, 17)>, <4, (1, 6, 13)>, <12, (0, 1, 5)>, <18, (0, 7, 10)>
