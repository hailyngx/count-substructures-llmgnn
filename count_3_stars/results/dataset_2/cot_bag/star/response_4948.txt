Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
Each node has the following neighbors:

- Node 0: {6, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {8, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 6, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 1, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 7: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 9: [5 choose 3] = 10

Summing these up: 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 53

So, there are a total of 53 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <2, (8, 9, 3)>, <2, (8, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 2)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (8, 6, 0)>, <3, (8, 6, 2)>, <3, (8, 2, 0)>, <3, (6, 0, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 1)>, <6, (5, 8, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (8, 3, 0)>, <6, (8, 3, 2)>, <6, (8, 0, 2)>, <6, (3, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 6)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 0)>
