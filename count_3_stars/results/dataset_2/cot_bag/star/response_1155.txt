Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 8) (1, 15) (1, 29) (21, 3) (21, 5) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 16) (20, 9) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 2) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 5) (3, 21) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 18) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 19) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 28) (10, 5) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 10) (5, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 3) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 2) (4, 22) (4, 25) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 6) (17, 15) (17, 16) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 16) (28, 25) (28, 9) (28, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 3-stars
- Node 13: 3 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 3-stars
- Node 22: 3 3-stars
- Node 23: 2 3-stars
- Node 24: 3 3-stars
- Node 25: 3 3-stars
- Node 26: 3 3-stars
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 12, 18)>
<5, (3, 14, 17)>
<9, (8, 12, 29)>
<12, (7, 18, 29)>
<13, (11, 19, 26)>
<14, (6, 22, 5)>
<16, (2, 17, 24)>
<22, (8, 19, 26)>
<23, (0, 3, 26)>
<24, (5, 16, 17)>
<25, (4, 16, 28)>
<26, (2, 13, 23)>
<28, (9, 18, 25)>
<29, (1, 9, 12)>
