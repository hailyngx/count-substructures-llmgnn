Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 20) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 20) (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 15) (5, 4) (9, 0) (9, 24) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 29) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (29, 17) (29, 14) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 11) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (26, 13) (26, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 7) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 10) (19, 27) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 6) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 24) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 8) (4, 22) (4, 5) (28, 18) (28, 24) (28, 23) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 23) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (27, 8) (27, 3) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 27) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have exactly three neighbors, which are nodes 13, 22, and 24. These nodes will each form 1 3-star. 

So, the total number of 3-stars formed is $[1 + 1 + 1] = [3]$.

List of unique 3-stars found: 
<13, (22, 4, 15)>
<22, (13, 4, 15)>
<24, (9, 2, 8)>
