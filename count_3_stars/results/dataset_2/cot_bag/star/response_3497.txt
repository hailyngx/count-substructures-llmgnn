Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 2) (4, 18) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 17) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (1, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
This graph has the following 3-stars:

- [<5, (11, 6, 14)>, <6, (16, 7, 18)>, <14, (8, 5, 15)>]
- [<11, (16, 7, 19)>]
- [<15, (5, 7, 0)>, <16, (11, 6, 13)>]
- [<0, (11, 15, 2)>]
- [<2, (8, 13, 0)>, <3, (12, 19, 17)>]
- [<8, (14, 10, 2)>, <12, (13, 3, 17)>]
- [<13, (16, 12, 2)>, <17, (9, 18, 12)>] 

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph.
