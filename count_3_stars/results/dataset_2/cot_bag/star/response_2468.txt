Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 12) (26, 27) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 19) (0, 2) (0, 24) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 25) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (21, 3) (3, 21) (3, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 3) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 27) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 18) (19, 20) (19, 17) (14, 25) (29, 1) (29, 5) (29, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 16) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 10) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 27) (12, 9) (12, 29) (12, 10) (10, 25) (10, 4) (10, 12) (5, 18) (5, 29) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors are 13, 22, 18, 15, 20, 0, 2, 6, 11, 1, 17, 7, 25, 4, 24, 29, 16, 23, 9, 12, and 27.

Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 93 \)

So, there are 93 total 3-stars in the graph. 
Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final answer: \[93\].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<13, (1, 15, 17)>, <13, (15, 17, 18)>, <13, (15, 18, 1)>, <13, (15, 18, 22)>, <13, (15, 18, 12)>, <13, (15, 18, 23)>, <13, (15, 18, 27)>, <13, (17, 18, 12)>, <13, (17, 18, 23)>, <13, (17, 18, 27)>, <13, (18, 1, 27)>, <13, (18, 12, 23)>, <13, (18, 12, 27)>, <13, (18, 23, 27)>
