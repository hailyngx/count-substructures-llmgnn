- Node 2: 3   
- Node 3: 2   
- Node 4: 3   
- Node 5: 3   
- Node 6: 1   
- Node 7: 4   
- Node 8: 6   
- Node 9: 2   
- Node 10: 4   
- Node 11: 3   
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 5
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 3
- Node 21: 2
- Node 22: 4
- Node 23: 3
- Node 24: 3
- Node 25: 1
- Node 26: 4
- Node 27: 2
- Node 28: 4
- Node 29: 4
- Node 0: 4  

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum_{\text{node has 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{(\text{degree of the node})}{3} \]

For the given graph: 
- Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 0  
- Calculating the 3-stars:  
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (Only one 3-star)  
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (Only one 3-star)  
  - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (Only one 3-star)  
  - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)   (Twenty 3-stars)  
  - Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   (Ten 3-stars)  
  - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (Only one 3-star)  
  - Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   (Four 3-stars)  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars are:  
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [68] \]

And the unique 3-stars are:  
\[ <2, (1, 5, 14)>, <4, (23, 5, 29)>, <5, (4, 29, 26)>, <7, (27, 1, 10)>, <8, (15, 13, 18)>, <10, (15, 27, 26)>, <13, (2, 28, 12)>, <14, (9, 16, 12)>, <15, (27, 20, 21)>, <16, (21, 0, 14)>, <17, (22, 6, 24)>, <18, (8, 5, 25)>, <22, (8, 20, 11)>, <24, (16, 28, 17)>, <26, (29, 0, 2)>, <28, (11, 24, 17)>, <29, (4, 9, 0)> \]
