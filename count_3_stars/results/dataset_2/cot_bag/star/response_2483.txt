Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 9) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 1, 13, 10, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 7, 10, 0, 12
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 12, 5
- Node 3 has neighbors: 11, 10, 12
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 0, 6, 2
- Node 5 has neighbors: 8, 2
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 13, 1
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 5, 14, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 13, 12, 0, 14
- Node 10 has neighbors: 7, 1, 3, 11, 0
- Node 11 has neighbors: 3, 10, 14, 12
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 3, 13, 11, 2, 9
- Node 13 has neighbors: 7, 12, 9, 0
- Node 14 has neighbors: 8, 11, 9

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 13: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)

Summing up the 3-stars for each node: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61]. Some unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<12, (1, 3, 11)>
