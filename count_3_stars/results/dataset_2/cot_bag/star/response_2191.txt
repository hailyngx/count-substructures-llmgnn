Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 5, 14)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 14)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 11)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 11)>
- <9, (6, 10, 13)>
- <9, (9, 10, 13)>
- <9, (9, 11, 13)>
- <9, (9, 13, 14)>
- <10, (6, 9, 12)>
- <10, (9, 12, 13)>
- <10, (12, 14, 13)>
- <11, (5, 9, 13)>
- <11, (4, 7, 11)>
- <11, (9, 13, 14)>
- <12, (5, 10, 14)>
- <12, (10, 13, 14)>
- <13, (9, 11, 14)>
- <14, (0, 10, 12)>
