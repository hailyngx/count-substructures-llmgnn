Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 5

For 3-stars:
Node 0 - 1 3-star
Node 1 - 1 3-star
Node 2 - 1 3-star
Node 3 - 1 3-star
Node 5 - 1 3-star
Node 6 - 1 3-star
Node 7 - 1 3-star
Node 9 - 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
