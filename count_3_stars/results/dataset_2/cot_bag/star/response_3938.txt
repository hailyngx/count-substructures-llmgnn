Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 1) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) (9, 13) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 12) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 36 3-stars in this graph, represented as:

[36]

And the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (19, 10, 12)>
<2, (17, 19, 12)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, 15, 12)>
<7, (11, 5, 15)>
<8, (3, 10, 6)>
<10, (14, 8, 1)>
<11, (7, 19, 15)>
<12, (15, 1, 6)>
<13, (14, 18, 6)>
<14, (10, 13, 18)>
<15, (16, 6, 7)>
<16, (18, 4, 15)>
<17, (2, 19, 18)>
<19, (11, 10, 17)>
