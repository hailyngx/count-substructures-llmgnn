Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 8, 7, 12, 6, 0, 13, 3, 11, 1, 14, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 59

Therefore, there are [59] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (13, 7, 12)>
<9, (8, 4, 10)>
<4, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (12, 0, 10)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<13, (5, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 11)>
<11, (12, 0, 2)>
<1, (8, 13, 14)>
<14, (9, 12, 1)>
<10, (4, 7, 2)>
