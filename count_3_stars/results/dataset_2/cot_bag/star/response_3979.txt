The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [0, 7, 9], <0, 7, 9>
- Node 6: [6, 13, 15], <6, 13, 15>, [6, 17, 15], <6, 17, 15>, [6, 7, 26], <6, 7, 26>, [6, 15, 17], <6, 15, 17>
- Node 7: [7, 6, 13], <7, 6, 13>, [7, 26, 0], <7, 26, 0>, [7, 3, 0], <7, 3, 0>, [7, 26, 1], <7, 26, 1>
- Node 9: [9, 0, 7], <9, 0, 7>, [9, 25, 19], <9, 25, 19>, [9, 28, 16], <9, 28, 16>, [9, 27, 17], <9, 27, 17>

- Node 15: [15, 6, 13], <15, 6, 13>, [15, 17, 6], <15, 17, 6>, [15, 24, 1], <15, 24, 1>, [15, 28, 20], <15, 28, 20>
- Node 16: [16, 5, 26], <16, 5, 26>, [16, 27, 9], <16, 27, 9>, [16, 26, 7], <16, 26, 7>
- Node 17: [17, 6, 15], <17, 6, 15>, [17, 27, 20], <17, 27, 20>, [17, 20, 29], <17, 20, 29>, [17, 15, 6], <17, 15, 6>
- Node 18: [18, 5, 29], <18, 5, 29>, [18, 2, 3], <18, 2, 3>, [18, 20, 29], <18, 20, 29>, [18, 29, 20], <18, 29, 20>

- Node 20: [20, 28, 15], <20, 28, 15>, [20, 17, 27], <20, 17, 27>, [20, 29, 18], <20, 29, 18>, [20, 25, 9], <20, 25, 9>
- Node 23: [23, 12, 2], <23, 12, 2>, [23, 19, 25], <23, 19, 25>, [23, 11, 25], <23, 11, 25>
- Node 25: [25, 9, 19], <25, 9, 19>, [25, 11, 23], <25, 11, 23>, [25, 20, 29], <25, 20, 29>, [25, 19, 14], <25, 19, 14>
- Node 26: [26, 7, 6], <26, 7, 6>, [26, 16, 5], <26, 16, 5>, [26, 1, 24], <26, 1, 24>, [26, 7, 0], <26, 7, 0>
- Node 28: [28, 20, 15], <28, 20, 15>, [28, 15, 17], <28, 15, 17>, [28, 9, 27], <28, 9, 27>, [28, 20, 9], <28, 20, 9>
- Node 29: [29, 18, 20], <29, 18, 20>, [29, 5, 18], <29, 5, 18>, [29, 20, 17], <29, 20, 17>, [29, 5, 16], <29, 5, 16>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].
