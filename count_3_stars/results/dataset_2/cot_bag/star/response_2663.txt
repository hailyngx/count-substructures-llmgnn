Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
Node 1: {0, 4}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 4}
Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {5, 6, 8}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 does not form any 3-stars. (0)

Node 3 forms 1 3-star. (1)

Node 4 forms 1 3-star. (1)

Node 6 forms 2 3-stars. (2)

Node 8 forms 1 3-star. (1)

Node 9 forms 1 3-star. (1)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>
