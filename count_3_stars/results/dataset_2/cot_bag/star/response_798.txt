Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 1) (22, 16) (22, 0) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (7, 6) (7, 23) (21, 5) (21, 17) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 25) (14, 0) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (17, 21) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 1) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 2) (28, 20) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 6) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 18) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 29) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 19) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 28) (9, 14) (9, 2) (6, 27) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 29) (2, 28) (2, 9) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 24) 

Response:
There are some nodes that have at least three neighbors, which can form 3-stars. Let's identify those nodes and count the number of 3-stars they form.

Nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45 \]

Therefore, there are 45 3-stars in the given graph. Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [45].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (22, 27, 12)>
- <0, (22, 27, 14)>
- <0, (22, 27, 25)>
- <0, (27, 29, 6)>
- <0, (27, 29, 11)>
- <3, (13, 15, 10)>
- <6, (27, 7, 4)>
- <9, (14, 2, 9)>
- <19, (17, 8, 10)>
- <20, (3, 26, 28)>
