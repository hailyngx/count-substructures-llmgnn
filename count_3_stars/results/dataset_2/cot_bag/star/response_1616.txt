Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 14, 17, 13, 2, 8, 21, 12, 24, 22, 26, 5, 28, 3, 11, 4, 27, 10, 29, 16, 19, 15

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
12: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
24: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
28: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
11: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
10: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
29: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].
