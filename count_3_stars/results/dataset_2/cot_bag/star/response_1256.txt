Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 15) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 9) (26, 12) (26, 8) (6, 15) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 11) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 0) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 12) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 19) (19, 29) (19, 1) (22, 29) (22, 24) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 5) (10, 14) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 20) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 9) (9, 28) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 25) (14, 10) (20, 1) (20, 11) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 12, 23, 19
- Node 2 has neighbors: 12, 18, 17, 21
- Node 3 has neighbors: 12, 21, 16, 0
- Node 5 has neighbors: 18, 10, 11
- Node 7 has neighbors: 11, 23, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 7, 27, 15, 26
- Node 9 has neighbors: 28, 13, 16, 25
- Node 10 has neighbors: 27, 0, 24, 5, 14
- Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 21, 5, 20
- Node 13 has neighbors: 27, 18, 17, 9
- Node 15 has neighbors: 8, 6, 17
- Node 16 has neighbors: 24, 3, 9, 25
- Node 17 has neighbors: 2, 13, 0, 15
- Node 18 has neighbors: 2, 5, 13
- Node 21 has neighbors: 2, 3, 11
- Node 23 has neighbors: 7, 1
- Node 24 has neighbors: 16, 22, 10
- Node 25 has neighbors: 28, 16, 9
- Node 26 has neighbors: 12, 8
- Node 27 has neighbors: 7, 10, 13
- Node 28 has neighbors: 29, 25, 9
- Node 29 has neighbors: 28, 19, 22

Based on the above, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].  
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (12, 18, 17)>  
<3, (12, 21, 16)>  
<5, (18, 10, 11)>  
<7, (11, 23, 8)>
