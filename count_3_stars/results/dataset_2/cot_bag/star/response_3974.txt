Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (21, 16) (21, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 15) (27, 20) (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 26) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 4) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 22) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 22) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 29) (4, 26) (4, 14) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 20) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 23) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 25) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 14) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (24, 12) (24, 9) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 24) (9, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (25, 18) (25, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 23) 

Response:
Applying the method described earlier, we'll first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors.
Based on the provided list of edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 0 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (15, 18, 6)>
- Node 3: 0 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (12, 20, 29)> 
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (2, 28, 3)>
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (14, 23, 0)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (12, 17, 24)>
- Node 10: 1 3-star <10, (13, 19, 23)>
- Node 12: 1 3-star <12, (5, 17, 24)>
- Node 14: 1 3-star <14, (3, 7, 15)>
- Node 15: 1 3-star <15, (2, 14, 27)>
- Node 16: 1 3-star <16, (11, 17, 21)>
- Node 18: 1 3-star <18, (2, 25, 28)>
- Node 20: 1 3-star <20, (5, 19, 27)>
- Node 22: 1 3-star <22, (6, 26, 29)>
- Node 23: 1 3-star <23, (7, 19, 10)>
- Node 24: 1 3-star <24, (9, 12, 3)>
- Node 26: 1 3-star <26, (1, 22, 4)>
- Node 28: 1 3-star <28, (6, 18, 22)>
- Node 29: 1 3-star <29, (5, 22, 25)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [19].
