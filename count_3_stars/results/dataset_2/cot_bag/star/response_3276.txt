Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (8, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {8, 10, 17, 3}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {17, 11, 19, 10}
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {4, 14, 1, 10}
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {4, 14, 11, 17}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {0, 11, 15, 4}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {7, 2, 18, 15}
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {7, 2, 0, 1}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {17, 18, 15, 16}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {18, 13, 3}
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {5, 1, 12, 19}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {14, 6, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the final result is [38].
