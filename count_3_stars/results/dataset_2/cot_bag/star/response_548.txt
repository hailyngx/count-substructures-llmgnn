Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors will form one 3-star each. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Degree 5 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 1: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 2: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 3: Degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 5, 6) - This node has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.

5. Node 4: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 5: Degree 5 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

7. Node 6: Degree 5 (neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8) - This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

8. Node 7: Degree 4 (neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

9. Node 8: Degree 4 (neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9) - This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

10. Node 9: Degree 3 (neighbors: 0, 2, 8) - This node has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
