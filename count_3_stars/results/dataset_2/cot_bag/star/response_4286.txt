Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graphs in this network are as follows:

\[
[16]
\]

\[
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 10)>, <4, (1, 8, 11)>, <6, (3, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <9, (1, 8, 13)>, <10, (3, 7, 8)>, <11, (4, 6, 12)>, <12, (8, 11, 14)>, <13, (6, 9, 14)>, <14, (0, 12, 13)>
