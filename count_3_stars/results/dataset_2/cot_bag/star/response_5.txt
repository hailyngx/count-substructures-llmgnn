Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph structures in this given graph, we need to consider each node. We will identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them.

From the given list of edges, we can determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (4, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0), (9, 0)
- Node 1: (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (9, 1)
- Node 2: (4, 2), (5, 2), (9, 2), (0, 2)
- Node 3: (7, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3)
- Node 4: (7, 4), (2, 4), (9, 4), (8, 4), (0, 4)
- Node 5: (1, 5), (8, 5), (6, 5), (2, 5)
- Node 6: (1, 6), (3, 6), (5, 6), (0, 6)
- Node 7: (4, 7), (1, 7), (8, 7), (3, 7)
- Node 8: (4, 8), (7, 8), (3, 8), (5, 8)
- Node 9: (4, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (0, 9)

Based on this information, we can see that nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-star structures. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>
    
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 8, 3)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>, <7, (3, 8, 4)>, <7, (3, 1, 8)>
  
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
  
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 0, 4)>, <9, (2, 0, 4)>

There are a total of 16 3-star structures in this graph, so the final answer is [16].
