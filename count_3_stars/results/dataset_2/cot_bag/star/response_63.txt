Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 0)>
- <4, (5, 7, 2)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
