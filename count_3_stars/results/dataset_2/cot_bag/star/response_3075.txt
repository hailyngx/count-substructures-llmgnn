Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 56 = 104

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [104].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
