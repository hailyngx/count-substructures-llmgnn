Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (15, 9) (15, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {14, 7, 18, 12, 16}. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars involving node 4.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {9, 8, 12}. So, there is 1 3-star involving node 5.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 15, 17, 6}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars involving node 9.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {17, 10, 19, 13}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars involving node 11.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {17, 3, 4, 2, 19}. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars involving node 14.
Node 17 has 6 neighbors: {9, 14, 19, 8, 11, 1}. So, there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars involving node 17.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {17, 11, 1, 2}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars involving node 19.

Total number of 3-stars: $10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 53$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (8, 5, 12)>
<9, (17, 9, 15)>
<11, (17, 11, 19)>
<19, (17, 19, 1)>
<4, (7, 4, 12)>
<4, (12, 4, 16)>
<4, (18, 4, 0)>
<14, (17, 14, 3)>
<14, (2, 14, 19)>
<14, (4, 14, 2)>
<17, (19, 17, 11)>
<17, (8, 17, 3)>
<17, (14, 17, 19)>
<17, (14, 17, 9)>
<17, (11, 17, 1)>
