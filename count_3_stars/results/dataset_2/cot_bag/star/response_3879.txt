Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 23) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 0) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 25) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 14) (12, 9) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 21) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 2) (28, 21) (28, 2) (13, 11) (13, 26) (13, 3) (24, 29) (24, 26) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 20) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 29) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 3) (5, 16) (23, 14) (23, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 20) (25, 8) (25, 29) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 1) (20, 22) (20, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 59 \)

So, there are a total of 59 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting it inside brackets []:
\[ [59] \]

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:
\[ <0, (23, 27, 29)>, <4, (8, 9, 19)>, <6, (17, 27, 29)>, <8, (10, 11, 19)>, <11, (10, 13, 22)>, <14, (12, 16, 23)>, <19, (1, 22, 26)>, <21, (2, 26, 28)>, <26, (13, 21, 24)>, <27, (0, 6, 18)>, <29, (0, 25, 24)> \]
