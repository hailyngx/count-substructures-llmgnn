Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 5, 0, and 2.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up, we get: 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 56.

So, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (9, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 4)>
<9, (6, 5, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (4, 2, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 0)>
<3, (6, 4, 2)>
<8, (6, 5, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<0, (7, 1, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
