Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 27) (17, 26) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 15) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 9) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (15, 21) (15, 12) (15, 20) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 13) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 25) (3, 21) (3, 26) (9, 23) (9, 12) (22, 10) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 16) (29, 24) (19, 11) (19, 0) (6, 14) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 22) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 28) (24, 5) (24, 29) (24, 13) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbours: 21, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 21:
\[ {3 \choose 2} = 3 \]
So, there are 3 unique 3-stars with node 21 as the center:
<21, (7, 3, 20)>, <21, (7, 5, 15)>, <21, (7, 20, 15)>

For node 12:
\[ {3 \choose 2} = 3 \]
So, there are 3 unique 3-stars with node 12 as the center:
<12, (7, 15, 20)>, <12, (7, 20, 15)>, <12, (15, 20, 9)>

For node 13:
\( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
There is 1 unique 3-star with node 13 as the center:
<13, (11, 1, 24)>

In total, there are 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [7].
