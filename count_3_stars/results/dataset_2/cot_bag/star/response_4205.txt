Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 9, 7, 4

Node 1: 7, 8

Node 2: 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4

Node 3: 6, 8, 2

Node 4: 5, 6, 0, 2

Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 4

Node 6: 3, 2, 4

Node 7: 9, 0, 2, 1, 8

Node 8: 5, 9, 7, 3, 1

Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 7, 0

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 2, 4)>

For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 7, 2)>, <9, (5, 0, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 2)>, <9, (8, 0, 2)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>

For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (6, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 4)>, <2, (5, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 4)>, <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (7, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 4, 9)>, <2, (7, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (7, 4, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>, <2, (7, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 3, 8)>, <2, (7, 4, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from all the nodes: 
4 + 10 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
