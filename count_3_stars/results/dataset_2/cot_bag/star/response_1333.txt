Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 20) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 21) (27, 26) (27, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 14) (26, 27) (26, 1) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 20) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 3) (13, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (20, 28) (20, 3) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 15) (10, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (25, 28) (25, 17) (8, 11) (8, 27) (8, 28) (19, 4) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 10) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 
Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
For each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for all these nodes: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 1 = 83 \)
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [83].
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (7, 22, 10)>
- <4, (7, 10, 19)>
- <5, (9, 22, 13)>
- <6, (16, 12, 17)>
- <9, (18, 4, 24)>
- <10, (4, 15, 22)>
- <12, (16, 1, 14)>
- <15, (19, 11, 10)>
- <16, (20, 7, 16)>
- <17, (6, 29, 25)>
- <18, (2, 28, 17)>
- <19, (6, 29, 15)>
- <20, (3, 20, 28)>
- <22, (3, 22, 5)>
- <28, (8, 25, 17)>
