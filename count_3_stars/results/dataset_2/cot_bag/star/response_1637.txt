Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 0)>
- <4, (9, 1, 6)>
- <6, (9, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
