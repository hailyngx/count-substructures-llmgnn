Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 -- 8 -- 2 -- 5 -- 1
   |    |    |    |
   7 -- 4 -- 6    9
        |    |    |
        3    1    0
```

For this graph, we can see that the following nodes have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - So, there is 1 3-star starting from node 0.

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 1.

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 2.

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 4.

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 5.

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 6.

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - So, there are 10 3-stars starting from node 7.

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 8.

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - So, there are 4 3-stars starting from node 9.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 35

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (7, 4, 8)>
- <1, (7, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
