Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 12, 0, 2, 14, and 10.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 58 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 10, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 12, 10)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<12, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 14, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>
<10, (5, 4, 6)>
