Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3

We will focus on nodes with degrees equal to or greater than 3 to determine the number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- For Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars.

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 6, 13)>
<3, (0, 13, 17)>
<3, (0, 13, 19)>
<3, (6, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 8, 18)>
<3, (8, 10, 7)>
<3, (8, 10, 15)>
<3, (8, 15, 16)>
<3, (8, 15, 10)>
<3, (9, 15, 10)>
<3, (9, 15, 16)>
<3, (10, 8, 6)>
<3, (10, 8, 15)>
<3, (10, 15, 16)>
<3, (13, 0, 6)>
<3, (13, 0, 18)>
<3, (13, 3, 17)>
<3, (13, 6, 0)>
<3, (15, 9, 19)>
<3, (17, 13, 3)>
<3, (18, 0, 6)>
