Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 18) (6, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (5, 9, 15)>, <1, (5, 10, 15)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <1, (9, 10, 15)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (7, 13, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<5, (6, 13, 1)>, <5, (6, 18, 1)>, <5, (6, 18, 13)>, <5, (13, 18, 1)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<6, (5, 18, 13)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<7, (11, 15, 19)>, <7, (11, 12, 19)>, <7, (11, 12, 15)>, <7, (11, 14, 19)>, <7, (11, 14, 15)>, 
<7, (12, 14, 19)>, <7, (12, 14, 13)>, <7, (12, 13, 19)>, <7, (13, 14, 19)>, <7, (13, 14, 15)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<9, (0, 15, 1)>, <9, (0, 16, 1)>, <9, (0, 16, 15)>, <9, (15, 16, 1)>

Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<11, (3, 7, 12)>

Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<12, (4, 11, 19)>, <12, (4, 13, 19)>, <12, (4, 13, 16)>, <12, (16, 17, 4)>

Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<13, (4, 17, 14)>, <13, (4, 5, 17)>,<13, (4, 5, 14)>, <13, (17, 5, 14)>, <13, (17, 6, 14)>,
<13, (5, 6, 14)>, <13, (5, 6, 1)>, <13, (5, 1, 4)>,<13, (6, 1, 4)>,<13, (6, 18, 17)>

Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<15, (1, 9, 7)>,<15, (1, 10, 7)>,<15, (1, 10, 9)>,<15, (9, 10, 7)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
<16, (0, 12, 17)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<18, (2, 9, 6)>,<18, (2, 9, 1)>,<18, (2, 1, 10)>,<18, (9, 1, 10)>

Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<19, (3, 8, 7)>,<19, (3, 11, 7)>,<19, (3, 8, 11)>,<19, (8, 11, 7)>,<19, (8, 12, 11)>,
<19, (12, 11, 7)>,<19, (12, 16, 7)>,<19, (12, 16, 17)>,<19, (16, 17, 7)>,<19, (16, 13, 17)>

Summing up all the 3-stars gives a total of [54].
