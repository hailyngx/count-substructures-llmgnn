There are 3-stars formed at nodes: 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17, 21, 25, 27.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- For nodes with 3 neighbors:  8 * 1 = 8
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 1 * (inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} ) = 1 * (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10) = 1 * 58 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8 + 58] = 66.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (11, 25, 26)>
<7, (1, 13, 21)>
<9, (16, 18, 29)>
<12, (10, 15, 17)>
<16, (9, 18, 27)>
<17, (12, 13, 20)>
<21, (5, 7, 8)>
<25, (4, 8, 27)>
<27, (11, 16, 23)>
