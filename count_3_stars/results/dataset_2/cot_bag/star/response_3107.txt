Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so we have 4 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so we have 4 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so we have 10 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so we have 4 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so we have 10 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, so we have 10 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so we have 4 3-stars with node 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46 \]

So, there are a total of 46 3-stars in the graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 1, 4>
<6, 5, 7>
<7, 2, 6>
<9, 6, 7>
<3, 1, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 2, 7>
<7, 3, 9>
<5, 4, 2>
<8, 0, 1>
<6, 2, 7>
<9, 0, 6>
<3, 7, 9> 

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets: [46]
