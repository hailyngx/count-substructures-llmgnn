Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 19) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 27) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 20) (4, 8) (4, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 6) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 10) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 24) (17, 28) (17, 9) (17, 15) (9, 17) (9, 29) (9, 23) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 15) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (16, 12) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 17) (15, 22) (15, 10) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 3) (11, 19) (11, 3) (6, 19) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 25) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 25) (14, 6) (14, 5) (23, 18) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 29) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 14) (20, 27) (20, 3) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 22, 24)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 24, 29)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 11, 20)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 14, 29)>
5. Node 6: <6, (14, 24, 25)>
6. Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 13)>
7. Node 9: <9, (17, 23, 29)>
8. Node 10: <10, (7, 15, 26)>
9. Node 12: <12, (2, 16, 27)>
10. Node 15: <15, (10, 17, 22)>
11. Node 16: <16, (12, 20, 27)>
12. Node 19: <19, (11, 21, 26)>
13. Node 20: <20, (3, 16, 27)>
14. Node 22: <22, (10, 15, 28)>
15. Node 23: <23, (9, 28, 29)>
16. Node 24: <24, (1, 6, 29)>
17. Node 26: <26, (10, 19, 27)>
18. Node 27: <27, (12, 16, 20)>
19. Node 28: <28, (1, 22, 23)>
20. Node 29: <29, (5, 23, 24)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [20] \]
