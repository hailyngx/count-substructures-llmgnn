Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 7
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 6
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with degree >= 3:

- Node 1 has degree 7, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node with degree >= 3:

\( 35 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 117 \)

Therefore, there are 117 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets []: [117]

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:

<1, (0, 7, 14)>
<3, (8, 6, 13)>
<4, (2, 12, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
