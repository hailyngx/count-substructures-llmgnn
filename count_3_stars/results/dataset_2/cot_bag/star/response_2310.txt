Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 19) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 11) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 4) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (7, 9) 

Response:
The node degrees are:  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 3  
Node 10: degree 4  
Node 11: degree 5  
Node 12: degree 3  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 5  
Node 15: degree 2  
Node 16: degree 3  
Node 17: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 3  
Node 19: degree 3  

Based on the degrees, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:  
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Summing these results, we have a total of 41 3-stars.  
Therefore, \([41]\)  

Unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (1, 17, 15)>  
<1, (0, 17, 14)>  
<2, (18, 14, 4)>  
<4, (14, 19, 2)>  
<5, (16, 9, 13)>  
<9, (19, 5, 7)>  
<10, (3, 12, 0)>  
<11, (16, 14, 6)>  
<13, (17, 5, 18)>  
<14, (11, 4, 2)>  
<18, (11, 2, 13)>  
<19, (17, 9, 4)>
