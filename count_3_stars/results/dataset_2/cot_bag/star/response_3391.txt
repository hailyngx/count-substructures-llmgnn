Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the given graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The edges in the given graph are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 11, 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 0, 11
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 10, 3, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 10
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 0, 14, 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 14
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 4, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 2, 11, 0, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 7
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 2, 3
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 1
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 2
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 8, 1, 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 2

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
