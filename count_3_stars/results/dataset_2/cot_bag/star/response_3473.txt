Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 12) (15, 11) (27, 22) (27, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 17) (22, 27) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 1) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 28) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 24) (0, 23) (0, 16) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 26) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 17) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (9, 25) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 6) (24, 14) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 12) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 26) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (17, 11) (17, 28) (17, 7) (25, 22) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 4) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 4) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 4) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 25) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 21) (4, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors [23, 16]
- Node 1: Neighbors [18, 12, 4]
- Node 2: Neighbors [18, 20, 14, 21]
- Node 3: Neighbors [8, 26]
- Node 4: Neighbors [25, 20, 21, 1]
- Node 5: Neighbors [22, 6, 19, 28]
- Node 6: Neighbors [18, 5, 24]
- Node 7: Neighbors [19, 13, 17]
- Node 8: Neighbors [22, 3]
- Node 9: Neighbors [25]
- Node 11: Neighbors [15, 21, 17]
- Node 12: Neighbors [15, 23, 26, 1]
- Node 13: Neighbors [29, 7, 25]
- Node 14: Neighbors [27, 2, 24]
- Node 15: Neighbors [12, 11]
- Node 16: Neighbors [0, 28, 26]
- Node 17: Neighbors [11, 28, 7]
- Node 18: Neighbors [19, 2, 1, 6]
- Node 19: Neighbors [27, 18, 5, 29, 7]
- Node 20: Neighbors [27, 2, 4]
- Node 21: Neighbors [11, 2, 4]
- Node 22: Neighbors [27, 5, 23, 8, 25]
- Node 23: Neighbors [22, 0, 12]
- Node 24: Neighbors [6, 14]
- Node 25: Neighbors [22, 13, 4, 9]
- Node 26: Neighbors [16, 3, 12]
- Node 27: Neighbors [14, 19, 20, 22]
- Node 28: Neighbors [5, 16, 17]
- Node 29: Neighbors [19, 13]

Nodes 2, 5, 12, 19, 22 have more than three neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 32. 

Listing the unique 3-stars, we have:
<2, (18, 20, 14, 21)>, <5, (22, 6, 19, 28)>, <12, (15, 23, 26, 1)>, <19, (27, 18, 5, 29)>, <22, (27, 5, 23, 8, 25)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
