This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 26) (3, 14) (25, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 2) (21, 25) (21, 18) (0, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 7) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 6) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 8) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 23) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 4) (16, 5) (16, 13) (8, 6) (8, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 24) (4, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 15) (15, 14) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 22) (10, 0) (10, 29) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 24) (20, 9) (20, 22) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 20) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 14, 15, 18, 28
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 12, 24, 29, 11
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 12, 16, 2
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 27, 5, 8, 28
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 27, 2, 17
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 14, 29, 1, 22
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 14, 29, 13, 22, 26
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 21, 2, 23, 1
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 15, 17, 20
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 26, 11, 4, 23
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 17, 11, 8, 24
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 7, 0, 12, 6
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 9
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 17, 4, 10, 15

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 
    - Node 1 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <1, (14, 15, 18)>, <1, (14, 15, 28)>, <1, (14, 18, 28)>, <1, (15, 18, 28)>
    - Node 4 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <4, (12, 24, 29)>, <4, (12, 24, 11)>, <4, (12, 29, 11)>, <4, (24, 29, 11)>
    - Node 5 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <5, (6, 12, 16)>, <5, (6, 12, 2)>, <5, (6, 16, 2)>, <5, (12, 16, 2)>
    - Node 6 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <6, (27, 5, 8)>, <6, (27, 5, 28)>, <6, (27, 8, 28)>, <6, (5, 8, 28)>
    - Node 18 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <18, (21, 2, 23)>, <18, (21, 2, 1)>, <18, (21, 23, 1)>, <18, (2, 23, 1)>
    - Node 24 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <24, (26, 11, 4)>, <24, (26, 11, 23)>, <24, (26, 4, 23)>, <24, (11, 4, 23)>
    - Node 27 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <27, (7, 12, 6)>, <27, (7, 12, 0)>, <27, (7, 6, 0)>, <27, (12, 6, 0)>
    - Node 1 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <1, (6, 18, 28)>, <1, (6, 18, 1)>, <1, (6, 28, 1)>, <1, (18, 28, 1)>
    - Node 26 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <26, (17, 11, 8)>, <26, (17, 11, 24)>, <26, (17, 8, 24)>, <26, (11, 8, 24)>
    - Node 29 can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
        - <29, (17, 4, 10)>, <29, (17, 4, 15)>, <29, (17, 10, 15)>, <29, (4, 10, 15)>
- For node with 5 neighbors:
    - Node 17 can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
        - <17, (14, 29, 13)>, <17, (14, 29, 22)>, <17, (14, 13, 22)>, <17, (29, 13, 22)>, <17, (14, 13, 26)>, <17, (14, 22, 26)>, <17, (13, 22, 26)>, <17, (14, 29, 26)>, <17, (29, 13, 26)>, <17, (29, 22, 26)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 46 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
