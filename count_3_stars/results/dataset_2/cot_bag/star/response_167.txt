Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

So, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (0, 1, 14)>, <3, (0, 6, 13)>, <3, (1, 4, 14)>, <3, (5, 7, 10)>, <3, (6, 10, 14)>, <4, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 9, 10)>, <7, (0, 5, 13)>, <10, (6, 12, 14)>, <13, (0, 6, 10)>, <13, (0, 6, 14)>, <13, (6, 10, 14)>, <14, (1, 4, 12)>
