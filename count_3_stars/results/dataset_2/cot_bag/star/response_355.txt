Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get:

\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 94 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].
