Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 23) (15, 5) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (25, 26) (25, 23) (25, 28) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 24) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 14) (12, 7) (19, 17) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 10) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 16) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 11) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 27) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 20) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 29) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 12: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 13: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 14: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 15: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 18: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 20: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 22: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 24: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 25: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 26: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 28: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 29: C(3, 3) = 1

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 52
Therefore, the final answer is [52].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 28, 5)>, <0, (1, 29, 5)>, <0, (21, 1, 28)>, <0, (21, 1, 5)>, <1, (0, 28, 5)>, <2, (9, 22, 4)>, <2, (11, 9, 2)>, <4, (15, 22, 5)>, <5, (0, 15, 29)>, <8, (13, 9, 18)>, <9, (0, 16, 10)>, <13, (8, 11, 18)>, <14, (17, 12, 23)>, <16, (10, 29, 20)>, <22, (9, 24, 5)>, <22, (2, 24, 20)>, <23, (3, 25, 14)>, <25, (23, 26, 28)>.
