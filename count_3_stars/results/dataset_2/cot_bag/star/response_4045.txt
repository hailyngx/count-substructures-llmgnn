Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 3, 14
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 13, 0, 12
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 10
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 9, 0, 14, 11
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 7, 3, 14, 2, 12
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 2
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 0, 6, 10, 5
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, 11
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 7, 14, 2
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 14, 9, 12
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 5
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 14
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors: 4, 13, 0, 11, 5, 10

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes mentioned above:

- Nodes 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 2 and 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 1, 6, 9, and 10 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( (10 \times 5) + (4 \times 2) + (1 \times 4) = 50 + 8 + 4 = 62 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 7, 14)>
- <4, (0, 7, 14)>
- <7, (4, 0, 6)>
- <11, (4, 13, 14)>
- <14, (4, 13, 0)>
