Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with the number of their neighbors:
Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 1 neighbor
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 60

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 0, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (6, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 5, 1)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 0)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 7, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
