Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. From the provided information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 0: It has neighbors 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1: It has neighbors 0, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 2: It has neighbors 7, 11, 12, and 13. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 3: It has neighbors 1, 4, 9, and 14. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 4: It has neighbors 0, 3, 7, and 9. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 5: It has neighbors 11, 12, and 13. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 7: It has neighbors 2, 4, 6, and 14. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 8: It has neighbors 1, 6, 12, 13, and 14. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 9: It has neighbors 0, 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 12: It has neighbors 0, 2, 5, 11 and 13. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 13: It has neighbors 2, 5, 8, and 12. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 14: It has neighbors 1, 3, 7, and 8. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.

Putting all these together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 14>
<2, 7, 13>
<4, 7, 14>
<5, 12, 13>
<6, 7, 14>
<8, 12, 13>
<9, 0, 4>
<11, 12, 5>
<13, 2, 8>
<14, 3, 1>
