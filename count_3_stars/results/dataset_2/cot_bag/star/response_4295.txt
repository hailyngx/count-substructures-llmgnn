Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Based on the information above, we can find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 8.
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 5.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 4 and nodes 2, 3, 9.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 9.
- Node 4 can form 2 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 5 and 4, 6, 8.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 6.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 4 and nodes 4, 5, 9.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 6.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 0, 1>
- <2, 0, 4>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <4, 2, 3>
- <4, 4, 6>
- <6, 0, 1>
- <6, 1, 4>
- <6, 4, 5>
- <6, 4, 9>
- <9, 2, 3>
