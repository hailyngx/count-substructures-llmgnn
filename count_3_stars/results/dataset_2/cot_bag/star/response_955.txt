Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 3) (26, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (0, 20) (0, 19) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 4) (20, 28) (17, 29) (17, 13) (29, 17) (29, 1) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 7) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 27) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 27) (2, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 6) (15, 18) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 25) (23, 16) (21, 27) (21, 12) (27, 1) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 11) (25, 22) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 23) (25, 16) (24, 1) (24, 7) (10, 18) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 20) (4, 11) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, and 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53 \)

Therefore, there are 53 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [53].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, 8, 28>, <5, 13, 25>, <5, 12, 21>, <5, 12, 11>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 5, 28>, <12, 5, 21>, <12, 21, 27>, <13, 17, 29>, <13, 5, 25>, <15, 18, 22>, <18, 22, 5>, <22, 5, 13>, <22, 25, 16>, <25, 14, 18>, <27, 1, 29>.
