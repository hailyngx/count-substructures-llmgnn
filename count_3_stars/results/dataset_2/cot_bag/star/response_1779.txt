Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 10, 12, 8
- Node 1: 5, 9, 4, 11, 13, 8
- Node 2: 4, 12, 3
- Node 3: 14, 2, 12
- Node 4: 5, 7, 14, 1, 2
- Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 11, 10
- Node 6: 7, 12, 8
- Node 7: 4, 0, 11, 6, 13
- Node 8: 5, 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 10, 1
- Node 10: 5, 9, 11, 0
- Node 11: 5, 7, 10, 1
- Node 12: 0, 2, 3, 6, 13
- Node 13: 7, 14, 12, 1
- Node 14: 4, 3, 13

To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48, Therefore, there are 48 3-stars in this graph.

In this graph, the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 13)>
- <1, (4, 13, 14)>
- <1, (5, 8, 10)>
- <4, (1, 5, 11)>
- <4, (1, 5, 13)>
- <4, (2, 3, 12)>
- <5, (1, 4, 11)>
- <5, (1, 4, 13)>
- <5, (1, 8, 10)>
- <7, (4, 11, 13)>
- <7, (6, 8, 12)>
- <1, (11, 13, 14)>
- <12, (2, 3, 14)>
- <12, (2, 6, 13)>
- <12, (3, 6, 13)>
- <12, (6, 8, 13)>
- <13, (1, 4, 7)>
- <13, (1, 7, 14)>
- <13, (3, 7, 14)>
- <13, (7, 12, 14)>
