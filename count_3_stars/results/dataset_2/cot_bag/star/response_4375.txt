Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 3, 4, 1, 15, 16, 9, 6, 13, 10, 14, and 0. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (15, 4, 9). The number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (3, 6, 18, 2). The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (6, 14, 9, 7). The number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 15 has 7 neighbors: (3, 8, 13, 5, 16, 0, 7). The number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).
- Node 16 has 6 neighbors: (7, 0, 15, 19, 17, 2). The number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (3, 1, 0, 8, 9). The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 17). The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (15, 7, 12). The number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: (11, 12). Node 10 cannot form any 3-star as it does not have at least 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (1, 0, 5). The number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (14, 16, 9, 10). The number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 81\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (15, 4, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 18)>
- <1, (6, 14, 9)>
- <15, (3, 8, 13)>
- <16, (7, 0, 15)>
- <9, (3, 1, 0)>
- <6, (1, 4, 17)>
- <13, (15, 7, 12)>
- <14, (1, 0, 5)>
