Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 10, 11, 14
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 11
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9, 11, 12
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 6, 9, 14
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9, 13
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 13, 14
- Node 7: 5, 9, 10, 12
- Node 8: 13
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7, 12
- Node 10: 0, 7, 11
- Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 10, 13
- Node 12: 2, 7, 9, 13, 14
- Node 13: 5, 6, 8, 11, 12
- Node 14: 0, 4, 6, 12

From the list above, we can see that nodes 5, 9, and 13 have 4 neighbors each, which means they can form 4 3-stars each. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[
[4 \times \binom{4}{3} + 7 \times \binom{5}{3}] = [4 \times 4 + 7 \times 10] = [16 + 70] = [86]
\]

Therefore, there are 86 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 12)>
<13, (6, 11, 12)>
<0, (1, 10, 11)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<2, (3, 6, 12)>
<6, (2, 4, 14)>
<7, (5, 10, 12)>
<11, (0, 10, 13)>
<12, (7, 9, 13)>
