Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+1+1] = [30] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>.
