Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are five nodes that have three or more neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, we have 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 1, we have 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 2, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 4, we have 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
For node 8, we have 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.

Summing these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 64 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 1, 2)>
