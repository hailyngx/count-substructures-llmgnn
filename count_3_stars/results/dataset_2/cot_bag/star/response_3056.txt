Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 15) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 15) (12, 16) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 19) (13, 17) (13, 0) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31 \).
So, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (13, 17, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (17, 15, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 19)>
<4, (6, 18, 3)>
<6, (7, 4, 19)>
<7, (6, 11, 8)>
<8, (1, 19, 9)>
<9, (8, 15, 17)>
<11, (1, 7, 10)>
<14, (0, 18, 16)>
<15, (2, 9, 17)>
<16, (12, 14, 15)>
<17, (0, 15, 13)>
<19, (0, 3, 8)>
