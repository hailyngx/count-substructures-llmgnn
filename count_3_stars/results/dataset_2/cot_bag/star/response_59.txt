Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 19) (16, 28) (16, 8) (26, 27) (26, 5) (26, 20) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 26) (6, 19) (6, 20) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 22) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 22) (25, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) (20, 26) (20, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (19, 27) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 29) (13, 15) (24, 1) (24, 17) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 7) (14, 4) (14, 23) (22, 28) (22, 17) (22, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of 68 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and some of the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (10, 12, 25)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 7, 11)>
- <10, (1, 11, 25)>
- <11, (3, 8, 23)>
- <17, (0, 22, 24)>
- <19, (2, 6, 27)>
- <22, (0, 17, 28)>
- <23, (3, 14, 25)>
- <25, (21, 23, 29)>
- <26, (5, 6, 20)>
- <28, (16, 17, 29)>
- <29, (13, 15, 25)>
