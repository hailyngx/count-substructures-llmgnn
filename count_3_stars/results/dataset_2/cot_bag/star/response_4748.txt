Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can draw the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described. 

Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 2
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 1, 6
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 2
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 1, 4, 3
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 7, 0, 3, 2, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 1, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 0, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [52]. The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<5, (8, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 2, 3)>
<6, (7, 0, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>
