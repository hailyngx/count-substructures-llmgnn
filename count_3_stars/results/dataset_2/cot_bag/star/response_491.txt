Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (2, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (5, 11, 14)>, 
<10, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<11, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<13, (0, 1, 3)>.
