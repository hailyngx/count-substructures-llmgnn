Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 2, 5, 9, 12  
3: 2, 5  
10: 11, 0, 7, 2, 5, 14  
11: 10, 14, 7  
4: 8, 13, 14, 2  
8: 4, 9  
2: 1, 3, 10, 4, 7  
5: 1, 3, 10, 13  
13: 4, 5, 14, 0, 6  
9: 1, 8, 7, 12  
0: 10, 13, 6  
14: 10, 11, 4, 13, 6, 12  
7: 10, 11, 2, 9  
6: 13, 0, 14, 12  
12: 1, 9, 14, 6  

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:  
Total number of 3-stars = [15 choose 3] = 455  
There are 3-stars with the following unique node sets:  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (2, 5, 12)>  
<1, (5, 9, 12)>  
<2, (1, 10, 7)>  
<2, (3, 5, 10)>  
<2, (4, 7, 10)>  
<2, (7, 9, 10)>  
<2, (10, 13, 14)>  
<10, (0, 13, 14)>  
<10, (7, 11, 14)>  
<4, (8, 13, 14)>  
<5, (3, 10, 13)>  
<9, (1, 7, 12)>  
<13, (0, 6, 14)>  
<14, (6, 12, 13)>
