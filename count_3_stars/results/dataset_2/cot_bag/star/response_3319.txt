Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: We have 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 10, and 14), so the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<1, (4, 10, 14)>

For node 2: We have 6 neighbors (nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), so the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 10, 11)>, <2, (7, 8, 11)>, <2, (7, 9, 11)>, <2, (7, 8, 10)>, <2, (7, 9, 10)>, <2, (8, 9, 10)>, <2, (7, 8, 12)>, <2, (7, 9, 12)>, <2, (7, 10, 12)>, <2, (7, 11, 12)>, <2, (8, 9, 12)>, <2, (8, 10, 11)>, <2, (9, 10, 12)>, <2, (9, 11, 12)>, <2, (10, 11, 12)>, <2, (8, 9, 11)>, <2, (8, 10, 12)>, <2, (9, 10, 11)>, <2, (10, 11, 12)>

For node 3: We have 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 12, and 13), so the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<3, (5, 12, 13)>, <3, (5, 6, 12)>, <3, (5, 12, 14)>, <3, (5, 6, 13)>

For node 5: We have 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 12, 13, and 14), so the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<5, (3, 12, 13)>, <5, (3, 12, 14)>, <5, (3, 13, 14)>, <5, (12, 13, 14)>

For node 6: We have 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 13), so the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<6, (0, 7, 13)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 13)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 7, 13)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 13)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 13)>, <6, (4, 7, 13)>

For node 7: We have 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 10, 11, and 12), so the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<7, (2, 10, 11)>, <7, (2, 10, 12)>, <7, (2, 11, 12)>, <7, (6, 10, 11)>, <7, (6, 10, 12)>, <7, (6, 11, 12)>, <7, (10, 11, 12)>, <7, (2, 6, 10)>, <7, (2, 6, 11)>, <7, (2, 6, 12)>

For node 10: We have 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 12, and 7), so the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<10, (0, 1, 12)>, <10, (0, 1, 7)>, <10, (0, 7, 12)>, <10, (1, 2, 7)>, <10, (1, 2, 12)>, <10, (2, 7, 12)>, <10, (0, 2, 7)>, <10, (0, 2, 12)>, <10, (0, 1, 2)>, <10, (1, 7, 12)>

For node 11: We have 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 7, and 14), so the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<11, (2, 7, 14)>, <11, (2, 6, 7)>, <11, (2, 6, 14)>, <11, (7, 6, 14)>

For node 12: We have 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 14), so the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
<12, (0, 5, 14)>, <12, (0, 10, 14)>, <12, (0, 2, 14)>, <12, (2, 5, 14)>, <12, (0, 2, 5)>, <12, (0, 5, 10)>, <12, (0, 2, 10)>, <12, (0, 2, 3)>, <12, (0, 3, 5)>, <12, (5, 14, 10)>, <12, (5, 14, 2)>, <12, (2, 10, 14)>, <12, (2, 5, 10)>, <12, (2, 3, 5)>, <12, (2, 3, 14)>, <12, (3, 5, 14)>, <12, (10, 2, 5)>, <12, (10, 5, 14)>, <12, (5, 10, 14)>, <12, (0, 3, 14)>

For node 14: We have 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 11, 12, and 12), so the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<14, (1, 11, 12)>, <14, (1, 12, 5)>, <14, (11, 5, 12)>, <14, (11, 12, 5)>, <14, (1, 5, 12)>, <14, (1, 5, 11)>, <14, (1, 11, 5)>, <14, (1, 11, 7)>, <14, (1, 5, 7)>, <14, (1, 7, 12)>

There are a total of 80 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [80].
