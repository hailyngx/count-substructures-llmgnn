Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (26, 15) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 25) (21, 14) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 25) (20, 5) (20, 10) (20, 16) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 22) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (22, 9) (22, 28) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 24) (13, 3) (13, 18) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 7) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 2) (4, 27) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (8, 3) (23, 27) (23, 11) (23, 18) (16, 20) (16, 29) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (18, 13) (18, 23) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 3) (24, 13) (24, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (10, 14) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 13.

For node 5:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 20, and 17: <5, (12, 20, 17)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 13, and 17: <5, (12, 13, 17)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, and 3: <13, (8, 19, 3)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 24, and 2: <13, (3, 24, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4, and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (12, 20, 17)>, <5, (12, 13, 17)>, <13, (8, 19, 3)>, <13, (3, 24, 2)>. So, the final answer is [4].
