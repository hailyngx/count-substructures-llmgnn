Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the graph. Let's analyze the nodes to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].
