Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 16) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 1) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 15) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with the number of neighbors they have:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (9, 12, 2, 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 13, 12)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (6, 0, 13, 12, 11)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (19, 7)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (17, 18, 11, 15)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (10, 13, 1)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (9, 14, 16, 3)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (15, 7, 0)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (19, 5)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (4, 18, 2, 15)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (17, 0, 2, 1)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (5, 2, 1)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (7, 16)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (9, 4, 11, 16)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (14, 19, 7, 15)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (12, 4)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (4, 11)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (10, 3, 16)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 9, 12>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 12, 2>, <0, 12, 1>, <0, 12, 13>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 13, 5>, <2, 13, 1>, <2, 13, 12>, <2, 13, 0>, <2, 12, 17>, <2, 12, 0>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 1>, <7, 9, 14>, <7, 9, 16>, <7, 9, 3>, <7, 16, 14>, <7, 16, 15>, <7, 16, 3>, <9, 15, 4>, <9, 15, 11>, <9, 15, 16>, <11, 4, 18>, <11, 4, 15>, <11, 4, 2>, <11, 18, 4>, <11, 18, 2>, <11, 18, 15>, <15, 16, 14>, <15, 16, 1> 

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets gives [35].
