Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 18) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 23) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 3) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 22) (24, 21) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 20) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 27) (19, 17) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 29) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 4) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 28) (23, 13) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (28, 10) (28, 22) (1, 10) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 12) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 19) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 14) (21, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 27) (27, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 21) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (15, 29) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 14) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 22) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 22) (22, 24) (22, 28) (22, 20) (22, 6) (22, 7) (4, 16) (4, 25) (14, 25) (14, 15) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 29) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars originating from each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars from each eligible node: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \).

Therefore, there are a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 2, 16>, <0, 2, 10>, <0, 16, 25>, <0, 16, 4>, <2, 3, 26>, <5, 21, 27>, <8, 18, 13>, <10, 0, 27>, <10, 27, 20>, <10, 27, 21>, <11, 13, 23>, <12, 3, 29>, <13, 11, 23>, <13, 18, 8>, <13, 18, 7>, <13, 18, 8>, <15, 6, 22>, <15, 9, 7>, <16, 0, 25>, <21, 24, 22>, <22, 6, 15>, <22, 20, 27>, <24, 26, 3>, <24, 26, 17>, <24, 26, 3>, <25, 14, 15>, <27, 5, 21>, <27, 5, 29>, <27, 10, 21>, <27, 20, 11>, <28, 10, 22>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
