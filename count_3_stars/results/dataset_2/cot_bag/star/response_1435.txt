Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 11, 12}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {6, 2, 14, 0}
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {13, 2, 5, 12, 7}
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {8, 11, 3, 1, 0}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {8, 12}
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {6, 8, 7, 14, 3}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {9, 8, 1}
Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {9, 13, 14, 10, 3}
Node 14 has 6 neighbors: {9, 12, 0, 3, 1, 10}
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {8, 10}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {13, 12, 0, 14}
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: {6, 13, 4}
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {6, 13, 2, 14}
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {0, 14, 5, 4}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {11, 1, 10}

There are a total of 10 nodes that have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 11)>, <6, (9, 1, 12)>, <6, (9, 11, 12)>, <6, (1, 11, 12)>
Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (6, 2, 14)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 14, 0)>, <9, (2, 14, 0)>
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <8, (13, 2, 5)>, <8, (13, 2, 12)>, <8, (13, 2, 7)>, <8, (13, 5, 12)>, <8, (13, 5, 7)>, <8, (13, 12, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 12)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 12, 7)>, <8, (5, 12, 7)>
Node 13 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <13, (8, 11, 3)>, <13, (8, 11, 1)>, <13, (8, 11, 0)>, <13, (8, 3, 1)>, <13, (8, 3, 0)>, <13, (8, 1, 0)>, <13, (11, 3, 1)>, <13, (11, 3, 0)>, <13, (11, 1, 0)>, <13, (3, 1, 0)>
Node 12 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <12, (6, 8, 7)>, <12, (6, 8, 14)>, <12, (6, 7, 14)>, <12, (8, 7, 14)>, <12, (8, 7, 3)>, <12, (8, 14, 3)>, <12, (7, 14, 3)>, <12, (7, 14, 3)>, <12, (6, 7, 3)>, <12, (6, 14, 3)>
Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <0, (9, 13, 14)>, <0, (9, 13, 10)>, <0, (9, 13, 3)>, <0, (9, 14, 10)>, <0, (9, 14, 3)>, <0, (9, 10, 3)>, <0, (13, 14, 10)>, <0, (13, 14, 3)>, <0, (13, 10, 3)>, <0, (14, 10, 3)>
Node 14 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <14, (9, 12, 3)>, <14, (9, 12, 1)>, <14, (9, 12, 10)>, <14, (9, 12, 4)>, <14, (12, 3, 1)>, <14, (12, 3, 10)>, <14, (12, 3, 4)>, <14, (12, 1, 10)>, <14, (12, 1, 4)>, <14, (12, 10, 4)>, <14, (3, 1, 10)>, <14, (3, 1, 4)>, <14, (3, 10, 4)>, <14, (1, 10, 4)>, <14, (9, 3, 1)>, <14, (9, 3, 10)>, <14, (9, 3, 4)>, <14, (9, 1, 10)>, <14, (9, 1, 4)>, <14, (9, 10, 4)>
Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <10, (0, 14, 5)>, <10, (0, 14, 4)>, <10, (0, 5, 4)>, <10, (14, 5, 4)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4] = 62 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of unique 3-stars is [62].
