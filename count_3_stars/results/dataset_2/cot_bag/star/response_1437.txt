Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 15) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 8) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 12) (6, 3) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges in this graph.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 13
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 19
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 16, 18
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 14
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 7, 13, 17
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 15
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 0, 9, 16
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 8, 17, 18
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 12
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 5, 13, 17, 19
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 16, 10
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 5, 14, 3
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 16

Calculating the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 11 \]

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
\[ <0, (2, 4, 13)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 16, 18)>, <8, (3, 11, 14)>, <9, (7, 13, 17)>, <12, (4, 6, 15)>, <13, (0, 9, 16)>, <14, (8, 17, 18)>, <15, (1, 11, 12)>, <16, (5, 13, 17)> \]

Therefore, the final answer is: [11].
