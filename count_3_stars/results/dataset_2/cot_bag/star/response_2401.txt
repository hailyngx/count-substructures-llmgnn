Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (19, 2) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 8, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 5}
- Node 10: {2}
- Node 11: {2, 4}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 17}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 12, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {7, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {8, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 5}
- Node 19: {2}

There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors.

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 * 3 = 3 3-stars
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3 * 4 = 12 3-stars
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 8 * 10 = 80 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is 3 + 12 + 80 = 95.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 15)>
<2, (6, 10, 18)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (11, 12, 13)>
<7, (12, 15, 16)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<12, (4, 7, 15)>
<13, (3, 4, 14)>
<15, (1, 7, 12)>
<16, (7, 12, 15)>
<17, (8, 14, 15)>
<18, (2, 5, 6)>
<19, (2, 10, 18)>

The final number of 3-stars is [95].
