Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 25) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 20) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (12, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 6) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 20) (18, 3) (18, 26) (25, 1) (25, 9) (25, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 22) (8, 0) (8, 9) (19, 22) (19, 6) (22, 17) (22, 19) (9, 25) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 23) (10, 15) (10, 28) (10, 6) (11, 15) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 16) (20, 4) (20, 26) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 23) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ [20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [67] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (17, 15, 28)>
- <15, (3, 10, 21)>
- <1, (21, 26, 14)>
- <14, (26, 0, 21)>
- <13, (4, 17, 9)>
- <9, (25, 23, 13)>
- <5, (25, 23, 24)>
- <23, (14, 9, 16)>
- <16, (15, 4, 13)>
