Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 15) (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 21) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 27) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 21) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 21) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 5) (22, 0) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 29) (25, 17) (25, 16) (27, 17) (27, 29) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (21, 15) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 16) (23, 19) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 19) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 16) (18, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 12) (19, 18) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 5) (24, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 22) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 24) (5, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 14) (13, 24) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors: (15, 17, 22, 0)
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors: (1, 7, 24, 2)
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors: (7, 17, 20, 28)
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors: (3, 22, 24, 10)
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors: (6, 13, 5)
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors: (16, 24, 19)
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors: (14, 24, 10)
- Node 14 with 3 neighbors: (26, 17, 13)
- Node 15 with 4 neighbors: (26, 0, 18, 21)
- Node 16 with 5 neighbors: (25, 21, 12, 18, 19)
- Node 17 with 5 neighbors: (14, 20, 25, 0, 27)
- Node 18 with 4 neighbors: (15, 28, 16, 19)
- Node 19 with 5 neighbors: (28, 12, 23, 18, 16)
- Node 21 with 4 neighbors: (15, 8, 16, 29)
- Node 22 with 4 neighbors: (26, 28, 5, 0)
- Node 24 with 4 neighbors: (12, 13, 5, 2)
- Node 26 with 4 neighbors: (22, 14, 15, 29)
- Node 28 with 4 neighbors: (4, 29, 18, 22)
- Node 29 with 4 neighbors: (9, 20, 27, 21)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (15, 17, 22, 0)>, <2, (1, 7, 24, 2)>, <4, (7, 17, 20, 28)>, <5, (3, 22, 24, 10)>, <10, (6, 13, 5)>, <12, (16, 24, 19)>, <13, (14, 24, 10)>, <14, (26, 17, 13)>, <15, (26, 0, 18, 21)>, <16, (25, 21, 12, 18, 19)>, <17, (14, 20, 25, 0, 27)>, <18, (15, 28, 16, 19)>, <19, (28, 12, 23, 18, 16)>, <21, (15, 8, 16, 29)>, <22, (26, 28, 5, 0)>, <24, (12, 13, 5, 2)>, <26, (22, 14, 15, 29)>, <28, (4, 29, 18, 22)>, <29, (9, 20, 27, 21)>.
