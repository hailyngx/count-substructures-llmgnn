Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 6, 8, 13, 10, 3, 0, 14, and 2. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <6, (9, 3, 10)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 8)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <6, (3, 8, 10)>, <6, (3, 8, 13)>, <6, (3, 10, 13)>, <6, (8, 10, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 3)>

2. Node 8 has 6 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
   <8, (6, 13, 12)>, <8, (6, 13, 11)>, <8, (6, 13, 7)>, <8, (6, 12, 11)>, <8, (6, 12, 7)>, <8, (6, 11, 7)>, <8, (13, 12, 11)>, <8, (13, 12, 7)>, <8, (13, 11, 7)>, <8, (12, 11, 7)>, and so on...

3. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <13, (6, 8, 12)>, <13, (6, 8, 11)>, <13, (6, 8, 7)>, <13, (8, 12, 11)>

4. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <10, (6, 11, 14)>, <10, (6, 11, 4)>, <10, (6, 14, 4)>, <10, (11, 14, 4)>, <10, (9, 0, 4)>, <10, (9, 0, 2)>, <10, (9, 4, 2)>, <10, (0, 4, 2)>, <10, (0, 14, 2)>, <10, (14, 4, 2)>

5. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (9, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (8, 4, 2)>, <3, (4, 2, 2)>

6. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <0, (9, 1, 14)>, <0, (9, 1, 7)>, <0, (9, 14, 7)>, <0, (1, 14, 7)>, <0, (10, 14, 7)>, <0, (10, 7, 2)>, <0, (10, 14, 2)>, <0, (14, 7, 2)>, <0, (14, 2, 7)>, <0, (7, 2, 14)>

7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <14, (8, 10, 2)>, <14, (0, 2, 7)>, <14, (0, 2, 4)>, <14, (2, 7, 4)>

8. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <2, (10, 14, 7)>, <2, (10, 14, 4)>, <2, (10, 7, 4)>, <2, (14, 7, 4)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives \[ [10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [78] \]
