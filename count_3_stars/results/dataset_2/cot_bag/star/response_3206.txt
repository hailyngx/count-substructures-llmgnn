Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 14) (16, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 28) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 29) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 29) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (26, 7) (26, 1) (26, 12) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 25) (17, 11) (17, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 6) (25, 7) (25, 2) (25, 18) (25, 19) (23, 27) (23, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 28) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 10) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 29) (19, 9) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 5) (6, 0) (6, 15) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (29, 21) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 15) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 12) (10, 22) (27, 16) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 27) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 29) (22, 20) (22, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then count the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 20: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 25: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 28: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 29: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 7, 18>
- <0, 7, 21>
- <0, 7, 25>
- <0, 7, 28>
- <0, 25, 28>
- <1, 3, 21>
- <3, 21, 29>
- <10, 18, 25>
- <15, 13, 29>
- <19, 9, 29>
- <20, 14, 28>
