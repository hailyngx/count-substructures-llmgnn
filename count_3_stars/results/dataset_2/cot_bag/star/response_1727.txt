Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 42. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 4)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 2, 9)>, <0, (6, 4, 7)>, <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <7, (8, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 3, 4)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <7, (9, 6, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 3)>, <9, (2, 0, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (2, 6, 0)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].
