Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

1: 9, 3, 5  
2: 9, 3, 4, 8, 7  
3: 6, 1, 2, 8  
4: 8, 0, 5, 2  
5: 6, 1, 4, 0  
6: 5, 7, 3  
7: 6, 9, 8, 2  
8: 3, 4, 2, 0, 7  
9: 2, 1, 7, 0  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 3, 5)>  
<2, (9, 4, 8)>  
<2, (9, 3, 7)>  
<2, (3, 4, 8)>  
<2, (3, 8, 7)>  
<3, (6, 1, 2)>  
<3, (6, 2, 8)>  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>  
<3, (1, 8, 7)>  
<4, (8, 0, 5)>  
<4, (0, 5, 6)>  
<5, (6, 1, 4)>  
<7, (6, 9, 2)>  
<8, (3, 4, 0)>  
<8, (3, 0, 5)>  
<8, (4, 0, 5)>
