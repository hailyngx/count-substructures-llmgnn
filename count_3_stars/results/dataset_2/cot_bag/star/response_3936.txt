Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are:  
- Node 4 with neighbors 16, 20, 15, and 21  
- Node 6 with neighbors 9, 10, 25, and 20  
- Node 8 with neighbors 10, 23, 24, and 0  
- Node 9 with neighbors 26, 6, and 27  
- Node 15 with neighbors 4, 24, 5, and 25  
- Node 20 with neighbors 4, 6, 27, and 28  
- Node 21 with neighbors 4, 23, 16, 12, and 29  
- Node 22 with neighbors 26, 7, and 18  
- Node 23 with neighbors 8, 2, 21, and 28  
- Node 28 with neighbors 18, 23, 20, and 13  
- Node 29 with neighbors 7, 11, 18, 21, and 1  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- For node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \Rightarrow [1]\)  
- For node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 20: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 21: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \Rightarrow [10]\)  
- For node 22: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \Rightarrow [1]\)  
- For node 23: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 28: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \Rightarrow [4]\)  
- For node 29: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \Rightarrow [10]\)  

Summing up these numbers, we get:  
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44 \]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [44] \).  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<4, (16, 20, 15)>  
<6, (9, 10, 25)>  
<8, (10, 23, 24)>  
<9, (26, 6, 27)>  
<15, (4, 24, 5)>  
<20, (4, 6, 27)>  
<21, (23, 16, 12)>  
<22, (26, 7, 18)>  
<23, (8, 21, 28)>  
<29, (7, 11, 18)>
