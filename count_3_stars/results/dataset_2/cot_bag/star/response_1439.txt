Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 14.
Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars from each node with 3 or more neighbors:
\[ 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 77 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].
