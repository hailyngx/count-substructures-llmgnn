Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 17) (11, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 14) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (18, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <0, (12, 14, 9)>
  <0, (12, 2, 4)>
  <0, (14, 12, 9)>
  <0, (14, 2, 9)>

- Node 1: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <1, (5, 17, 6)>
  <1, (5, 17, 2)>
  <1, (5, 17, 3)>
  <1, (6, 17, 5)>

- Node 2: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\)
  <2, (5, 19, 16)>
  <2, (5, 19, 6)>
  <2, (5, 19, 0)>
  <2, (5, 19, 16)>
  <2, (5, 16, 19)>
  <2, (16, 19, 2)>
  <2, (16, 19, 6)>
  <2, (16, 19, 0)>
  <2, (16, 19, 5)>
  <2, (16, 19, 9)>

- Node 4: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
  <4, (7, 12, 16)>

- Node 6: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <6, (2, 18, 8)>
  <6, (2, 18, 1)>
  <6, (2, 18, 6)>
  <6, (2, 18, 14)>

- Node 8: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <8, (6, 14, 19)>
  <8, (6, 14, 12)>
  <8, (6, 14, 0)>
  <8, (6, 14, 8)>

- Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <9, (15, 0, 16)>
  <9, (15, 0, 14)>
  <9, (15, 0, 9)>
  <9, (15, 0, 7)>

- Node 12: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
  <12, (4, 16, 14)>

- Node 13: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
  <13, (15, 17, 14)>

- Node 14: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
  <14, (13, 8, 12)>

- Node 15: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
  <15, (13, 9, 17)>

- Node 16: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <16, (4, 9, 19)>
  <16, (4, 9, 16)>
  <16, (4, 9, 2)>
  <16, (4, 9, 16)>

- Node 17: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
  <17,(1, 5, 13)>
  <17,(1, 5, 2)>
  <17,(1, 5, 3)>
  <17,(3, 5, 13)>

- Node 19: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\)
  <19, (2, 16, 8)>
  <19, (2, 16, 14)>
  <19, (2, 16, 0)>
  <19, (2, 16, 9)>
  <19, (2, 16, 14)>
  <19, (16, 8, 19)>
  <19, (16, 14, 19)>
  <19, (16, 0, 19)>
  <19, (16, 9, 19)>
  <19, (16, 14, 8)>

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [47].
