Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) 

Response:
Applying the information provided, let's first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 0), 
(9, 5), (9, 11), (9, 3), 
(4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 6), 
(7, 3), 
(6, 4), (6, 14), (6, 10), (6, 13), 
(8, 4), (8, 2), 
(13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 12), (13, 3), 
(0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 3), (0, 11), 
(14, 6), (14, 0), (14, 1), (14, 2), 
(2, 8), (2, 14), (2, 12), (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 11), 
(12, 5), (12, 13), (12, 2), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 1), 
(11, 9), (11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 12), 
(3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 0), (3, 10), 
(1, 5), (1, 14), (1, 2), (1, 12), 
(10, 4), (10, 6), (10, 2), (10, 12), (10, 3)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

For each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 3-stars formed: [5]
- Node 1: 3-stars formed: [7]
- Node 2: 3-stars formed: [8]
- Node 3: 3-stars formed: [5]
- Node 4: 3-stars formed: [0]
- Node 5: 3-stars formed: [5]
- Node 6: 3-stars formed: [9]
- Node 8: 3-stars formed: [0]
- Node 9: 3-stars formed: [1]
- Node 10: 3-stars formed: [3]
- Node 11: 3-stars formed: [2]
- Node 12: 3-stars formed: [4]
- Node 13: 3-stars formed: [4]
- Node 14: 3-stars formed: [3]

Summing up all the 3-stars formed: 5 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 51

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 5, 14>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 12, 14>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 10, 4>, <2, 12, 4>, <2, 10, 6>, <2, 12, 13>, <3, 9, 11>, <3, 0, 11>, <3, 10, 12>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 10, 6>, <5, 9, 13>, <5, 12, 13>, <6, 10, 4>, <6, 13, 12>, <7, 3, 0>, <11, 9, 3>, <12, 5, 13>, <12, 11, 2>, <13, 5, 12>, <14, 0, 5>
