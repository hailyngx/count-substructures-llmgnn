Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are node 14, node 17, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 14: 
There are 4 neighbors of node 14 (nodes 17, 0, 8, and 18).
Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (17, 0, 8)>, <14, (17, 0, 18)>, <14, (17, 8, 18)>, <14, (0, 8, 18)>

Node 17:
There are 4 neighbors of node 17 (nodes 14, 0, 19, and 4).
Number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (14, 0, 19)>, <17, (14, 0, 4)>, <17, (14, 19, 4)>, <17, (0, 19, 4)>

Node 8:
There are 4 neighbors of node 8 (nodes 14, 3, 19, and 16).
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (14, 3, 19)>, <8, (14, 3, 16)>, <8, (14, 19, 16)>, <8, (3, 19, 16)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
