This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 7) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 18) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 17) (1, 20) (1, 14) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 28) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 10) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 16) (11, 2) (28, 20) (28, 9) (4, 27) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 25) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 8) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 16) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 8) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 21) (19, 2) (19, 12) (24, 14) (21, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 8) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

1: 20, 14 \\
3: 15, 16, 27 \\
4: 6, 27 \\
5: 0, 17, 22, 26, 29 \\
7: 15, 25 \\
8: 10, 12, 17 \\
9: 28, 29 \\
11: 2 \\
13: 12, 16, 25, 26 \\
18: 6, 14, 21, 27 \\
19: 2, 12 \\
20: 1, 15, 28, 29 \\
21: 18 \\
23: 17, 22 \\
24: 14 \\
25: 7, 10, 13 \\
28: 20, 9 \\
\newline

By using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors, we can find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from all the nodes, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = [24] \).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (15, 16, 27)>, <5, (0, 17, 22)>, <5, (0, 17, 26)>, <5, (0, 22, 26)>, <5, (17, 22, 26)>, <5, (0, 22, 29)>, <5, (5, 22, 26)>, <13, (12, 16, 25)>, <18, (6, 14, 21)>, <20, (1, 15, 28)>.
