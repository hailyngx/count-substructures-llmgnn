Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with k neighbors, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{k}{3} \).
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 17 each have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 12 = 16.

Hence, there are [16] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
