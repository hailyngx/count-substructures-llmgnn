Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (5, 18) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (10, 3) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 7) (14, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 18) (7, 14) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 
\(10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 9, 13)>
<3, (0, 8, 10)>
<4, (0, 8, 15)>
<6, (0, 11, 17)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<11, (6, 16, 17)>
<12, (5, 17, 19)>
<13, (1, 17, 19)>
<15, (0, 2, 4)>
<16, (11, 17, 19)>
<17, (6, 11, 13)>
<18, (1, 2, 7)>
<19, (12, 13, 14)>
