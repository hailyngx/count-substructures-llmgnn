Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 3-stars in total in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>  

Putting the final count of 3-stars in brackets: [36]
