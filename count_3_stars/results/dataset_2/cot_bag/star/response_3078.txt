Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 5) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors (9, 11, 19)
- Node 9 with 5 neighbors (6, 18, 16, 7, 12)
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors (3, 5, 13, 4)
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors (1, 17, 13)
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors (1, 8, 12, 2)
- Node 8 with 3 neighbors (4, 19, 0)
- Node 7 with 2 neighbors (9, 0)
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors (9, 10, 4)
- Node 2 with 3 neighbors (4, 15, 0)
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors (9, 11, 15)
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors (8, 7, 2, 14)
- Node 14 with 2 neighbors (0, 16)
- Node 17 with 3 neighbors (3, 16, 5)
- Node 5 with 2 neighbors (1, 17)
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors (1, 3, 10)
- Node 19 with 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 16 with 3 neighbors (9, 14, 17)
- Node 15 with 2 neighbors (2, 18)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 0 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star

After summing up the total number of 3-stars for these nodes, we get a total of 33 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [33].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
