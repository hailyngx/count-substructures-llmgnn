Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 12) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 2) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (18, 12) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars and list them, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

1. Node 1: 
   - Total neighbors: 5
   - \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

2. Node 3:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Only 1 3-star with 3 neighbors: <3, (2, 5, 10)>

3. Node 5:
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

4. Node 10:
   - Total neighbors: 4
   - \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

5. Node 12:
   - Total neighbors: 5
   - \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

6. Node 13:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Only 1 3-star with 3 neighbors: <13, (0, 1, 19)>

7. Node 16:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Only 1 3-star with 3 neighbors: <16, (11, 12, 9)>

8. Node 17:
   - Total neighbors: 5
   - \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

9. Node 19:
   - Total neighbors: 3
   - Only 1 3-star with 3 neighbors: <19, (11, 13, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [32]\).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<3, (2, 5, 10)>, <13, (0, 1, 19)>, <16, (11, 12, 9)>, <19, (11, 13, 1)>.
