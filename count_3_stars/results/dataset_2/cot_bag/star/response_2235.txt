Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

The 10 nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The 40 edges are:
(6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) 
(0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
(2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) 
(8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1)

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: {9, 4, 8, 1}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {9, 0, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {9, 5, 3, 1, 4}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {6, 0, 2, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>>
