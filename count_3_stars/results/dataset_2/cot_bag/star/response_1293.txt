Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 23) (10, 8) (10, 22) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 20) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 11) (29, 25) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 17) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 19) (16, 1) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 2) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 23) (22, 10) (22, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 17) (18, 5) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 5) (13, 15) (13, 28) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 15, 27, 0, 7, 11, 20, 25, 1, 3, 14, 12, 6, 8, 9, 22, 5, 23, 17, 13, 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
19. Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
20. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <15, (1, 13, 27)>, <27, (6, 15, 21)>, <0, (2, 7, 14)>, <7, (0, 14, 24)>, <11, (6, 19, 29)>, <20, (11, 25, 28)>, <25, (4, 20, 29)>, <1, (12, 15, 16)>, <3, (1, 4, 14)>, <14, (0, 3, 7)>, <12, (1, 2, 14)>, <6, (11, 19, 27)>, <8, (5, 9, 10)>, <9, (8, 17, 19)>, <22, (5, 10, 25)>, <5, (8, 17, 22)>, <23, (18, 19, 21)>, <17, (5, 9, 22)>.
