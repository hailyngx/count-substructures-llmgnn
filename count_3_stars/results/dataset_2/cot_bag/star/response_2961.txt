Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

\(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60\). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 9, 8)>, 
<1, (6, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (6, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (6, 7, 1)>, 
<6, (9, 1, 4)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 0)>, 
<8, (7, 4, 2)>, 
<9, (6, 1, 0)>.
