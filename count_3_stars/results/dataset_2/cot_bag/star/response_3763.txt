Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 8}
- Node 1: {14, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 5, 12, 10, 7}
- Node 3: {11}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 2, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 14, 7, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 1, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 0, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 5, 2, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 5, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {8, 5, 11, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {7}
- Node 14: {6, 1, 11}

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 2: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 4: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 5: C(6,3) = 20
- Node 6: C(6,3) = 20
- Node 7: C(6,3) = 20
- Node 8: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 9: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 10: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 11: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 12: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 14: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [107]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 10, 12)>, <4, (8, 5, 10)>, <5, (6, 2, 12)>, <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <7, (9, 2, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 12)>, <9, (6, 7, 10)>, <10, (9, 5, 12)>, <11, (9, 5, 12)>, <12, (8, 10, 5)>, <14, (6, 1, 11)>
