Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 12) (25, 2) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (18, 6) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 21) (6, 18) (6, 1) (21, 4) (21, 26) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 28) (14, 15) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 26) (10, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 9) (5, 20) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 14) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (24, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 25, and 28.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
11. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 55 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 55, which we can represent as [55].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (9, 25, 28)>, <2, (13, 17, 20)>, <4, (8, 19, 21)>, <4, (9, 6, 18)>, <8, (4, 19, 21)>, <10, (4, 26, 28)>, <12, (3, 15, 23)>, <13, (3, 18, 17)>, <15, (12, 14, 23)>, <17, (7, 13, 28)>, <20, (8, 1, 13)>, <25, (3, 7, 27)>, <28, (1, 10, 17)>
