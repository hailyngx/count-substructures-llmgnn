Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are a total of 13 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 78 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (8, 3, 1)>
- <1, (10, 7, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 13)>
- <3, (10, 6, 12)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (11, 14, 6)>
- <6, (11, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 14, 6)>
- <8, (4, 0, 12)>
- <10, (3, 1, 13)>
- <12, (3, 13, 8)>
- <13, (2, 12, 10)>
