Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 9, 10, 1, 18
Node 1: 0, 5
Node 2: 11, 13, 19
Node 3: 15, 6, 12, 8, 18
Node 4: 17
Node 5: 7, 1
Node 6: 3, 17
Node 7: 16, 5
Node 8: 9, 12, 3
Node 9: 8, 0
Node 10: 11, 0, 12, 18
Node 11: 10, 14, 2
Node 12: 15, 10, 8, 3
Node 13: 17, 2
Node 14: 15, 11, 19
Node 15: 3, 18, 14, 12
Node 16: 7, 19
Node 17: 6, 13, 4
Node 18: 3, 10, 0, 19, 15
Node 19: 16, 14, 18, 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0 --> [1]
Node 2 --> [1]
Node 3 --> [1]
Node 5 --> [1]
Node 8 --> [1]
Node 10 --> [1]
Node 12 --> [1]
Node 14 --> [1]
Node 15 --> [1]
Node 17 --> [1]
Node 18 --> [1]
Node 19 --> [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [12]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, 9, 1>
<2, 11, 13>
<3, 15, 6>
<5, 7, 16>
<8, 12, 15>
<10, 11, 14>
<17, 6, 13>
<18, 3, 10>
<19, 16, 7>
<2, 13, 17>
<14, 19, 16>
<18, 19, 2>
