Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 60

So, there are 60 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>,
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <2, (8, 9, 7)>,
<2, (8, 9, 1)>, <2, (8, 9, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>,
<7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 2)>, <7, (1, 4, 3)>,
<7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 3)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>,
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>,
<8, (1, 4, 2)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (7, 2, 4)>, <8, (7, 2, 1)>,
<8, (7, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>
