The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 2 has degree 5.
- Node 3 has degree 3.
- Node 4 has degree 3.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 6 has degree 3.
- Node 7 has degree 3.
- Node 8 has degree 3.
- Node 9 has degree 2.
- Node 10 has degree 4.
- Node 11 has degree 3.
- Node 12 has degree 1.
- Node 13 has degree 2.
- Node 14 has degree 4.
- Node 15 has degree 4.
- Node 16 has degree 2.
- Node 17 has degree 4.
- Node 18 has degree 2.
- Node 19 has degree 3.
- Node 20 has degree 2.

- Node 23 has degree 4.
- Node 24 has degree 2.
- Node 25 has degree 2.
- Node 26 has degree 3.
- Node 27 has degree 3.
- Node 28 has degree 2.
- Node 29 has degree 3.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 10: <2, (1, 7, 10)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 23, and 5: <8, (3, 23, 5)>.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 26, and 2: <10, (6, 26, 2)>.

Since all other nodes have degrees less than 3, only these three 3-stars are formed.
Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
