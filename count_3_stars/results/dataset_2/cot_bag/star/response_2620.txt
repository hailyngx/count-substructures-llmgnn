Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: There are 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so just 1 3-star.
- Node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6: There are 6 neighbors, so [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: There are 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10: There are 6 neighbors, so [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 11: There are 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12: There are 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13: There are 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14: There are 3 neighbors, so just 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of 92 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 10, 13)>, <0, (3, 13, 14)>, <0, (9, 10, 14)>, <0, (9, 10, 3)>, <0, (9, 13, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 12)>, <3, (0, 8, 10)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 13)>, <3, (6, 8, 13)>, <5, (1, 9, 12)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <6, (2, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <10, (4, 6, 12)>, <10, (4, 6, 13)>, <10, (6, 12, 13)>, <12, (7, 10, 13)>, <13, (7, 10, 12)>.
