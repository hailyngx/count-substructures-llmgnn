Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (5, 10, 13). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (9, 11, 3, 6). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (9, 4, 10, 11, 13, 2). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (9, 7, 12, 3). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (9, 13, 12, 0, 7). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (8, 13, 14, 2). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (5, 8, 4, 2, 11, 3). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (9, 3, 14, 12, 2). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (5, 4, 11, 13, 14). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (5, 0, 3, 6, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (11, 6, 1, 12). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Summing up these, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 93 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [93]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (9, 11, 3)>, <3, (9, 11, 10)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <5, (9, 12, 7)>, <6, (8, 13, 14)>, <9, (5, 4, 11)>, <11, (9, 14, 12)>, <12, (5, 11, 13)>, <13, (5, 12, 6)>, and <14, (11, 6, 1)>.
