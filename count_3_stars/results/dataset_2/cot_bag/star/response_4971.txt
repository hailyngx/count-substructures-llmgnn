Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 4, 8, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
