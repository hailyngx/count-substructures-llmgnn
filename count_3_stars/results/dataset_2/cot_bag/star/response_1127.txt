Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (9, 15) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 10) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 27) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 20) (0, 3) (0, 17) (1, 6) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (28, 6) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 21) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (19, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (27, 6) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 24) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
18. Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node gives:
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 60. So, the final answer is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 24, 27)>, <6, (1, 28, 7)>, <7, (4, 11, 20)>, <10, (1, 5, 29)>, <11, (7, 8, 16)>, <12, (1, 18, 20)>, <16, (10, 15, 8)>, <17, (2, 3, 27)>, <18, (12, 21, 23)>, <20, (7, 12, 25)>, <21, (18, 5, 29)>, <22, (5, 10, 23)>, <23, (22, 18, 27)>, <24, (4, 8, 27)>, <25, (11, 20, 29)>, <27, (17, 24, 29)>, <29, (22, 25, 10)>.
