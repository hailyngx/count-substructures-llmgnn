Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 12, 0, 14, 11, 2, 6, 10, and 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 63 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 63 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (8, 10, 14)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>, <1, (3, 11, 0)>, <3, (1, 11, 7)>, <4, (8, 11, 10)>, <8, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (9, 3, 12)>, <12, (4, 7, 14)>, <0, (9, 1, 6)>, <14, (5, 12, 13)>, <11, (3, 1, 8)>, <2, (11, 13, 6)>, <6, (12, 0, 2)>, <10, (5, 4, 2)>, <13, (4, 14, 2)> 

So, the final answer is [63].
