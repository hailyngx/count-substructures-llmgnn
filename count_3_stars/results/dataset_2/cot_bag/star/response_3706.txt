Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

1. Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
3. Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
4. Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
5. Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
7. Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 10: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
10. Node 11: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
11. Node 12: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 13: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 16: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
14. Node 21: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 22: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
16. Node 24: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 25: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
18. Node 27: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 28: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
20. Node 29: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 61 3-stars. So, the final number inside brackets is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (24, 25, 29)>
<4, (9, 24, 25)>

<7, (12, 16, 29)>
