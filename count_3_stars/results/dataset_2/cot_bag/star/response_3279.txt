Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {9, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {7, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 7, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {9, 13, 17}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {11, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {12, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 10, 11, 14}

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures:

For Node 4:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 9, 11)>, <4, (7, 13, 11)>, <4, (9, 13, 11)>

For Node 7:
- Total neighbors: 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 10, 13)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>, <7, (10, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 13, 10)>, <7, (1, 4, 10)>, <7, (1, 4, 13)>, <7, (1, 10, 13)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[4 + 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is: \[14\].
