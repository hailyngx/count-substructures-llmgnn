Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0. Therefore, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6.
2. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9.
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
5. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
6. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
7. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 2.
8. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
9. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 5.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: \[ [20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [62] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
