Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 15) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 19) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 4) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 13, 15, 2
- Node 1 has neighbors: 8, 15, 18
- Node 3 has neighbors: 9, 8, 7, 2
- Node 4 has neighbors: 9, 15, 19
- Node 5 has neighbors: 11, 8, 18
- Node 6 has neighbors: 11, 9, 0
- Node 8 has neighbors: 16, 5, 3, 1
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 4, 2, 3
- Node 10 has neighbors: 13, 7, 15
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 18, 5
- Node 15 has neighbors: 1, 10, 0, 4
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 17, 8, 18
- Node 18 has neighbors: 11, 16, 5, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 13, 15)>
- <0, (6, 13, 2)>
- <0, (6, 15, 2)>
- <0, (13, 15, 2)>
- <1, (8, 15, 18)>
- <3, (9, 8, 7)>
- <4, (9, 15, 19)>
- <5, (11, 8, 18)>
- <6, (11, 9, 0)>
- <8, (16, 5, 3)>
- <9, (6, 4, 2)>
- <9, (4, 15, 19)>
- <9, (15, 4, 19)>
- <10, (13, 7, 15)>
- <11, (16, 18, 5)>
- <15, (1, 10, 0)>
- <16, (11, 17, 8)>
- <18, (11, 16, 5)>
- <18, (16, 5, 1)>
