Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 25) (9, 10) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 16) (4, 1) (8, 24) (8, 20) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 21) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (11, 28) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 29) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (19, 22) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 24) (12, 22) (7, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 3) (24, 8) (24, 16) (24, 19) (24, 2) (27, 13) (27, 6) (29, 26) (29, 3) (29, 18) (2, 17) (2, 24) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 25) (25, 9) (25, 1) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 6) (14, 9) (14, 28) (14, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 29, 6)>, <1, (25, 4, 22)>, <3, (7, 5, 0)>, <6, (27, 10, 26)>, <13, (19, 21, 27)>, <14, (21, 28, 9)>, <15, (23, 20, 18)>, <16, (24, 17, 21)>, <18, (29, 26, 15)>, <19, (24, 13, 22)>, <20, (1, 15, 8)>, <21, (16, 13, 14)>, <22, (0, 12, 1)>, and <24, (2, 16, 19)>.
