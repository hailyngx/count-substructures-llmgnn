Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (3, 4) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 9, 4, 12
- Node 1: 2, 14, 13
- Node 2: 9, 7, 10, 11, 8, 1
- Node 3: 4, 14
- Node 4: 5, 7, 0, 11, 6, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 12, 11, 4, 7
- Node 6: 5, 4, 7, 12
- Node 7: 5, 4, 6, 2, 13
- Node 8: 2, 14
- Node 9: 5, 2, 0
- Node 10: 11, 13, 2, 14
- Node 11: 5, 4, 10, 2
- Node 12: 5, 6, 0
- Node 13: 7, 10, 1, 14
- Node 14: 10, 8, 3, 1, 13

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 64 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [64]. 
Some unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (9, 10, 11)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 12)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <13, (1, 10, 14)>
- <14, (1, 10, 13)>
