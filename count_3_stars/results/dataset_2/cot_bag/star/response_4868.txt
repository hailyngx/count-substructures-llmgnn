Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 

Response:
First of all, let's represent the given graph as a list of nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9, 13
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 13
- Node 2: 1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14
- Node 3: 11, 14
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 12
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8, 13
- Node 7: 2, 9, 11, 12
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 11, 14
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7, 10
- Node 10: 2, 9
- Node 11: 2, 3, 7, 8, 14
- Node 12: 4, 7, 13
- Node 13: 0, 1, 6, 12
- Node 14: 2, 8, 11, 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by considering each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

From the list of nodes and their neighbors, we have the following nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \) to each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives: \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 13)>
- <2, (7, 11, 14)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 7, 10)>
- <11, (2, 7, 14)>
- <12, (4, 7, 13)>
