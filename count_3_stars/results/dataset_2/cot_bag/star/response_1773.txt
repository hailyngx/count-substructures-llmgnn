Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 12) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 5) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 2) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 16) (9, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: <3, (1, 8, 13)> <3, (1, 15, 13)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (1, 7, 16)> <4, (1, 16, 13)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (1, 7, 19)> <5, (1, 7, 11)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (4, 17, 19)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: no 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: <11, (14, 5, 17)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: <12, (8, 14, 18)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: <13, (3, 16, 17)> <13, (3, 6, 17)>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: <14, (15, 10, 11)> <14, (15, 9, 11)> <14, (15, 9, 12)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (4, 13, 9)>
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (7, 11, 18)>
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: <18, (0, 12, 17)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: <19, (10, 5, 7)>

Adding all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
