Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look at each node with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they are part of. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star around node 0.  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 1.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 2.
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 3.
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star around node 4.
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 6.
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 4. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 7.
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 8.
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, and 2. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 9.
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 38 unique 3-stars. So, the answer is [38].
