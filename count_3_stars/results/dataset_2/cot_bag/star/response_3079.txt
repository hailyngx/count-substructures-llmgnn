Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 12) (18, 22) (18, 6) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 24) (23, 27) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 16) (26, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (11, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 25) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 20) (21, 10) (21, 9) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 6) (25, 17) (25, 11) (25, 0) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 5) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 15) (3, 17) (3, 20) (7, 23) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 27) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 3) (20, 9) (27, 23) (27, 29) (2, 26) (2, 19) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 0) (28, 17) (28, 5) (15, 24) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 28) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 15) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 19) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with only 1 neighbor and 17 nodes with 2 neighbors. We can ignore these nodes because they cannot form 3-stars. Let's focus on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

From the provided edges, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, 13, 22>, <1, 14, 19>, <4, 9, 20>, <8, 10, 29>, <11, 23, 25>, <12, 14, 6>, <15, 9, 24>, <16, 4, 26>, <17, 3, 28>, <20, 1, 10>, <22, 18, 6>, <23, 7, 27>, <25, 0, 11>, <26, 0, 2>
