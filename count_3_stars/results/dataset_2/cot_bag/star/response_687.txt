Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 13) (18, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 9) (9, 19) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with neighbors 8, 1, 12
- Node 1 with neighbors 15, 5, 0
- Node 2 with neighbors 14, 7, 11
- Node 4 with neighbors 12, 11, 6
- Node 5 with neighbors 18, 1, 17, 10, 14
- Node 6 with neighbors 4, 7, 10, 16
- Node 7 with neighbors 13, 2, 6
- Node 10 with neighbors 6, 5, 16, 14
- Node 12 with neighbors 17, 4, 0
- Node 14 with neighbors 2, 10, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
