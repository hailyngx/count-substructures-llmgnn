Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
1 --- 0 --- 2
|     |     |
7 --- 3 --- 8
      |     |
      5 --- 4
     / \
    9   6
```

In this graph, node 0 has 6 neighbors, node 3 has 6 neighbors, and node 8 has 4 neighbors. So we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes and sum them up. 

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
