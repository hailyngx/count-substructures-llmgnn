Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].
