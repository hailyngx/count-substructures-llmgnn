Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 1) (26, 5) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 12) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 7) (6, 25) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (25, 6) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 24) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 26) (12, 24) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 20) (16, 18) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 13) (15, 19) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 20) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 6) (29, 25) (1, 23) (1, 10) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 16) (14, 3) (17, 21) (17, 2) (20, 21) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 19) (22, 21) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, which potentially could form 3-stars. Let's go through each one:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
6. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
10. Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
11. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
14. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
15. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
17. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
18. Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [15].
