Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 29) (0, 24) (0, 11) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 11) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 12) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 7) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 4) (9, 22) (9, 11) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 9) (21, 3) (21, 18) (21, 2) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 8) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 27) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 13) (16, 6) (16, 25) (8, 26) (8, 29) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 19) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (17, 2) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 12) (4, 26) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 10) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 24) (27, 18) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 25) (10, 5) (10, 19) (12, 15) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 3, 6, 13, 15, and 26. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4+1+10+10+10 = 35 \), which we will denote as [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 14, 21)>
<3, (11, 14, 18)>
<3, (6, 15, 20)>
<3, (6, 16, 25)>
