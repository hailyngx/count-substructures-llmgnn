The edges are as follows: (9, 17) (9, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 16) (3, 14) (15, 27) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 17) (29, 2) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 23) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 21) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 7) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 28) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 4) (28, 24) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 22) (21, 18) (21, 14) (21, 24) (19, 24) (19, 16) (19, 23) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 28) (4, 5) (6, 11) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 16) (25, 22) (22, 7) (22, 25) (24, 28) (24, 21) (24, 19) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 0 has 3 neighbors (20, 23, 25), so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (20, 23, 25)>
Node 1: 1 has 3 neighbors (7, 20, 27), so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (7, 20, 27)>
Node 2: 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <2, (17, 18, 27)>, <2, (17, 18, 29)>, <2, (18, 21, 27)>, <2, (18, 21, 29)>
Node 7: 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 22), so it can form 1 3-star. <7, (1, 8, 22)>
Node 8: 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <8, (5, 18, 25)>, <8, (5, 7, 25)>, <8, (7, 18, 22)>, <8, (7, 18, 25)>
Node 10: 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <10, (11, 13, 20)>, <10, (11, 20, 26)>, <10, (13, 20, 26)>, <10, (11, 13, 26)>
Node 11: 11 has 3 neighbors (10, 17, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. <11, (10, 17, 6)>
Node 12: 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <12, (5, 14, 16)>, <12, (14, 16, 19)>, <12, (5, 14, 12)>, <12, (14, 16, 25)>
Node 13: 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <13, (10, 12, 26)>, <13, (12, 26, 28)>, <13, (10, 26, 28)>, <13, (12, 13, 28)>
Node 14: 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <14, (3, 12, 15)>, <14, (12, 15, 21)>, <14, (3, 15, 21)>, <14, (12, 15, 21)>
Node 16: 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <16, (12, 19, 25)>, <16, (19, 21, 24)>, <16, (12, 14, 16)>, <16, (14, 19, 25)>
Node 17: 17 has 3 neighbors (2, 9, 11), so it can form 1 3-star. <17, (2, 9, 11)>
Node 18: 18 has 3 neighbors (2, 21, 8), so it can form 1 3-star. <18, (2, 8, 21)>
Node 19: 19 has 3 neighbors (16, 23, 24), so it can form 1 3-star. <19, (16, 23, 24)>
Node 20: 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <20, (1, 10, 26)>, <20, (10, 26, 28)>, <20, (1, 26, 28)>, <20, (1, 10, 26)>
Node 25: 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <25, (0, 8, 22)>, <25, (8, 16, 19)>, <25, (0, 16, 19)>, <25, (0, 8, 16)>
Node 26: 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <26, (13, 20, 28)>, <26, (20, 28, 26)>, <26, (13, 28, 26)>, <26, (13, 20, 28)>
Node 27: 27 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 15), so it can form 1 3-star. <27, (1, 2, 15)>
Node 28: 28 has 3 neighbors (13, 24, 4), so it can form 1 3-star. <28, (13, 24, 4)>
Node 29: 29 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [(1+1+4+1+4+4+1+1+4+4+4+1+1+1+1+4+1+1+1+1)] = [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
