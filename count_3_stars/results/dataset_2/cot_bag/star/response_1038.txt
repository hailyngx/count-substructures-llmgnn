Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 8) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 13) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 25) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (24, 26) (24, 23) (24, 29) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 17) (17, 18) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 21) (10, 16) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 20) (23, 24) (23, 20) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 25) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 10) (0, 3) (0, 22) (19, 28) (19, 14) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 27) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 13) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (13, 18) (13, 27) (5, 25) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 26) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 24 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 21 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 27 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 77 \), so the final answer is \( [77] \).
