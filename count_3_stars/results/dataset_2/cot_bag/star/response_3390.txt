Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 9) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 28) (29, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 26) (5, 2) (5, 28) (11, 20) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 27) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 2) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 25) (18, 8) (18, 28) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 23) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 14) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 24) (0, 8) (0, 24) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 14) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 19) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 20, 21, 23, 27, and 28.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 20 has 6 neighbors: 21, 25, 13, 11, 12, and 24. So there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 20 as the center.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 20, 8, 24, 12, and 25. So there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 21 as the center.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 29, 11, 17, 27, and 24. So there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 23 as the center.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: 25, 23, 10, 26, and 19. So there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 27 as the center.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 29, 6, 18, 5, and 16. So there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 28 as the center.

Adding these up: \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, there are 60 total 3-stars in the given graph. Writing them out in the requested format:

\[ [\text{60}] \]

Unique 3-stars:
<20, (21, 13, 25)>
<21, (20, 12, 24)>
<23, (11, 17, 24)>
<27, (19, 25, 26)>
<28, (5, 18, 29)>
