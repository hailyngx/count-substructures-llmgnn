Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 13) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 16) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 14) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 14) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (3, 12) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Here is a list of nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 13, 15
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 10, 15
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 10, 12, 18
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 16
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 13, 14, 19
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 15, 17
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, 16
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 14, 9
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 13, 15, 19
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 10, 14
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 12, 17
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 5, 10, 16
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 11

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 13, 15)>
<4, (6, 10, 18)>
<6, (0, 2, 16)>
<10, (2, 4, 15)>
<13, (0, 8, 14)>
<14, (7, 8, 19)>
<16, (1, 6, 12)>
