Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 2, 4, 10), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (7, 8, 0, 12, 13), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9, 1, 11, 0, 14), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (7, 12, 0, 14, 6, 9), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7, 13, 12), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6, 2, 8), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (7, 2, 11, 12), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (1, 13, 0), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (3, 8, 13, 14), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9, 4, 8, 6, 2), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (2, 11, 10, 6), so there are 1 3-star formed.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 3, 0), so there are 1 3-star formed.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node gives a total of 12 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (7, 12, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 13)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (7, 2, 11)>
<11, (3, 8, 13)>
<12, (5, 9, 4)>
<13, (2, 11, 10)>
<14, (5, 4, 3)>
