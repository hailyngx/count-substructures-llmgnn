Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 27) (21, 10) (21, 16) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 29) (12, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 11) (27, 1) (27, 12) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 4) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (22, 0) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (13, 20) (13, 15) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 16) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 6) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 7) (16, 21) (16, 10) (16, 14) (11, 12) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 25) (2, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 7) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 19) (7, 24) (7, 14) (19, 10) (19, 20) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 26, 28, 27
- Node 8: neighbors 23, 14, 0, 12
- Node 12: neighbors 27, 17, 11, 8
- Node 26: neighbors 18, 10, 6, 1
- Node 10: neighbors 21, 26, 18, 19, 16
- Node 3: neighbors 28, 20, 6
- Node 6: neighbors 26, 3, 24
- Node 16: neighbors 21, 10, 14
- Node 5: neighbors 11, 4, 24
- Node 24: neighbors 5, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (26, 28, 27)> <8, (23, 14, 0)> <8, (23, 2, 29)> <8, (12, 27, 17)> <8, (12, 27, 11)> <12, (27, 17, 11)> <26, (18, 10, 6)> <26, (18, 10, 1)> <10, (21, 26, 18)> <10, (21, 26, 19)> <10, (21, 16, 14)> <10, (26, 18, 10)> <3, (28, 20, 6)> <5, (11, 4, 24)> <24, (5, 6, 7)>
