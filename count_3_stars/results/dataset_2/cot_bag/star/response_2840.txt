Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 14) (6, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 13) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 12) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 0 (degree 2), Node 1 (degree 3), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 3 (degree 2), Node 4 (degree 4), Node 5 (degree 4), Node 8 (degree 5), Node 9 (degree 5), Node 12 (degree 3), Node 13 (degree 4), Node 14 (degree 3), Node 15 (degree 4), Node 16 (degree 3), Node 17 (degree 2), Node 18 (degree 4), Node 19 (degree 2)  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (0, 16, 5)>  
<2, (17, 10, 4)>  
<4, (10, 5, 8)>  
<5, (4, 18, 1)>  
<8, (16, 15, 4)>  
<9, (11, 14, 13)>   
<12, (15, 9, 5)>  
<13, (1, 7, 9)>   
<14, (8, 6, 9)>  
<15, (3, 8, 12)>  
<18, (3, 8, 5)>
