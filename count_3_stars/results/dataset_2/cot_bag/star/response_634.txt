Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 24) (22, 16) (22, 5) (1, 29) (1, 28) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 12) (2, 21) (2, 24) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 24) (4, 28) (8, 25) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 15) (7, 23) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 0) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 9) (29, 5) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 3) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 5) (23, 20) (28, 1) (28, 14) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 27) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 23) (3, 17) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 12) (27, 9) (27, 6) (20, 9) (20, 23) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 0) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 2) (24, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 26.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30 \).

Hence, there are 30 total 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets, we have [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (18, 16, 25)>, <14, (17, 28, 29)>, <17, (6, 3, 12)>, <21, (2, 15, 12)>, <24, (10, 2, 4)>, <26, (11, 13, 3)>

So, the final answer is: [30], <0, (18, 16, 25)>, <14, (17, 28, 29)>, <17, (6, 3, 12)>, <21, (2, 15, 12)>, <24, (10, 2, 4)>, <26, (11, 13, 3)>
