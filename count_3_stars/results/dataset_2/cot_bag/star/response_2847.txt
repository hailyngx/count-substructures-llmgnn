Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0:  <0, (2, 3, 10)>, <0, (3, 5, 11)>
- Node 2:  <2, (0, 6, 14)>, <2, (4, 9, 11)>, <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- Node 3:  <3, (0, 5, 10)>, <3, (8, 10, 14)>
- Node 4:  <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 11)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5:  <5, (2, 3, 14)>
- Node 6:  <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 7:  <7, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 8:  <8, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 10: <10, (0, 6, 13)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 10, 8)>
- Node 13: <13, (5, 10, 1)>, <13, (6, 10, 1)>

Adding these up, we get a total of [21] 3-stars in the graph.
