Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The node degrees in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with degree 4 and above:
  - Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 5 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
  - Node 6 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 7 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
  - Node 8 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 3-stars in the graph, which we'll represent within brackets: [44].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
