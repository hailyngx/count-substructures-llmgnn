Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
Node 1  
Node 2  
Node 4  
Node 5  
Node 7  
Node 8  
Node 9  
Node 12  
Node 13  
Node 14  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{1} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{1} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{1} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all these nodes gives us a total of [44].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
