Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 29) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 1) (21, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 29) (17, 23) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 0) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 4) (9, 22) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 7) (20, 11) (20, 3) (20, 18) (25, 12) (25, 24) (14, 26) (14, 24) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 8) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 1) (24, 25) (24, 14) (0, 6) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 0) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 23) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 27) (10, 2) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 13) (23, 6) (23, 17) (23, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors. 
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors. 
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Now we can count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula mentioned earlier:

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, each contributes 1 3-star:
- Nodes 11, 13, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 each contribute 1 3-star.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for each:
- Node 1 contributes 4 3-stars: <1, (11, 24, 21)>, <1, (11, 24, 13)>, <1, (11, 24, 1)>, <1, (11, 24, 14)>.
- Node 4 contributes 4 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 22)>, <4, (5, 22, 26)>, <4, (5, 22, 27)>, <4, (5, 26, 27)>.
- Node 6 contributes 4 3-stars: <6, (5, 0, 23)>, <6, (5, 10, 2)>, <6, (5, 10, 27)>, <6, (5, 2, 10)>.
- Node 10 contributes 4 3-stars: <10, (16, 5, 27)>, <10, (16, 5, 2)>, <10, (16, 5, 6)>, <10, (16, 6, 23)>.
- Node 12 contributes 4 3-stars: <12, (16, 25, 3)>, <12, (16, 25, 8)>, <12, (16, 3, 0)>, <12, (16, 3, 12)>.
- Node 16 contributes 4 3-stars: <16, (12, 29, 28)>, <16, (12, 29, 17)>, <16, (12, 29, 16)>, <16, (12, 29, 16)>.
- Node 18 contributes 4 3-stars: <18, (20, 0, 13)>, <18, (20, 0, 15)>, <18, (20, 0, 18)>, <18, (20, 15, 13)>.
- Node 24 contributes 4 3-stars: <24, (11, 1, 25)>, <24, (11, 1, 14)>, <24, (11, 1, 24)>, <24, (11, 1, 25)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get:
\[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [41] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 41.
