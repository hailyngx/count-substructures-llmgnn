Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions, we have a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 17)>, <2, (3, 6, 12)>, <3, (1, 2, 18)>, <5, (13, 14, 19)>, <10, (7, 9, 19)>, <11, (9, 16, 17)>, <16, (6, 11, 17)>, <17, (11, 12, 16)>
