Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (27, 5) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 0) (10, 23) (17, 28) (17, 19) (17, 15) (26, 1) (26, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (22, 2) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 29) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 28) (8, 29) (8, 16) (9, 7) (9, 19) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 23) (24, 20) (24, 25) (5, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 23) (28, 17) (28, 15) (28, 12) (20, 24) (20, 23) (4, 15) (4, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 18) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 6) (25, 18) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 12) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 25) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 2) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 6) (23, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 46.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 10, 14>
- <1, 3, 13>
- <3, 11, 18>
- <12, 21, 28>
- <15, 17, 19>
- <16, 19, 23>
- <25, 18, 29>.
