Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (6, 2, 7), forming 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 2, 7)>.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 2, 5), forming 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
    <1, (9, 3, 2)>, 
    <1, (9, 2, 5)>, 
    <1, (9, 3, 5)>, 
    <1, (3, 2, 5)>.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 4, 7), forming 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 
    <2, (9, 1, 4)>, 
    <2, (9, 1, 7)>, 
    <2, (9, 4, 7)>, 
    <2, (1, 4, 7)>.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (6, 1, 7, 5), forming 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center: 
    <3, (6, 1, 7)>, 
    <3, (6, 1, 5)>, 
    <3, (6, 5, 7)>, 
    <3, (1, 5, 7)>.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 5, 2), forming 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 
    <4, (9, 3, 5)>, 
    <4, (9, 3, 2)>, 
    <4, (9, 5, 2)>, 
    <4, (3, 5, 2)>.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 4), forming 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center: 
    <5, (6, 1, 3)>, 
    <5, (6, 1, 4)>, 
    <5, (6, 3, 4)>, 
    <5, (1, 3, 4)>.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 5, 3, 0), forming 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
    <6, (9, 5, 3)>, 
    <6, (9, 5, 0)>, 
    <6, (9, 3, 0)>, 
    <6, (5, 3, 0)>.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 2, 8, 0), forming 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center: (notice 10 = inom{5}{3})
    <7, (1, 3, 2)>, 
    <7, (1, 3, 8)>, 
    <7, (1, 2, 8)>, 
    <7, (3, 2, 8)>, 
    <7, (1, 2, 0)>, 
    <7, (1, 3, 0)>, 
    <7, (2, 8, 0)>, 
    <7, (3, 8, 0)>, 
    <7, (2, 0, 8)>, 
    <7, (3, 0, 8)>.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (6, 4, 2, 1), forming 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 
    <9, (6, 4, 2)>, 
    <9, (6, 4, 1)>, 
    <9, (6, 2, 1)>, 
    <9, (4, 2, 1)>.

Counting all these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [35].
