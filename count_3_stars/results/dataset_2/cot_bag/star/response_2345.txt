Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. This total number is written inside brackets as [44].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 1, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
