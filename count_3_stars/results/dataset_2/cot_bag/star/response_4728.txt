Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

We need to calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [86] 3-stars. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<14, (7, 5, 13)>
<13, (0, 10, 10)>
