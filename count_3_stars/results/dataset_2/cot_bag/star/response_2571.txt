Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The degrees of the nodes are: 
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11}

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 78

So, the total number of 3-stars is [78].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 13, 4)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 13, 4)>
<0, (8, 14, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<1, (3, 12, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 11, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 11, 7)>
<2, (9, 10, 12)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 11)>
<4, (13, 11, 7)>
<5, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (6, 3, 1)>
<5, (7, 11, 14)>
<9, (10, 12, 3)>
<11, (13, 4, 0)>
