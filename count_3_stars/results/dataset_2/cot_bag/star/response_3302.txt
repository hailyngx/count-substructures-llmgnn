Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 14) (18, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 19) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 9) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 6) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (11, 1), (7, 1), (1, 9), (1, 12)
    - [] 

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 14)
    - [] 

3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (19, 3), (3, 9), (3, 6)
    - [] 

4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (4, 5), (7, 5), (5, 17), (5, 10)
    - [] 

5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 19), (0, 6), (3, 6), (6, 14)
    - [] 

6. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 12), (9, 15), (9, 3)
    - [] 

7. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (10, 19), (10, 5), (2, 10)
    - [] 

8. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (11, 16), (11, 1), (15, 11)
    - [] 

9. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (13, 12), (12, 1), (9, 12)
    - [] 

10. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 13), (14, 2), (14, 18), (6, 14)
    - [] 

11. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (15, 11), (18, 15), (15, 17), (15, 9)
    - [] 

12. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (11, 16), (16, 7), (0, 16)
    - [] 

13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (19, 5), (19, 10), (19, 3), (6, 19)
    - [] 

14. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (16, 0), (8, 0), (0, 6)
    - [] 

15. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: (4, 5), (5, 4)
    - [] 

16. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (7, 16), (7, 1)
    - [] 

17. Node 8 has 1 neighbor: (8, 0)
    - [] 

18. Node 13 has 2 neighbors: (13, 12), (13, 14)
    - [] 

19. Node 17 has 2 neighbors: (17, 5), (15, 17)
    - [] 

20. Node 18 has 2 neighbors: (18, 14), (18, 15)
    - [] 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [].

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph is <>.
