Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 13, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (6, 11, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 11)>
<8, (2, 4, 12)>
<9, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (3, 7, 12)>
<11, (5, 7, 14)>
<12, (8, 10, 14)>
<13, (0, 3, 9)>
<14, (10, 11, 12)>
