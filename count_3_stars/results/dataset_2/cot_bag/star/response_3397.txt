Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 96 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [96]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 10, 11)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<3, (2, 7, 11)>
<5, (0, 1, 12)>
<6, (7, 13, 14)>
<8, (4, 11, 12)>
<9, (0, 12, 14)>
<11, (0, 5, 8)>
<12, (2, 5, 10)>
<14, (4, 6, 9)>
