Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees greater than or equal to 3 are: 5, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes as central nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (10, 13, 19)>, <5, (10, 13, 5)>, <5, (10, 19, 16)>, <5, (13, 19, 5)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <7, (17, 13, 16)>, <7, (17, 16, 1)>, <7, (13, 16, 7)>, <7, (13, 19, 7)>, <7, (16, 6, 7)>, <7, (16, 1, 7)>, <7, (13, 7, 17)>, <7, (16, 7, 6)>, <7, (16, 7, 1)>, <7, (6, 7, 16)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <12, (2, 18, 19)>, <12, (2, 18, 12)>, <12, (18, 8, 12)>, <12, (18, 1, 12)>, <12, (18, 12, 9)>, <12, (2, 12, 19)>, <12, (8, 12, 19)>, <12, (1, 12, 18)>, <12, (1, 12, 7)>, <12, (9, 12, 18)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <13, (11, 5, 7)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <16, (5, 0, 16)>, <16, (5, 7, 16)>, <16, (0, 1, 16)>, <16, (0, 6, 16)>, <16, (0, 16, 5)>, <16, (7, 6, 16)>, <16, (7, 1, 16)>, <16, (7, 16, 5)>, <16, (6, 7, 16)>, <16, (1, 14, 16)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <17, (10, 7, 13)>, <17, (10, 16, 7)>, <17, (10, 17, 19)>, <17, (10, 17, 9)>, <17, (7, 13, 17)>, <17, (16, 7, 17)>, <17, (16, 1, 17)>, <17, (19, 5, 17)>, <17, (19, 12, 17)>, <17, (9, 17, 19)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <19, (15, 17, 5)>, <19, (15, 12, 19)>, <19, (0, 15, 19)>, <19, (0, 16, 19)>, <19, (17, 7, 19)>, <19, (17, 9, 19)>, <19, (5, 10, 19)>, <19, (5, 13, 19)>, <19, (12, 18, 19)>, <19, (12, 9, 19)>

Total number of 3-stars: [45]
Unique 3-stars found: <5, (10, 13, 19)>, <7, (17, 13, 16)>, <12, (2, 18, 19)>, <13, (11, 5, 7)>, <16, (5, 0, 16)>, <17, (10, 7, 13)>, <19, (15, 17, 5)>
