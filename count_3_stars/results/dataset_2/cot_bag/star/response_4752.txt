Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 5, 6, 9, 4, 8, and 2 have at least 3 neighbors, so we will focus on these nodes.

Let's start by counting the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 5: 
  - Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 8, 7.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars with node 5: 
    - <5, (9, 6, 2)>
    - <5, (9, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (9, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (9, 2, 8)>
    - <5, (9, 2, 7)>
    - <5, (9, 8, 7)>
    - <5, (6, 2, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 2, 7)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 7)>
    - <5, (2, 8, 7)>

- For node 9: 
  - Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 4.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars with node 9: 
    - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (5, 6, 4)>
    - <9, (5, 8, 4)>
    - <9, (6, 8, 4)>

- For nodes 6, 4, 8, and 2: 
  - Similarly, we can calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes, but since the calculation is repetitive, we will just provide the final results:
  - Node 6: 10 3-stars
  - Node 4: 4 3-stars
  - Node 8: 20 3-stars
  - Node 2: 10 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars for each of these nodes: 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 54
There's a total of 54 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [54]
