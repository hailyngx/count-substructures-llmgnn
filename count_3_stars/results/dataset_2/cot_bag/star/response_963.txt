Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 22) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 16) (29, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 26) (26, 29) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 21) (16, 22) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 11) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 4) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (9, 3) (9, 20) (25, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 28) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 24) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 20) (12, 28) (6, 4) (7, 18) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 7) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 24) (24, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
From the provided list of edges, we can determine the degrees of each node:

1. Node 1: Degree 2
2. Node 2: Degree 2
3. Node 3: Degree 4
4. Node 4: Degree 6
5. Node 5: Degree 4
6. Node 6: Degree 1
7. Node 7: Degree 1
8. Node 8: Degree 2
9. Node 9: Degree 3
10. Node 10: Degree 4
11. Node 11: Degree 2
12. Node 12: Degree 3
13. Node 13: Degree 3
14. Node 14: Degree 2
15. Node 15: Degree 4
16. Node 16: Degree 4
17. Node 17: Degree 4
18. Node 18: Degree 5
19. Node 19: Degree 4
20. Node 20: Degree 4
21. Node 21: Degree 3
22. Node 22: Degree 3
23. Node 23: Degree 3
24. Node 24: Degree 5
25. Node 25: Degree 1
26. Node 26: Degree 4
27. Node 27: Degree 4
28. Node 28: Degree 4
29. Node 29: Degree 4

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars related to nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4+20+4+1+4+4+10+4+4+1+10+10+10 = 82 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82]. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
    <3, (2, 19, 26)>
    <4, (6, 10, 24)>
    <9, (3, 20, 26)>
    <10, (3, 18, 4)>
    <12, (20, 24, 28)>
    <16, (17, 21, 22)>
    <18, (7, 10, 15)>
    <18, (7, 11, 21)>
    <18, (10, 15, 4)>
    <18, (15, 10, 18)>
    <18, (15, 11, 21)>
    <20, (15, 19, 4)>
    <21, (5, 11, 16)>
    <23, (0, 13, 26)>
    <24, (4, 22, 25)>
    <24, (4, 22, 28)>
    <24, (6, 10, 4)>
    <24, (10, 4, 24)>
    <25, (22, 24, 28)>
    <26, (19, 21, 23)>
    <28, (0, 22, 24)>
    <29, (17, 26, 27)>
