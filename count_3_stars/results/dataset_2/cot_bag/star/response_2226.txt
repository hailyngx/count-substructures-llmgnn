Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 20) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 2) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 22) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 29) (10, 27) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 27) (18, 29) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 15) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 14) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 23) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 23) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 0) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (24, 1) (24, 20) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 4) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (14, 15) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 12) (27, 10) (27, 18) (12, 3) (12, 25) (4, 11) (4, 15) 

Response:
There are two nodes with exactly three neighbors: node 11 and node 18.

For node 11, there are 5 possible 3-star combinations:
1. <11, (16, 4, 2)>
2. <11, (16, 25, 20)>
3. <11, (4, 16, 25)>
4. <11, (2, 16, 21)>
5. <11, (20, 16, 7)>

For node 18, there are 10 possible 3-star combinations:
1. <18, (17, 2, 29)>
2. <18, (17, 2, 5)>
3. <18, (17, 5, 18)>
4. <18, (17, 5, 29)>
5. <18, (17, 18, 27)>
6. <18, (2, 17, 29)>
7. <18, (2, 17, 19)>
8. <18, (2, 19, 5)>
9. <18, (2, 19, 29)>
10. <18, (27, 17, 18)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [5 + 10] = 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 15.
