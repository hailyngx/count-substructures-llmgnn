Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given list of edges, here are the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 1, 8
- Node 1: 9, 4, 3, 2, 0
- Node 2: 9, 7, 1, 3, 6
- Node 4: 7, 8, 1, 6
- Node 6: 4, 8, 2
- Node 8: 9, 4, 3, 0, 6
- Node 9: 5, 0, 8, 2, 1, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 9, 1)>
- <1, (9, 4, 3)>
- <2, (9, 7, 3)>
- <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- <6, (4, 8, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
