Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
The graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12) 
(1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 14) 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 13) 
(3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 2) 
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 11) 
(5, 2) 
(6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 10) 
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 10), (7, 14) 
(8, 9), (8, 13) 
(9, 8), (9, 14) 
(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 6), (10, 7), (10, 13) 
(11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 14) 
(12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 14) 
(13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 1), (13, 11) 
(14, 7), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 11), (14, 12) 

Now, let's find the 3-star structures in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 10, 11)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 10, 13)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 11, 13)>
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 11)>
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (0, 1, 13)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (0, 2, 14)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (2, 3, 10)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (7, 9, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
