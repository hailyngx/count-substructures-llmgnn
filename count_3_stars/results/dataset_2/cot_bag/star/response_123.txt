Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: 1, 3, 11, 14, 13, 4, 0, 10, 7, 2, 6, 5, 12, 8, 9
Edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 14, 13, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 14, 6, and 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 6, and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 10, 8, 0, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 2.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 9, and 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 4, 5, and 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 12, 0, and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 14, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 14.

Next, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 62 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [62].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 13, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 11)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 7, 14)>, <10, (9, 14, 7)>, <11, (1, 6, 13)>, <14, (1, 9, 0)>, <14, (3, 9, 0)>.
