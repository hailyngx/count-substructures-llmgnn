Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 10)>, <0, (5, 3, 9)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (6, 2, 10)>, <0, (0, 2, 7)>, <0, (0, 2, 10)>, <0, (0, 7, 10)>, <0, (0, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<1, (14, 7, 9)>, <1, (14, 9, 11)>, <1, (14, 9, 4)>, <1, (14, 9, 1)>, <1, (14, 11, 13)>, <1, (14, 11, 12)>, <1, (14, 11, 9)>, <1, (14, 13, 3)>, <1, (14, 13, 4)>, <1, (14, 3, 2)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<4, (14, 2, 9)>, <4, (14, 1, 9)>, <4, (14, 1, 4)>, <4, (14, 1, 13)>, <4, (14, 2, 3)>, <4, (14, 3, 9)>, <4, (14, 3, 13)>, <4, (14, 9, 3)>, <4, (14, 9, 13)>, <4, (14, 1, 13)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<7, (0, 1, 10)>, <7, (0, 1, 14)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 10, 11)>, <7, (0, 10, 12)>, <7, (0, 10, 7)>, <7, (0, 0, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 13)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<9, (14, 1, 11)>, <9, (14, 1, 1)>, <9, (14, 1, 4)>, <9, (14, 1, 9)>, <9, (14, 1, 3)>, <9, (14, 4, 7)>, <9, (14, 4, 9)>, <9, (14, 4, 3)>, <9, (14, 9, 1)>, <9, (14, 9, 3)>

Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
<11, (10, 7, 12)>, <11, (10, 7, 13)>, <11, (10, 12, 13)>, <11, (10, 12, 11)>, <11, (10, 12, 9)>, <11, (10, 11, 13)>, <11, (10, 11, 9)>, <11, (10, 13, 3)>, <11, (10, 13, 4)>, <11, (10, 3, 9)>

Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<13, (3, 4, 9)>, <13, (3, 4, 11)>, <13, (3, 9, 1)>, <13, (3, 9, 11)>, <13, (3, 1, 2)>, <13, (3, 1, 4)>, <13, (3, 2, 4)>, <13, (3, 2, 9)>, <13, (3, 2, 11)>, <13, (4, 2, 9)>, <13, (4, 2, 11)>, <13, (4, 9, 1)>, <13, (4, 9, 11)>, <13, (4, 1, 11)>, <13, (4, 1, 3)>, <13, (4, 11, 12)>, <13, (4, 11, 13)>, <13, (4, 3, 1)>, <13, (4, 3, 12)>, <13, (4, 3, 11)>

Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 80 \).

So, the final answer is [80].
