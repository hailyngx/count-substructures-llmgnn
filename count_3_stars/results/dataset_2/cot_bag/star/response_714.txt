Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph based on the given information:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing them up, we get a total of 49 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>.
