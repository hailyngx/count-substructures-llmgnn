Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars with node 1.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 10, 13
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars with node 3.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 11, 14
- There is only 1 possible 3-star with node 4.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 10, 12, 14, 0
- There is only 1 possible 3-star with node 6.

For node 10:
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 13
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars with node 10.

For node 11:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 9
- There is only 1 possible 3-star with node 11.

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6
- There is no 3-star with node 12.

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 7, 9, 10, 13, 14
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars with node 13.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 13
- There is only 1 possible 3-star with node 14.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 1] = [63] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
