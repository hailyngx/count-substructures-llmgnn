Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [63].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
