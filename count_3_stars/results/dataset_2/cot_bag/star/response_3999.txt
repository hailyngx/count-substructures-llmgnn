Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 2) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 19) (0, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 9) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 13) (6, 29) (6, 22) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 12) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 24) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 14) (21, 11) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 27) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 19) (13, 20) (13, 5) (13, 29) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 25) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 18) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 15) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 20) (27, 21) (27, 9) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 27) (9, 24) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 24) (22, 6) (15, 4) (15, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (17)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (25, 16, 28, 18)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (4, 11, 16, 24)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (4, 7, 10, 21, 14)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (7, 12, 15, 3, 2, 15)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (7, 23, 13, 13)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (29, 22)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (4, 3, 5)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (23, 16, 23)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (20, 28, 27, 24)
- Node 10: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (14, 21, 2)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (4, 26, 25)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (20, 5, 29)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (11, 3)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (4, 25)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (8, 1, 21, 2)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (0, 19)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (1, 26, 19)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (23, 17, 28, 18)
- Node 20: 3 neighbors (13, 27, 9)
- Node 21: 4 neighbors (11, 3, 16, 27)
- Node 22: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (8, 5, 19)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (9, 28, 2)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (1, 12, 15)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (28, 18, 12)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (20, 21, 9)
- Node 28: 5 neighbors (1, 26, 9, 19, 24)
- Node 29: 2 neighbors (6, 13)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 1, 4, 19, and 28 have 4 or more neighbors, making inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 2, 3, 5, 9, 16, 21, and 26 have 3 neighbors, making 1 3-star each.

So the total number of 3-stars is [4*4 + 7*1] = [16 + 7] = [23].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (25, 16, 18)>
<4, (12, 15, 25)>
<4, (12, 25, 26)>
<4, (15, 25, 12)>
<4, (15, 25, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 23)>
<8, (16, 23, 24)>
<9, (27, 19, 28)>
<9, (27, 20, 28)>
<9, (27, 28, 19)>
<16, (21, 2, 8)>
<19, (18, 26, 28)>
<19, (18, 26, 19)>
<19, (18, 26, 12)>
<19, (18, 1, 28)>
<19, (18, 1, 26)>
<19, (18, 28, 1)>
<28, (9, 24, 2)>
