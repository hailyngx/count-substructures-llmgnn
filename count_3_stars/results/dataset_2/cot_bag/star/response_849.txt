Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 78

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [78].
