Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The central node and its neighbors in this graph are as follows:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 15 3-stars
- Node 2: 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 15 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 3-stars
- Node 9: 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [59]
