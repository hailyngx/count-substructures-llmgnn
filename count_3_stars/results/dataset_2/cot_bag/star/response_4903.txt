Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 4) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 27) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 5) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 14) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 18) (5, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 17) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 10) (18, 7) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 21) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 15) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 11) (15, 8) (15, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (14, 1) (14, 28) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 27) (4, 25) (4, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 9, 26, 3, 25, 22, 23, 20, 1, 7, 12, 2, 8, 28, 5, 19, 27, 18, 11, 17, 29, 21, and 15. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \).  

- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \(10+4+10+4+4+1+4+1+1+1+4+1+1+0+1+4+4+1+1+1+1+0 = 52\). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
The unique 3-stars found are:
