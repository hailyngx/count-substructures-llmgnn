Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}

Now, let's determine the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors. Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 44 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<0, (7, 5, 1)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 7, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (3, 7, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (7, 0, 1)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<8, (9, 2, 0)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>
Note: The order of the nodes in the 3-star doesn't matter, so <1, (6, 9, 3)> is the same 3-star as <1, (3, 9, 6)>.
