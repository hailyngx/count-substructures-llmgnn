Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 15) (8, 1) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 24) (28, 25) (28, 21) (28, 13) (22, 14) (22, 29) (26, 17) (26, 21) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 4) (5, 25) (5, 16) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 10) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 11) (19, 21) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 29) (27, 10) (27, 29) (29, 22) (29, 19) (29, 27) (29, 18) (24, 17) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 4) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 4) (18, 15) (18, 29) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 6: neighbors {11, 12, 13} forming a 3-star.
- Node 3: neighbors {25, 7, 0} forming a 3-star.
- Node 25: neighbors {3, 5, 28} forming a 3-star.
- Node 14: neighbors {17, 22} but only forms 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 17: neighbors {14, 1, 24} forming a 3-star.
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 10, 23} forming a 3-star.
- Node 11: neighbors {6, 25, 20} forming a 3-star.
- Node 15: neighbors {2, 7, 19, 18, 11} forming 1 3-star.
- Node 19: neighbors {21, 10, 15, 29} forming a 3-star.
- Node 29: neighbors {22, 19, 27, 18} forming a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (11, 12, 13)>, <3, (25, 7, 0)>, <25, (3, 5, 28)>, <17, (14, 1, 24)>, <0, (3, 10, 23)>, <11, (6, 25, 20)>, <19, (21, 10, 15)>
