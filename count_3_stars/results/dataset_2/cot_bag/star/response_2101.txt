Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 8}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0, 1, and 3 don't have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

Adding the total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 4 + 10] = 34 \)
