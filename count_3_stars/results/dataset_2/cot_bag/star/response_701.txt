Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars is [51], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>
