Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- 0: {7, 8, 13}
- 1: {8, 9, 10}
- 2: {4, 9, 12}
- 3: {4, 6, 8, 11}
- 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
- 5: {4, 6, 9, 13}
- 6: {3, 5, 8, 14}
- 7: {0, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
- 8: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 12, 14}
- 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- 10: {1, 7}
- 11: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- 12: {2, 7, 8, 14}
- 13: {0, 5}
- 14: {6, 8, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
   - <4, (2, 7, 11)>
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
   - <7, (0, 9, 11)>
   - <7, (0, 9, 12)>
   - <7, (0, 10, 1)>
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 6, 14)>
   - <8, (1, 10, 7)>
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
   - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
   - <12, (2, 7, 14)>
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
   - <14, (6, 8, 12)>

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [75].
