Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can construct the 3-star graph as follows:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 10, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 10, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 13, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 4, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 12.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 11, 8, and 2.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 8, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 13, 14, and 12.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Unique 3-star configurations found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 12)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (6, 3, 13)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<7, (5, 1, 4)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<11, (14, 13, 12)>
<4, (3, 7, 14)>
<14, (11, 4, 2)>
<12, (9, 11, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 13)>
