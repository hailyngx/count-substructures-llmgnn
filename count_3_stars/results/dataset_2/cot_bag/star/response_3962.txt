Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 6) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (18, 0) (5, 17) (5, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 10, 17, 4, 8, 15, 7, 16, 3, 13, 19, 9, and 12. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (17, 12, 13)>, <10, (17, 12, 15)>, <10, (17, 13, 15)>, <17, (10, 12, 13)>, <17, (10, 12, 15)>, <17, (10, 13, 15)>, <7, (17, 9, 16)>, <7, (17, 16, 5)>, <7, (17, 16, 13)>, <7, (17, 5, 16)>, <7, (9, 13, 14)>, <13, (10, 6, 16)>, <13, (10, 12, 14)>, <13, (10, 14, 19)>, <13, (6, 14, 16)>, <13, (6, 16, 5)>, <13, (14, 16, 19)>, <13, (14, 19, 12)>, <13, (16, 5, 14)>
