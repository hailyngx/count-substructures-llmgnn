Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 14) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 19) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors (degree 3 or higher) are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the 3-star counts: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 1, 17)>
<1, (0, 15, 7)>
<2, (11, 10, 0)>
<4, (16, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<9, (4, 3, 7)>
<13, (11, 17, 3)>
<14, (5, 15, 19)>
<16, (12, 18, 4)>
<17, (0, 8, 13)>
<18, (7, 1, 19)>
