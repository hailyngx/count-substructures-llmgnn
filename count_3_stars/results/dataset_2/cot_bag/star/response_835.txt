Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 11, 0, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 1, 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 10, 2, 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 3, 7
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 14, 7
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 0, 3, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 11, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 13, 7, 2, 1
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 4, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 12, 3
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 4, 2, 14

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars and calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 10, 11, 8, 13, 7, 12, 0, 1, 2, 14, 3

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 82 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (8, 12, 11)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <6, (9, 14, 10)>, <10, (6, 0, 7)>, <11, (5, 6, 14)>, <8, (5, 13, 0)>, <7, (5, 10, 11)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>, <0, (5, 10, 8)>, <1, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 12)>, <14, (6, 11, 3)>, <3, (10, 8, 4)>
