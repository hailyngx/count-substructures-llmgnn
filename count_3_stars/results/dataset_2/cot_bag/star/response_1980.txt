Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 23) (26, 18) (26, 5) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 5) (1, 22) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 21) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 21) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 28) (29, 7) (2, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 12) (21, 18) (21, 17) (16, 22) (10, 18) (10, 20) (23, 13) (23, 9) (23, 2) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 14) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 15) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 20) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 25) (15, 22) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (11, 8) (11, 20) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 15) (20, 4) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 11) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, so let's find the 3-stars formed around those nodes.

1. Node 0: 
    - Neighbors: 27, 3, 8, 1
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (27, 3, 8)>, <0, (27, 3, 1)>, <0, (27, 8, 1)>, <0, (3, 8, 1)>
    
2. Node 5: 
    - Neighbors: 26, 27, 1, 17
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (26, 27, 1)>, <5, (26, 27, 17)>, <5, (26, 1, 17)>, <5, (27, 1, 17)>

3. Node 7: 
    - Neighbors: 8, 29, 19, 28
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (8, 29, 19)>, <7, (8, 29, 28)>, <7, (8, 19, 28)>, <7, (29, 19, 28)>

4. Node 14: 
    - Neighbors: 13, 27, 25, 24, 15
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <14, (13, 27, 25)>, <14, (13, 27, 24)>, <14, (13, 27, 15)>, <14, (13, 25, 24)>, <14, (13, 25, 15)>, <14, (13, 24, 15)>, <14, (27, 25, 24)>, <14, (27, 25, 15)>, <14, (27, 24, 15)>, <14, (25, 24, 15)>
 
Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 22\) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 22.
