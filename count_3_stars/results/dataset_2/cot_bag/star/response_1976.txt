Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), 
(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), 
(4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), 
(7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8), 
(6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), 
(1, 5), (1, 3), 
(3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), 
(8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 2), 
(2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), 
(0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 4, 9)>
7. <7, (0, 4, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 5, 7)>
