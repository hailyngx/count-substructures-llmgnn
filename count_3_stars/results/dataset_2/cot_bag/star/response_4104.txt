Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 15) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 19) (12, 4) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 19) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Thus, there are 46 total 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars:
