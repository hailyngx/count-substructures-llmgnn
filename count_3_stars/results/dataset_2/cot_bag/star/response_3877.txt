Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 3) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (8, 18) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 18) (9, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \)

So, there are a total of 47 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [47] 

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 5, 18)>, <2, (1, 6, 13)>, <3, (4, 10, 15)>, <5, (1, 3, 12)>, <11, (16, 12, 17)>, <12, (11, 5, 13)>, <13, (7, 6, 19)>, <14, (17, 7, 15)>, <15, (16, 7, 18)>, <16, (11, 1, 15)>, <17, (11, 14, 3)>, <18, (8, 19, 15)>, <19, (5, 13, 18)>.
