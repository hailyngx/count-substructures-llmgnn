Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 23 \)

So, there are a total of 23 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets: \[23\]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, 7, 10, 19>
- <6, 1, 3, 12>
- <10, 0, 13, 19>
- <12, 3, 5, 6>
