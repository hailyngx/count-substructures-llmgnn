Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees higher than or equal to 3 are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 61 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 61 3-stars in this graph. 

The list of unique 3-stars found inside <> is: <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 10, 13)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (9, 11, 12)>, <5, (1, 5, 11)>, <5, (4, 7, 14)>, <6, (0, 2, 13)>, <7, (3, 13, 14)>, <9, (0, 5, 12)>, <10, (3, 11, 13)>.
Thus, the final answer is [61].
