Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 5>
<3, 0, 2>
<3, 8, 6>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 8, 6>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 6, 7>
