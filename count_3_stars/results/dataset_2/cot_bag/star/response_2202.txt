Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19.  
Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 total 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

<5, 1, 3>  
<6, 5, 8>  
<10, 19, 5>  
<12, 2, 14>  
<13, 7, 15>  
<14, 6, 8>  
<15, 12, 13>  
<16, 2, 3>  
<19, 10, 15>  

The final count of the unique 3-stars is [9].
