Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 15) (17, 18) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 19) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 10) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 16) (10, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 8) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 16
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 14
- Node 3: 1, 6, 11, 13
- Node 4: 6, 19
- Node 5: 2, 12, 14, 19
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 15
- Node 7: 1, 9, 14
- Node 8: 10, 16, 18
- Node 9: 7
- Node 10: 8, 16
- Node 11: 3, 12, 15, 18, 19
- Node 12: 5, 11
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 2, 5, 7, 15, 18
- Node 15: 6, 11, 14
- Node 16: 0, 8, 10, 19
- Node 17: 18
- Node 18: 8, 11, 14, 17
- Node 19: 4, 5, 11, 16

We can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 11, 13), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (2, 12, 14, 19), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 15), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 9, 14), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (10, 16, 18), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors (3, 12, 15, 18, 19), contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 15, 18), contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (0, 8, 10, 19), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (8, 11, 14, 17), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (4, 11, 16, 5), contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47]. 
Some unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 11)>, <5, (2, 14, 19)>, <6, (2, 3, 15)>, <7, (1, 9, 14)>, <8, (10, 16, 18)>, <11, (3, 12, 15)>, <14, (2, 5, 18)>, <16, (0, 10, 19)>, <18, (8, 11, 14)>
