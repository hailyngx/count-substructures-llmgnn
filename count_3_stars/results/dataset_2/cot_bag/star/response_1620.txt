Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 26) (14, 9) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 29) (10, 21) (10, 3) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 3) (25, 9) (25, 19) (27, 21) (27, 24) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 24) (11, 1) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 20) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 25) (9, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 9) (19, 29) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 26) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 20) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 5) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 13) (23, 28) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 7, 21, 4, 8, 12, 0, 14, 28, 2, and 1.
Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, 12, 22>
<21, 10, 27>
<4, 0, 26>
<4, 1, 2>
<8, 2, 5>
<12, 7, 22>
<0, 4, 26>
<14, 9, 13>
<28, 16, 23>
<1, 11, 17>
