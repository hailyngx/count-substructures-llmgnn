Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7
- Node 1: 5, 4, 7, 2
- Node 2: 7, 1, 3
- Node 3: 5, 6, 2
- Node 4: 9, 6, 7, 1, 8
- Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: 5, 7, 4, 3, 8
- Node 7: 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 4, 7
- Node 9: 5, 4, 0

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <2, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (9, 4, 1)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <6, (7, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>
