Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.

Adding up all these contributions, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 18, 19)>
<1, (6, 15, 0)>
<2, (0, 18, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<7, (4, 19, 12)>
<9, (11, 7, 12)>
<13, (3, 14, 16)>
<14, (10, 13, 18)>
<16, (13, 5, 2)>
<18, (14, 2, 3)>
<19, (0, 7, 8)>
