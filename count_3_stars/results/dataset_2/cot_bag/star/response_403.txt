Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 78 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 78. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 14)>, <4, (0, 10, 8)>, <5, (6, 12, 3)>, <7, (10, 8, 12)>
