Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph described:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 9, 13
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 9, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 0, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 3, 9, 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 4, 2, 5, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 2, 0, 14, 1
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 1
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 8, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 7, 14, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 6, 14, 1
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 12, 2, 9, 13

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

There are a total of [11] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 9, 13>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 12>
<9, 11, 13>
<11, 12, 14>
<12, 13, 14>
<1, 10, 12>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 0, 8>
<7, 9, 12>
