Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges given in the graph. Let's organize the nodes with their neighbors:

1. Node 0: 7, 17, 19, 13, 6
2. Node 1: 2, 6, 19
3. Node 2: 5, 1
4. Node 3: 18, 14
5. Node 4: 7, 10, 16, 17
6. Node 5: 2
7. Node 6: 0, 1, 19
8. Node 7: 4, 0, 16, 15, 14
9. Node 8: 9
10. Node 9: 10, 8, 14
11. Node 10: 4, 9
12. Node 11: 13, 17
13. Node 12: 16, 13, 17
14. Node 13: 11, 0, 12
15. Node 14: 18, 9, 15, 3, 7
16. Node 15: 7, 18, 14
17. Node 16: 4, 7, 12
18. Node 17: 4, 11, 0, 12
19. Node 18: 14, 15, 3
20. Node 19: 0, 1, 6

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 14, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 36 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 13, 17)>
<0, (7, 13, 19)>
<0, (7, 6, 19)>
<0, (17, 13, 19)>
<0, (17, 6, 19)>
<1, (2, 6, 19)>
<6, (0, 1, 19)>
<7, (0, 14, 15)>
<7, (4, 16, 17)>
<7, (14, 15, 18)>
<7, (14, 17, 18)>
<14, (9, 15, 18)>
<14, (9, 15, 3)>
<14, (9, 18, 3)>
<14, (7, 15, 18)>
<14, (7, 17, 18)>
<17, (0, 12, 13)>
<17, (4, 12, 16)>
<17, (11, 12, 13)>
<17, (11, 0, 13)>
