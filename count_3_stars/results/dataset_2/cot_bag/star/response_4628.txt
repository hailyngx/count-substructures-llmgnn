Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 100 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph, which consists of 15 nodes and 60 edges, is [100].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 10, 13)>
<2, (3, 6, 11)>
<4, (0, 7, 11)>
<6, (0, 12, 14)>
