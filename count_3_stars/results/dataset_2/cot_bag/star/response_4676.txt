Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes that form at least one 3-star.

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, and 8.   
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9.  
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, and 9.  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 7.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each qualifying node and summing them up:

- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 52.  

Inside brackets: [52]  
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>  
<0, (4, 5, 9)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<3, (0, 5, 9)>  
<3, (0, 4, 5)>  
<6, (0, 1, 8)>  
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
