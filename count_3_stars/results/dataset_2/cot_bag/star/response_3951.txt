Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 27) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 17) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 20) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 25) (26, 14) (26, 20) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 1) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 17) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 22) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 23) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 0) (22, 6) (22, 7) (22, 0) (22, 20) (20, 28) (20, 26) (20, 22) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 23) (19, 3) (19, 29) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 23) (24, 25) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 22) (25, 11) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 24) (25, 16) (23, 3) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 27) (23, 24) (16, 15) (16, 25) (10, 20) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 65

So, the total number of 3-stars is [65], and the unique 3-stars found are:
