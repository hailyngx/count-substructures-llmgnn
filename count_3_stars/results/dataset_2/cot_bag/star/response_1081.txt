Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 29) (22, 18) (12, 18) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 23) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 4) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 4) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 29) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 25) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 7) (28, 19) (28, 8) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 14) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (14, 21) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (23, 18) (23, 27) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (24, 9) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 23) (16, 14) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 16) (9, 24) (7, 17) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 18, 27, 0, 20, 17, 29, 19, 26, 1, 15, 21, 4, 10, 8, 28, 6, 5, 14, 23, 25, 2, 16, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not contribute to any 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it does not contribute to any 3-star.

Adding up all the contributions, the total number of 3-stars is \([ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 ] = [ 90 ]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <18, (22, 23, 12)>
- <27, (12, 1, 13)>
- <0, (20, 3, 17)>
- <17, (0, 15, 7)>
- <19, (26, 2, 28)>
- <21, (23, 5, 14)>
- <4, (29, 26, 23)>
- <10, (19, 2, 14)>
- <8, (28, 6, 25)>
- <5, (21, 24, 14)>
