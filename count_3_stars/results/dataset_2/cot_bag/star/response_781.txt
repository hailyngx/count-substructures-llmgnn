Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (17, 1) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (6, 15) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 12, and 15.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 15.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11 and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 15 and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 14, 15, and 16.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 10.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 19.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 9.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 12.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 13, and 17.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (2, 7, 12)>
- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (14, 17, 18)>
- Node 5 forms 1 unique 3-star: <5, (17, 18, 19)>
- Node 9 forms 1 unique 3-star: <9, (14, 15, 16)>
- Node 11 forms 6 unique 3-stars: <11, (3, 4, 8)>, <11, (3, 8, 10)>, <11, (4, 8, 10)>, <11, (3, 8, 13)>, <11, (4, 8, 13)>, <11, (8, 10, 13)>
- Node 15 forms 3 unique 3-stars: <15, (3, 6, 7)>, <15, (3, 7, 9)>, <15, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 18 forms 1 unique 3-star: <18, (1, 5, 12)>
- Node 19 forms 1 unique 3-star: <19, (5, 6, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 15.
