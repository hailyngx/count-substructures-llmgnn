Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node.
- For the node with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For the node with 3 neighbors: There is no 3-star formed.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 \times 3 + 4 + 0 + 10 \times 5 = 62 \)

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 7, 14)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 14)>, <5, (2, 8, 10)>, <6, (2, 7, 10)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <10, (1, 5, 7)>, <11, (3, 6, 14)>, <14, (1, 3, 7)> 

Putting the final number inside brackets gives: [62].
