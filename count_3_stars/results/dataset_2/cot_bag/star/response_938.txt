Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are:  
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 13  
- Node 1 with 3 neighbors: 6, 9  
- Node 2 with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 17  
- Node 3 with 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 17  
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 11, 12  
- Node 5 with 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 15  
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 1  
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 12, 18  
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 14  
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 17  
- Node 12 with 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 15  
- Node 15 with 4 neighbors: 5, 12, 18, 19  
- Node 17 with 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 11, 17  
- Node 18 with 4 neighbors: 8, 15, 16, 19  
- Node 19 with 3 neighbors: 7, 18, 15  

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors and sum them up:  
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- For Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \)

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (6, 11, 13)>  
<2, (4, 5, 17)>  
<3, (8, 9, 17)>  
<4, (2, 6, 11)>  
<5, (2, 6, 15)>  
<6, (0, 4, 5)>  
<8, (3, 10, 18)>  
<10, (7, 8, 14)>  
<11, (0, 4, 17)>  
<12, (4, 8, 15)>  
<15, (5, 12, 18)>  
<17, (2, 3, 11)>  
<18, (8, 15, 16)>  
<19, (7, 15, 18)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
