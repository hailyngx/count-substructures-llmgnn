Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 3) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 16) (10, 6) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 19) (7, 17) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above, we get a total of 39 3-stars in the graph: \([39]\).
