Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

From the given edge list, we observe that each node has three or more neighbors, thus has the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [67].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
