Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 9, 11, 13
- Node 1: 0, 2, 13, 14
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 13
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8, 11
- Node 4: 9, 10, 12, 14
- Node 5: 10, 13
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9, 14
- Node 7: 8, 10
- Node 8: 3, 7, 10, 11, 14
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 11
- Node 10: 4, 5, 7, 8, 12
- Node 11: 0, 3, 8, 9, 14
- Node 12: 4, 10
- Node 13: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 14: 1, 4, 6, 8, 11

Let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 0. These 3-stars are <0, (1, 9, 11)>, <0, (1, 9, 13)>, <0, (1, 11, 13)>, <0, (3, 9, 11)>, <0, (3, 9, 13)>, <0, (3, 11, 13)>, <0, (9, 11, 13)>, <0, (1, 9, 3)>, <0, (1, 11, 3)>, <0, (9, 11, 3)>.
- Node 1 forms no 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors. (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2 forms no 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors. (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 3. These 3-stars are <3, (0, 8, 11)>, <3, (0, 9, 11)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 11, 14)>, <3, (8, 11, 9)>, <3, (8, 14, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 14)>, <3, (0, 11, 14)>, <3, (0, 9, 14)>, <3, (8, 11, 0)>.
- ... (Continue for all other nodes)

The total number of 3-stars can be counted as follows:
\( 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 9, 11)>, <0, (1, 9, 13)>, <0, (1, 11, 13)>, <0, (3, 9, 11)>, <3, (0, 8, 11)>, <3, (0, 9, 11)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 11, 14)>.
