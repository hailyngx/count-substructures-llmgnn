Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 9, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 0
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8, 0

Now we can find the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the 3-stars we found for each node: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
