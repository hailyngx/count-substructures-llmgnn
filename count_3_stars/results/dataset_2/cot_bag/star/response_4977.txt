Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 6), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 2), (1, 0), (3, 8), (8, 2), (8, 3), (6, 4), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 2)

Let's determine the 3-star configurations:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors. (Not considered for 3-star)
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [42] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 9, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 4)>, <5, (2, 9, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <9, (1, 4, 2)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>
