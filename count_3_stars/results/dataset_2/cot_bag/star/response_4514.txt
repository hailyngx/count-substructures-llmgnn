Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 2, 8, 3
- Node 1: 9, 4, 8, 6
- Node 2: 7, 8, 0
- Node 3: 5, 9, 7, 0
- Node 4: 7, 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 4, 8, 1
- Node 7: 9, 4, 3, 2, 8
- Node 8: 9, 7, 2, 0, 6, 1
- Node 9: 8, 3, 1, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
