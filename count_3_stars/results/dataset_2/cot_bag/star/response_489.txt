Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 18) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 6) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 17) (18, 29) (28, 22) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (26, 12) (26, 17) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 4) (6, 25) (8, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 27) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 24) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (19, 25) (19, 23) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 27) (5, 2) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 14) (24, 5) (22, 28) (22, 5) (17, 18) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 5) (10, 13) (12, 11) (12, 26) (12, 17) (23, 7) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 27) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 2) (27, 23) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
The graph given is as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}
- Edges: [(7, 21), (7, 23), (21, 7), (21, 6), (21, 18), (1, 3), (1, 25), (1, 9), (3, 1), (3, 13), (0, 20), (0, 29), (0, 2), (20, 0), (20, 27), (20, 6), (4, 18), (4, 6), (4, 15), (18, 21), (18, 4), (18, 24), (18, 17), (18, 29), (28, 22), (11, 14), (11, 13), (11, 12), (26, 12), (26, 17), (6, 21), (6, 20), (6, 4), (6, 25), (8, 14), (9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 16), (9, 27), (16, 9), (16, 24), (16, 17), (14, 11), (14, 8), (14, 23), (14, 24), (15, 4), (15, 9), (15, 25), (19, 25), (19, 23), (2, ...
- Number of Nodes: 30
- Number of Edges: 90

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
