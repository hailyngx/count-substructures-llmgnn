Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 65 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [65]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
