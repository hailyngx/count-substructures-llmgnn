Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 14) (0, 6) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 9) (16, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 15) (13, 19) (13, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 14
- Node 1: 5, 18
- Node 2: 11, 16
- Node 3: 7, 9, 14
- Node 4: 9, 10, 13
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 18
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 3, 10, 11
- Node 8: 5, 17, 19
- Node 9: 3, 4, 12, 13, 19
- Node 10: 4, 7, 14
- Node 11: 2, 7, 12, 17
- Node 12: 9, 11, 18
- Node 13: 4, 9, 19
- Node 14: 0, 3, 10, 17
- Node 15: 17, 18
- Node 16: 2
- Node 17: 8, 11, 14, 15, 19
- Node 18: 1, 5, 12, 15
- Node 19: 8, 13, 17, 9

Calculations for 3-stars:
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (5, 17, 19)>
<9, (3, 12, 19)>
<9, (4, 12, 19)>
<9, (3, 9, 19)>
<9, (9, 13, 19)>
<9, (9, 4, 19)>
<11, (2, 7, 11)>
<11, (7, 12, 17)>
<11, (7, 11, 17)>
<14, (0, 10, 14)>
<17, (8, 11, 17)>
<17, (15, 17, 18)>
<18, (1, 12, 18)>
<19, (8, 13, 19)>
