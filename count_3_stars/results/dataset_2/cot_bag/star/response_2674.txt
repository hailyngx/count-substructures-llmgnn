Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4, there are 5 neighbors: 14, 11, 6, 3, and 2. Thus, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4.

For node 6, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 0, 2, and 3. We have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6.

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 10, and 5. There is only 1 3-star with node 7.

For node 10, there are 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 3, 2, and 14. We have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10.

For node 11, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 5, 8, and 12. We have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11.

For node 12, there are 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 9, and 2. We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 12.

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 3, and 6. We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (14, 11, 6)>, <4, (14, 11, 3)>, <4, (14, 11, 2)>, <4, (11, 6, 3)>, <4, (11, 6, 2)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <6, (4, 13, 0)>, <6, (4, 13, 2)>, <6, (13, 0, 2)>, <7, (0, 10, 5)>, <10, (7, 11, 3)>, <10, (7, 11, 2)>, <10, (11, 3, 2)>, <11, (4, 10, 5)>, <12, (11, 13, 9)>.
