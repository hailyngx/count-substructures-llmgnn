Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 15) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 20) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 29) (2, 28) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 11) (8, 6) (4, 24) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 26) (13, 3) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 29) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 27) (29, 15) (29, 3) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 25) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 8) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 25) (23, 7) (23, 5) (23, 12) (1, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 18) (9, 21) (9, 11) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 23) (12, 6) (14, 19) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 0) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:

0: 2  
1: 2  
2: 1  
3: 4  
4: 3  
5: 4  
6: 3  
7: 5  
8: 4  
9: 2  
10: 4  
11: 4  
12: 4  
13: 3  
14: 1  
15: 3  
16: 3  
17: 5  
18: 3  
19: 4  
20: 2  
21: 3  
22: 4  
23: 3  
24: 3  
25: 2  
26: 4  
27: 4  
28: 3  
29: 3  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.  

For node 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 17, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 27, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 22, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 26, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 19, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 28, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For node 24, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For node 23, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For node 12, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 45 3-stars.  

So, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in the graph.  

Here are the unique 3-stars:
