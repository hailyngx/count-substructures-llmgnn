Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the nodes have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 has inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 0 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42. 

Therefore, the final answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 2, 8)>
<5, (7, 4, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (8, 7, 2)>
