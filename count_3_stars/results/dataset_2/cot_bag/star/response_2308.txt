Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 6, and 3.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-star configurations with node 4 as the center: <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 9, 4, 12, 0, 10, and 1.
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Unique 3-star configurations with node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 4, 12)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 10)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 12, 0)>, <7, (9, 12, 10)>, <7, (9, 12, 1)>, <7, (9, 0, 10)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (9, 10, 1)>, <7, (4, 12, 0)>, <7, (4, 12, 10)>, <7, (4, 12, 1)>, <7, (4, 0, 10)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 10, 1)>, <7, (12, 0, 10)>, <7, (12, 0, 1)>, <7, (12, 10, 1)>, <7, (0, 10, 1)>.

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 3, 2, 0, and 11.
- Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Unique 3-star configurations with node 12 as the center: <12, (9, 7, 3)>, <12, (9, 7, 2)>, <12, (9, 7, 0)>, <12, (9, 7, 11)>, <12, (9, 3, 2)>, <12, (9, 3, 0)>, <12, (9, 3, 11)>, <12, (9, 2, 0)>, <12, (9, 2, 11)>, <12, (9, 0, 11)>, <12, (7, 3, 2)>, <12, (7, 3, 0)>, <12, (7, 3, 11)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 11)>, <12, (7, 0, 11)>, <12, (3, 2, 0)>, <12, (3, 2, 11)>, <12, (3, 0, 11)>, <12, (2, 0, 11)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 20 + 20 = 44. 
So, the final answer is [44].
