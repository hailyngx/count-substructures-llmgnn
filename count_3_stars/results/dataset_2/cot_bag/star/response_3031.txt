Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: It has 5 neighbors (7, 9, 3, 8, 5), so the total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 9, 3)>, <0, (7, 3, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 5)>, <0, (9, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>.

For node 1: It has 5 neighbors (4, 6, 2, 5, 8), so the total number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 2, 5)>, <1, (6, 2, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>.

For node 4: It has 5 neighbors (7, 5, 1, 3, 0), so the total number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 3, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <4, (1, 3, 0)>.

For node 7: It has 5 neighbors (4, 0, 6, 2, 8), so the total number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us \[ [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40]. \]
