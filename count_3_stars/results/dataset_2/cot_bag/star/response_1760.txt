Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions from each node, we get a total of 33 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<1, (6, 8, 16)>, <3, (12, 9, 17)>, <6, (1, 8, 19)>, <7, (2, 14, 19)>, <9, (11, 12, 17)>, <11, (6, 9, 15)>, <12, (2, 9, 17)>, <13, (4, 8, 17)>, <15, (4, 5, 8)>, <16, (0, 1, 19)>, <17, (10, 13, 3)>, <19, (6, 7, 16)>.
