Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (2, 5) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 13
Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 11, 13
Node 2: 5, 14
Node 3: 4, 6, 9, 10, 11
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 10
Node 5: 2, 4, 11, 12
Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 13, 14
Node 7: 1, 6, 13, 14
Node 8: 0, 10, 11, 12
Node 9: 3, 11, 13, 14
Node 10: 3, 4, 8
Node 11: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14
Node 12: 5, 8, 13
Node 13: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 12
Node 14: 2, 6, 7, 9, 11

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: [1, 4, 8, 13] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 1: [0, 6, 7, 11, 13] ->  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
For Node 3: [4, 6, 9, 10, 11] ->  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
For Node 4: [0, 3, 5, 10] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 5: [2, 4, 11, 12] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 6: [1, 3, 7, 13, 14] ->  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
For Node 7: [1, 6, 13, 14] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 8: [0, 10, 11, 12] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 9: [3, 11, 13, 14] ->  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
For Node 11: [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14] ->  6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
For Node 12: [5, 8, 13] ->  3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
For Node 13: [0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 12] ->  6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
For Node 14: [2, 6, 7, 9, 11] ->  5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 101

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [101]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 4, 8>
<4, 0, 13>
<4, 5, 11>
<1, 6, 13>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 11>
<3, 6, 13>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 10, 4>
<3, 10, 8>
<1, 11, 13>
<1, 11, 14>
<5, 11, 12>
<7, 13, 6>
