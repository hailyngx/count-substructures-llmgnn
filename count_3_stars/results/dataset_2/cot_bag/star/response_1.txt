Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 8, 0, 7, 1, 2, 12, 3, 11, 14, 10, and 13.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (9, 12, 4)>
- <9, (0, 5, 10)>
- <4, (8, 5, 11)>
- <8, (0, 4, 14)>
- <0, (9, 8, 7)>
- <7, (0, 11, 1)>
- <1, (7, 2, 14)>
- <2, (0, 1, 12)>
- <12, (5, 6, 2)>
- <3, (6, 4, 12)>
- <11, (6, 7, 4)>
- <14, (8, 1, 2)>
- <10, (9, 1, 2)>
- <13, (11, 14, 3)>
