Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 5) (15, 25) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 8) (9, 29) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 10) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 25) (21, 28) (21, 5) (21, 2) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (11, 14) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 20) (26, 11) (26, 29) (20, 11) (20, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 8) (29, 4) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 20) (4, 29) (4, 16) (3, 2) (23, 18) (23, 24) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 1) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 24) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 18) (8, 24) (24, 23) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (2, 10) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 24) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (25, 14) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 21) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.

For node 1, there are 4 possible 3-stars: <1, (7, 11, 18)>, <1, (7, 11, 24)>, <1, (7, 18, 24)>, <1, (11, 18, 24)>.

For node 4, there are 1 possible 3-star: <4, (12, 20, 29)>.

For node 7, there are 1 possible 3-star: <7, (1, 14, 18)>.

For node 10, there are 2 possible 3-stars: <10, (2, 16, 21)>, <10, (4, 16, 19)>.

For node 11, there are 1 possible 3-star: <11, (1, 20, 26)>.

For node 12, there are 1 possible 3-star: <12, (4, 25, 27)>.

For node 14, there are 1 possible 3-star: <14, (7, 25, 28)>.

For node 18, there are 1 possible 3-star: <18, (1, 8, 23)>.

For node 22, there are 1 possible 3-star: <22, (4, 5, 28)>.

For node 24, there are 2 possible 3-stars: <24, (1, 8, 23)>, <24, (2, 8, 23)>.

For node 25, there are 1 possible 3-star: <25, (12, 14, 15)>.

For node 27, there are 1 possible 3-star: <27, (7, 8, 12)>.

For node 28, there are 1 possible 3-star: <28, (5, 14, 21)>.

For node 29, there are 1 possible 3-star: <29, (4, 8, 26)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations gives us [16].
