Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 0) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (2, 18) (2, 28) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 28) (8, 25) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 29) (12, 2) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 15) (17, 22) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 28) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 26) (23, 26) (23, 1) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 0) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 29) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 3) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 14) (21, 5) (21, 24) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 27) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 17) (28, 27) (20, 18) (24, 19) (24, 21) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 28) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 2 neighbors
- Node 22: 4 neighbors
- Node 23: 2 neighbors
- Node 24: 2 neighbors
- Node 25: 5 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars and list them:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (3, 29, 26)>, <0, (3, 9, 27)>, <0, (4, 29, 1)>, <0, (4, 13, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (23, 29, 4)>
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars: <2, (12, 18, 11)>, <2, (18, 11, 14)>, <2, (18, 20, 28)>, <2, (28, 17, 5)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (9, 10, 14)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (21, 24, 19)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (16, 19, 25)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 27, 28)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (14, 16, 7)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (5, 17, 22)>
- Node 25 forms 10 3-stars: <25, (8, 1, 29)>, <25, (8, 1, 23)>, <25, (8, 19, 16)>, <25, (8, 19, 24)>, <25, (8, 19, 25)>, <25, (8, 19, 16)>, <25, (19, 24, 21)>, <25, (19, 16, 14)>, <25, (19, 16, 15)>, <25, (19, 16, 25)>
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star: <26, (0, 13, 5)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [26] 3-stars in the graph.
