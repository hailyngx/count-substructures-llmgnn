Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
Solving for the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 11, 16, 10, 19 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 13, 10 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 12 --> 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 12, 14, 8 --> 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 15, 1 --> 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 16, 19, 18 --> 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 3, 1 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 19 --> 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 0, 16 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 16, 0, 18, 17 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 11 as the center.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 16, 4, 3 --> 1 3-star with node 12 as the center.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 18, 1 --> No 3-stars formed.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 9, 4, 8 --> 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5 --> No 3-stars formed.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 11, 7, 0, 12 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 11, 7, 2, 13 --> [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars with node 18 as the center.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, 0 --> 1 3-star with node 19 as the center.

Counting all the 3-stars gives a total of 33.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 10, 16)>
<1, (5, 8, 13)>
<3, (2, 8, 12)>
<4, (12, 14, 8)>
<5, (6, 15, 1)>
<7, (16, 19, 18)>
<8, (9, 14, 1)>
<9, (8, 14, 19)>
<10, (6, 1, 0)>
<11, (16, 0, 18)>
<12, (16, 4, 3)>
<14, (9, 4, 8)>
<19, (9, 7, 0)>
<18, (11, 7, 2)>
