Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 18) (3, 5) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 19) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (16, 10) (16, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these, the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 12, 13)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 18)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 13, 17)>
<9, (4, 10, 18)>
<10, (11, 16, 9)>
<12, (0, 13, 15)>
<13, (7, 12, 17)>
<14, (5, 6, 16)>
<16, (10, 14, 17)>
<17, (11, 13, 7)>
<18, (2, 9, 19)>
<19, (4, 6, 7)>
