Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 11) (6, 0) (6, 16) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 16) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 3-stars
- Node 10: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 3 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 3-stars
- Node 17: 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 9, 16)>
<3, (0, 14, 15)>
<4, (9, 12, 19)>
<8, (7, 14, 15)>
<8, (10, 14, 19)>
<8, (14, 15, 16)>
<8, (14, 15, 19)>
<8, (14, 19, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 16)>
<9, (4, 13, 19)>
<9, (4, 9, 16)>
<10, (8, 17, 5)>
<10, (17, 11, 13)>
<10, (17, 4, 10)>
<12, (11, 18, 4)>
<14, (14, 16, 9)>
<16, (14, 16, 9)>
<16, (1, 9, 16)>
<16, (16, 9, 14)>
<17, (10, 11, 13)>
<17, (17, 11, 4)>
<17, (17, 4, 10)>
<17, (17, 4, 11)>
<17, (17, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the final answer is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 9, 16)>, <3, (0, 14, 15)>, <4, (9, 12, 19)>, <8, (7, 14, 15)>, <8, (10, 14, 19)>, <8, (14, 15, 16)>, <8, (14, 15, 19)>, <8, (14, 19, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <9, (4, 13, 19)>, <9, (4, 9, 16)>, <10, (8, 17, 5)>, <10, (17, 11, 13)>, <10, (17, 4, 10)>, <12, (11, 18, 4)>, <14, (14, 16, 9)>, <16, (14, 16, 9)>, <16, (1, 9, 16)>, <16, (16, 9, 14)>, <17, (10, 11, 13)>, <17, (17, 11, 4)>, <17, (17, 4, 10)>, <17, (17, 4, 11)>, <17, (17, 4, 13)>.
