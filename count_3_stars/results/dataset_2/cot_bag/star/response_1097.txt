Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: 4 neighbors (5, 7, 2, 3)
Node 1: 1 neighbor (9)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (9, 4, 8, 0)
Node 3: 4 neighbors (5, 4, 7, 6)
Node 4: 4 neighbors (7, 8, 2, 1)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (9, 6, 0, 3)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 7)
Node 7: 4 neighbors (4, 8, 0, 3)
Node 8: 2 neighbors (4, 2)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 2, 1)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with each of these nodes.
- Nodes 7 has exactly 4 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with it.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 7 * 4 + 1 = 29 \)

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in the given graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
[<0, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (4, 8, 0)>]
