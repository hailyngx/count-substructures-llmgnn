Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 19) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 19) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 15) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 11) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

1. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (4, 16, 13) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
2. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (19, 15, 18) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
3. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (13, 2, 9, 5) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
4. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (14, 8, 3, 12) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (8, 2, 1) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
6. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (14, 18, 11, 15) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
7. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (17, 4, 10, 19) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
8. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (8, 5, 12, 15) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
9. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (8, 7, 0) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
10. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (2, 10, 3) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
11. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (9, 11, 1) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
12. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (18, 12, 19) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
13. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7, 0, 15) -> Total 3-stars: [4]
14. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (13, 7, 12) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
15. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (17, 16, 10) -> Total 3-stars: [1]
16. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (5, 0) -> Total 3-stars: [0]
17. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (17, 4, 2, 11) -> Total 3-stars: [4]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all relevant nodes: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

So, there are a total of 30 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<14, (4, 16, 13)>, <17, (19, 15, 18)>, <8, (13, 2, 9)>, <8, (13, 3, 12)>, <8, (13, 2, 5)>, <13, (14, 3, 12)>, <13, (14, 3, 8)>, <13, (14, 8, 3)>, <13, (8, 3, 12)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <4, (14, 15, 18)>, <4, (14, 15, 11)>, <4, (14, 18, 11)>, <4, (18, 17, 15)>, <18, (17, 10, 19)>, <18, (17, 4, 10)>, <18, (17, 4, 14)>, <18, (4, 14, 15)>, <2, (8, 12, 15)>, <2, (8, 12, 3)>, <2, (8, 15, 12)>, <2, (8, 5, 15)>, <9, (0, 8, 7)>, <11, (0, 4, 7)>, <11, (4, 7, 15)>, <11, (4, 15, 18)>, <11, (7, 0, 4)>, <15, (2, 11, 17)>, <15, (4, 11, 17)>, <15, (4, 11, 18)>.
