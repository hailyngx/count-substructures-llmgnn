Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 9) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 2) (7, 24) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 10) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 25) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 3) (26, 5) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 20) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 20) (8, 16) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 22) (19, 23) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 3) (6, 10) (25, 14) (25, 23) (20, 28) (20, 13) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 4) (3, 23) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 12) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 24) (29, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with less than 3 neighbors are: 

- Node 1 has neighbors: 21, 12
- Node 5 has neighbors: 26, 13, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 10
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 0, 2
- Node 15 has neighbors: 27, 9
- Node 17 has neighbors: 7, 10
- Node 19 has neighbors: 22, 23
- Node 26 has neighbors: 5
- Node 29 has neighbors: 16

Therefore, we will only consider the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to find the 3-stars. 

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 11, 22, 14, 24
- Node 2 has neighbors: 11, 21, 18, 13, 4
- Node 3 has neighbors: 27, 18, 4, 23
- Node 4 has neighbors: 18, 2, 28, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 24, 17
- Node 8 has neighbors: 16, 28, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 16, 15, 8
- Node 10 has neighbors: 16, 21, 17, 6, 13
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 22, 24
- Node 13 has neighbors: 10, 2, 5, 20
- Node 14 has neighbors: 0, 25
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 29, 8, 9, 10
- Node 18 has neighbors: 27, 22, 2, 4, 3
- Node 21 has neighbors: 1, 10, 2
- Node 22 has neighbors: 18, 19, 0, 12
- Node 23 has neighbors: 19, 25, 3
- Node 24 has neighbors: 7, 0, 12
- Node 25 has neighbors: 14, 23

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node: 
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 23: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 24: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 25: inom{2}{3} = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 52

So, the total number of 3-stars is [52].
