Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 21) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 8) (20, 3) (8, 2) (8, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 26) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 17) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 19) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 1) (14, 26) (14, 3) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (25, 2) (25, 1) (25, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 26) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 23) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 21) (21, 9) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 24) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 27) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 29) (5, 29) (5, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 6, 9, 11, 18, 26, 28, 29, 21, 23, and 1. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so there are 0 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 45\)

The total number of 3-stars is 45, so we present the unique 3-stars found:

\[
\begin{align*}
&<6, 0, 12, 23>, \\
&<11, 4, 12, 24>, \\
&<18, 2, 7, 23>, \\
&<18, 7, 23, 29>, \\
&<26, 4, 16, 28>, \\
&<26, 14, 16, 29>, \\
&<26, 14, 26, 29>, \\
&<26, 16, 26, 28>, \\
&<26, 16, 28, 29>, \\
&<28, 0, 17, 26>, \\
&<29, 12, 5, 22>, \\
&<29, 12, 21, 22>, \\
&<21, 9, 21, 29>, \\
&<23, 6, 10, 23>, \\
&<23, 7, 22, 23>, \\
&<23, 7, 24, 23>, \\
&<1, 13, 22, 25>, \\
&<1, 22, 25, 27>
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [45].
