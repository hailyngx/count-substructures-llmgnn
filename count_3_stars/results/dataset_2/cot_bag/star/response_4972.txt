Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: 6 neighbors  
Node 1: 5 neighbors  
Node 3: 5 neighbors  
Node 4: 4 neighbors  
Node 5: 3 neighbors  
Node 6: 6 neighbors  
Node 7: 4 neighbors  
Node 9: 3 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:  
Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: 1 3-star  
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 9: 1 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 70  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 3, 6)>  
<0, (1, 4, 6)>  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<0, (3, 6, 7)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<0, (4, 6, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>  
<1, (3, 6, 8)>  
<1, (4, 6, 7)>  
<1, (4, 6, 8)>  
<1, (6, 7, 8)>  
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (4, 6, 8)>  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>  
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
