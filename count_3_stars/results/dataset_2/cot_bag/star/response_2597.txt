Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form. 

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (5, 9, 6). Hence, we can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (9, 2, 4). Hence, we can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 2: It has 4 neighbors (5, 1, 3, 8). Hence, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 4: It has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 1, 6, 2). Hence, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 5: It has 5 neighbors (6, 2, 4, 0, 7). Hence, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 6: It has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 4, 0). Hence, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 7: It has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 1, 3, 6). Hence, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 9: It has 5 neighbors (8, 4, 1, 7, 0). Hence, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 50.

Therefore, there are 50 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [50].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
