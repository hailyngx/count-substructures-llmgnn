Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars each can form. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 1. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 6, 0. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 6, 3. It can form 1 3-star by choosing any 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 2. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 8, 0, 3, 1, 2. It can form 1 3-star by choosing any 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 2, 8. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 1, 3, 0. It can form 1 3-star by choosing any 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 8, 0. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 1. It can form 1 3-star by choosing any 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 8, 2. It cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
- <0, 7, 4, 8>
- <1, 0, 4, 8>
- <2, 3, 4, 6>
- <4, 5, 6, 8>

So, the final answer is [4].
