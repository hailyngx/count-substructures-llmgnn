Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {7, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {9, 12, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 14, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 11, 10}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 12, 13, 0}
- Node 8: {12}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 3, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {3, 0, 1, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 12, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 2, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 1, 3, 10}
  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 1: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 4: [1 = 1]
- Node 5: [1 = 1]
- Node 6: [1 = 1]
- Node 7: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 8: [1 = 1]
- Node 9: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 10: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 11: [1 = 1]
- Node 12: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 13: [1 = 1]
- Node 14: [1 = 1]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 70

So, there are 70 3-stars in total. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 12, 11)> <0, (7, 12, 10)> <0, (7, 11, 10)> <0, (12, 11, 10)>
<1, (9, 2, 14)> <1, (9, 2, 10)> <1, (9, 14, 10)> <1, (2, 14, 10)>
<2, (9, 12, 1)> <2, (9, 12, 6)> <2, (9, 1, 6)> <2, (12, 1, 6)>
<3, (9, 11, 14)> <3, (9, 11, 10)> <3, (9, 14, 10)> <3, (11, 14, 10)>
<7, (9, 4, 13)> <7, (9, 4, 0)> <7, (9, 13, 0)> <7, (4, 13, 0)>
<9, (5, 13, 14)> <9, (5, 13, 7)> <9, (5, 13, 0)> <9, (13, 14, 7)>
<10, (1, 3, 14)> <10, (1, 3, 6)> <10, (1, 14, 6)> <10, (3, 14, 6)>
<12, (7, 2, 0)> <12, (7, 2, 11)> <12, (7, 0, 11)> <12, (2, 0, 11)>
