Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 2, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 18, 12, 16
- Node 9 has neighbors: 12, 1, 15
- Node 12 has neighbors: 6, 7, 16
- Node 13 has neighbors: 11, 19, 0
- Node 14 has neighbors: 2, 7, 15
- Node 15 has neighbors: 5, 9, 14
- Node 16 has neighbors: 7, 12, 10
- Node 17 has neighbors: 8, 5, 19
- Node 18 has neighbors: 19, 7, 18

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There is a total of 10 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <4, (8, 2, 3)>
2. <7, (18, 12, 16)>
3. <9, (12, 1, 15)>
4. <13, (11, 19, 0)>
5. <14, (2, 7, 15)>
6. <15, (5, 9, 14)>
7. <16, (7, 12, 10)>
8. <17, (8, 5, 19)>
9. <18, (19, 7, 18)>
10. <7, (14, 15, 10)>
