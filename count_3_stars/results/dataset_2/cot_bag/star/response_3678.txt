Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to consider the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Let's go through the nodes and count the number of 3-stars each node can form:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (4, 3, 1) => 1 3-star
Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 0, 12) => 1 3-star
Node 2: 3 neighbors (8, 10, 4) => 1 3-star
Node 3: 5 neighbors (13, 10, 11, 0, 14) => 10 3-stars <3, (10, 11, 0)>, <3, (10, 11, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 13)>, <3, (10, 13, 14)>, <3, (10, 0, 14)>, <3, (11, 0, 14)>, <3, (11, 0, 13)>, <3, (11, 13, 14)>, <3, (0, 13, 14)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>
Node 4: 5 neighbors (9, 8, 6, 2, 0) => 10 3-stars <4, (9, 8, 13)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 10)>, <4, (9, 13, 8)>, <4, (8, 6, 7)>, <4, (8, 2, 10)>, <4, (8, 2, 13)>, <4, (8, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 11)>
Node 5: 4 neighbors (9, 1, 7, 14) => 4 3-stars <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 14)>, <5, (9, 7, 14)>, <5, (1, 0, 12)>
Node 6: 2 neighbors (4, 7) => 0 3-stars
Node 7: 3 neighbors (5, 11, 6) => 1 3-star
Node 8: 4 neighbors (13, 4, 2, 12) => 4 3-stars <8, (13, 4, 9)>, <8, (13, 4, 6)>, <8, (13, 4, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 10)>
Node 9: 5 neighbors (5, 4, 14, 10, 13) => 10 3-stars <9, (5, 4, 14)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 0, 1)>, <9, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 10)>, <9, (4, 2, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (14, 13, 10)>
Node 10: 5 neighbors (9, 11, 3, 2, 14) => 10 3-stars <10, (9, 11, 3)>, <10, (9, 11, 7)>, <10, (9, 11, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 10)>, <10, (9, 3, 14)>, <10, (11, 3, 13)>, <10, (11, 7, 6)>, <10, (11, 7, 12)>, <10, (11, 12, 1)>, <10, (3, 0, 1)>
Node 11: 5 neighbors (13, 10, 7, 3, 12) => 10 3-stars <11, (13, 10, 9)>, <11, (13, 10, 3)>, <11, (13, 10, 14)>, <11, (13, 3, 0)>, <11, (13, 3, 14)>, <11, (10, 3, 0)>, <11, (10, 7, 6)>, <11, (10, 7, 12)>, <11, (10, 12, 1)>, <11, (3, 0, 1)>
Node 12: 3 neighbors (8, 11, 1) => 1 3-star
Node 13: 5 neighbors (9, 8, 11, 3, 14) => 10 3-stars <13, (9, 8, 4)>, <13, (9, 8, 2)>, <13, (9, 8, 10)>, <13, (9, 4, 6)>, <13, (9, 4, 0)>, <13, (8, 2, 10)>, <13, (8, 2, 4)>, <13, (8, 6, 7)>, <13, (8, 6, 4)>, <13, (4, 0, 3)>
Node 14: 5 neighbors (5, 9, 13, 10, 3) => 10 3-stars <14, (5, 9, 1)>, <14, (5, 9, 13)>, <14, (5, 9, 10)>, <14, (5, 1, 0)>, <14, (5, 1, 12)>, <14, (9, 13, 10)>, <14, (9, 10, 3)>, <14, (9, 10, 2)>, <14, (9, 3, 0)>, <14, (13, 3, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [53]
