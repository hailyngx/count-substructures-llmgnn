Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7
- Node 1 with 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3 with 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 6 with 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars are:
