Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 17) (4, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center. 

Let's start by listing the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 5 has neighbors 9, 13, and 19.  
Node 9 has neighbors 5, 15, and 2.  
Node 10 has neighbors 11, 12, and 13.  
Node 13 has neighbors 5, 10, 12, and 3.  
Node 19 has neighbors 5, 11, and 2.  
Node 2 has neighbors 9, 7, and 15.  
Node 6 has neighbors 1, 3, and 12.  
Node 11 has neighbors 10, 14, and 19.  
Node 3 has neighbors 13, 6, 14, 17, and 16.  
Node 17 has neighbors 3, 12, 8, and 4.  
Node 12 has neighbors 10, 13, 6, 17, and 0.  
Node 8 has neighbors 1, 17, 0, and 7.  
Node 4 has neighbors 17 and 16.  
Node 7 has neighbors 2, 18, 8, and 15.  
Node 15 has neighbors 9, 2, 7.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:  
- For nodes 5, 9, 13, 19, 2, 11, and 15, there is only 1 3-star each. So, there are 7 in total.
- For nodes 10, 6, and 17, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- For nodes 3, 12, and 8, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 only has 4 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.
- Node 4 only has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<13, 10, 12>  
<13, 3, 6>

<13, 3, 17>  
<13, 3, 16>  
<19, 11, 5>  
<2, 9, 15>  
<6, 3, 12>  
<6, 3, 17>  
<6, 3, 14>  
<11, 10, 13>  
<17, 3, 12>  
<17, 3, 8>  
<17, 3, 4>  
<12, 10, 13>  
<12, 10, 6>  
<12, 10, 17>  
<12, 10, 0>
