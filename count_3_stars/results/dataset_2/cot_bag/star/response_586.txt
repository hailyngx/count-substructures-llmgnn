Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 5) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 17) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above, we get a total of 34 3-stars in the graph [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 17)>
<0, (2, 18, 6)>
<0, (3, 14, 8)>
<0, (3, 17, 5)>
<2, (0, 17, 5)>
<2, (10, 11, 7)>
<3, (0, 17, 5)>
<3, (9, 19, 6)>
<6, (12, 10, 2)>
<8, (14, 19, 3)>
<10, (11, 7, 15)>
<11, (10, 16, 6)>
<12, (1, 13, 15)>
<14, (19, 8, 18)>
<16, (6, 19, 8)>
<17, (0, 3, 19)>
<19, (6, 18, 8)>
