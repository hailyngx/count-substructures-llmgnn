Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
<1, (6, 7, 13)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
<2, (9, 13, 17)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors. Therefore, there is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
<3, (0, 6, 17)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors. Therefore, there is only 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
<4, (12, 16, 19)>

Node 16 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
<16, (4, 11, 19)>

Adding up all the found 3-stars, we get a total of [14].
