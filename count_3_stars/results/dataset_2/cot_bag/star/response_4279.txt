Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 5
- Node 12: 5
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph: 

For nodes with degree greater than or equal to 3:
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 11, 6)>
<2, (4, 14, 1)>
<3, (11, 6, 12)>
<4, (7, 1, 14)>
<6, (11, 3, 12)>
<7, (4, 9, 13)>
<8, (7, 10, 12)>
<9, (7, 0, 14)>
<11, (2, 13, 6)>
<12, (5, 6, 3)>
<13, (2, 0, 4)>
<14, (4, 9, 2)>
