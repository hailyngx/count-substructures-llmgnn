Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 5) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (10, 16) (10, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, and 17. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 14, 19)>
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 18)>
<4, (7, 17, 19)>
<5, (3, 10, 18)>
<6, (2, 7, 17)>
<7, (4, 6, 18)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<11, (5, 16, 17)>
<15, (0, 1, 18)>
<16, (2, 10, 11)>
<17, (4, 6, 11)>
