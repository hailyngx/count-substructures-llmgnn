Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 27) (6, 24) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (5, 27) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 23) (26, 11) (26, 12) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 25) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 18) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 22) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 24) (24, 6) (24, 16) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (10, 14) (10, 28) (10, 29) (25, 21) (25, 29) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 29) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 20) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 23) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 20) (12, 1) (12, 26) (12, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
15. Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
16. Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
17. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
19. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 46 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (13, 18, 22)>
<2, (7, 17, 23)>
<4, (6, 15, 20)>
<7, (0, 2, 16)>
<8, (2, 13, 21)>
<11, (3, 13, 26)>
<13, (0, 3, 8)>
<15, (4, 16, 20)>
<16, (7, 15, 24)>
<18, (11, 15, 23)>
<19, (7, 18, 22)>
<21, (12, 15, 25)>
<23, (9, 18, 29)>
<27, (5, 17, 20)>
<28, (8, 10, 21)>
<29, (10, 23, 25)>
