Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41 \)

So, there are in total [41] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
