Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [6 choose 3] = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: [6 choose 3] = 20 3-stars
- Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [72].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
