Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors: node 4, node 7, node 1, node 8, node 12, node 5, node 13, node 9, node 10, and node 0. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> <4, (7, 8, 10)>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (12, 6, 9)>, <7, (12, 10, 9)>, <7, (6, 14, 10)>, <7, (6, 14, 13)>, <7, (6, 14, 1)>, <7, (6, 10, 4)>, <7, (6, 10, 13)>, <7, (12, 10, 4)>, <7, (12, 10, 13)>

For node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> <1, (14, 8, 5)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 13)>, <8, (9, 5, 0)>, <8, (9, 5, 13)>, <8, (9, 12, 5)>, <8, (1, 13, 5)>, <8, (1, 13, 7)>, <8, (9, 12, 1)>, <8, (9, 12, 13)>

For node 12:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> <12, (7, 10, 9)>, <12, (7, 10, 6)>, <12, (7, 10, 13)>, <12, (7, 11, 10)>, <12, (11, 5, 0)>, <12, (11, 0, 6)>, <12, (11, 5, 13)>, <12, (11, 0, 6)>, <12, (11, 0, 5)>, <12, (11, 5, 13)>

For node 5, node 13, node 9, node 10, and node 0: Since these nodes have less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
