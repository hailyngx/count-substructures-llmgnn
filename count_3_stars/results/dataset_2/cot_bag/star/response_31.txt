Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 9) (22, 19) (22, 25) (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 20) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 21) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 5) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 10) (4, 27) (4, 12) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 22) (19, 8) (19, 25) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 24) (10, 0) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 23) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 7) (7, 11) (7, 26) (7, 24) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 23) (5, 15) (23, 0) (23, 10) (23, 5) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (17, 2) (17, 3) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 15) (20, 9) (20, 26) (1, 16) (1, 0) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
The graph described has nodes labeled from 0 to 29 and edges indicated in the provided list. 

Given that there are 30 nodes in total, we can determine which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 11 with 5 neighbors
- Node 2 with 3 neighbors
- Node 16 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors
- Node 9 with 3 neighbors
- Node 27 with 4 neighbors
- Node 29 with 4 neighbors
- Node 5 with 3 neighbors
- Node 10 with 4 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 21 with 4 neighbors
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors
- Node 19 with 3 neighbors
- Node 24 with 4 neighbors
- Node 26 with 3 neighbors
- Node 7 with 3 neighbors
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors
- Node 17 with 2 neighbors (skipped for 3-star calculation as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15 with 3 neighbors
- Node 14 with 2 neighbors (skipped for 3-star calculation as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 45 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 45 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final count is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, (2, 16, 6)>
- <11, (2, 16, 1)>
- <11, (2, 16, 3)>
- <11, (16, 2, 6)>
- <11, (16, 2, 1)>
- <11, (16, 2, 3)>
- <11, (16, 6, 1)>
- <11, (16, 6, 3)>
- <11, (6, 2, 16)>
- <11, (6, 2, 1)>
- <11, (6, 2, 3)>
- <11, (6, 16, 1)>
- <11, (6, 16, 3)>
- <11, (1, 2, 16)>
- <11, (1, 16, 6)>
- <11, (1, 2, 6)>
- <11, (1, 16, 3)>
- <11, (1, 6, 3)>
- <11, (16, 2, 1)>
- <11, (16, 2, 3)>
- <11, (16, 1, 6)>
- <11, (16, 1, 3)>
- <11, (16, 6, 3)>
- <11, (2, 1, 6)>
- <11, (2, 1, 3)>
- <11, (2, 6, 3)>
- <16, (11, 6, 1)>
- <16, (11, 6, 3)>
- <16, (11, 2, 1)>
- <16, (11, 2, 3)>
- <16, (6, 11, 1)>
- <16, (6, 11, 3)>
- <16, (6, 2, 1)>
- <16, (6, 2, 3)>
- <16, (2, 11, 1)>
- <16, (2, 11, 3)>
- <16, (2, 6, 1)>
- <16, (2, 6, 3)>

(Continuing this pattern for the remaining 3-stars...)
