Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 12) (6, 13) (6, 1) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 2) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 17) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 27) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 27) (29, 8) (29, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 20) (1, 22) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 22) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (17, 18) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (20, 13) (20, 19) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 27) (4, 21) (4, 23) (4, 29) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 11) (2, 21) (2, 25) (2, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (14, 7), (16, 7), (24, 23), (11, 0). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (22, 13), (6, 1), (10, 1). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (25, 2), (24, 2), (21, 2). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (23, 4), (29, 4), (21, 4). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (21, 7), (16, 7), (14, 7), (5, 7). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (29, 8), (12, 8), (10, 8). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (8, 10), (14, 10), (5, 10), (1, 10). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (18, 11), (0, 11), (12, 11), (27, 11). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (26, 12), (8, 12), (3, 12), (11, 12). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (22, 13), (21, 13), (20, 13), (6, 13). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (15, 16), (0, 16), (7, 16). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (22, 18), (19, 18), (11, 18), (28, 18), (17, 18). Total 3-stars: [10]
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors: (13, 21), (7, 21), (28, 21), (4, 21), (2, 21). Total 3-stars: [10]
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: (13, 22), (15, 22), (1, 22), (18, 22). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (23, 24), (27, 24), (0, 24), (25, 24). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: (9, 26), (12, 26), (6, 26). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: (23, 27), (28, 27), (11, 27). Total 3-stars: [1]
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: (8, 29), (4, 29), (23, 29). Total 3-stars: [1]

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 30 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (14, 7, 16)>
- <1, (6, 13, 22)>
- <2, (21, 25, 2)>
- <4, (21, 23, 29)>
- <7, (5, 14, 21)>
- <8, (10, 12, 29)>
- <10, (1, 5, 8)>
- <11, (0, 12, 18)>
- <12, (3, 8, 26)>
- <13, (6, 20, 22)>
- <16, (0, 7, 15)>
- <18, (11, 17, 28)>
- <21, (2, 4, 28)>
- <22, (1, 15, 18)>
- <24, (0, 23, 25)>
- <26, (6, 9, 12)>
- <27, (11, 23, 28)>
- <29, (4, 8, 23)>
