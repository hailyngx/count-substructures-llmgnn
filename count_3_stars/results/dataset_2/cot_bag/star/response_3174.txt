Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars with each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighboring nodes: 4, 7, 11, 12
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<0, (4, 7, 11)>, <0, (4, 7, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 12)>, <0, (7, 11, 12)>

Node 1 has 5 neighboring nodes: 2, 5, 7, 9, 14
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 14)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 14)>, <1, (2, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <1, (7, 9, 14)>

Node 4 has 7 neighboring nodes: 0, 2, 6, 7, 12, 14
\[ \binom{7}{3} = 35 \]
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 12)>, <4, (0, 2, 14)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 12)>, <4, (0, 6, 14)>, <4, (0, 7, 12)>, <4, (0, 7, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 14)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 12)>, <4, (2, 6, 14)>, <4, (2, 7, 12)>, <4, (2, 7, 14)>, <4, (2, 12, 14)>, <4, (6, 7, 12)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 12)>, <4, (0, 2, 14)>, <4, (0, 6, 12)>, <4, (0, 6, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 14)>

Node 5 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 2, 8, 13
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 13)>, <5, (1, 8, 13)>, <5, (2, 8, 13)>

Node 6 has 5 neighboring nodes: 2, 4, 8, 11, 12
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 11)>, <6, (2, 4, 12)>, <6, (2, 8, 11)>, <6, (2, 8, 12)>, <6, (2, 11, 12)>, <6, (4, 8, 11)>, <6, (4, 8, 12)>, <6, (4, 11, 12)>, <6, (8, 11, 12)>

Node 7 has 4 neighboring nodes: 4, 0, 1, 11
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 0, 11)>, <7, (4, 1, 11)>, <7, (0, 1, 11)>

Node 8 has 4 neighboring nodes: 5, 6, 9, 11
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 11)>, <8, (5, 9, 11)>, <8, (6, 9, 11)>

Node 11 has 5 neighboring nodes: 0, 6, 7, 8, 12
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<11, (0, 6, 7)>, <11, (0, 6, 8)>, <11, (0, 6, 12)>, <11, (0, 7, 8)>, <11, (0, 7, 12)>, <11, (0, 8, 12)>, <11, (6, 7, 8)>, <11, (6, 7, 12)>, <11, (6, 8, 12)>, <11, (7, 8, 12)>

Node 12 has 5 neighboring nodes: 4, 0, 2, 10, 11
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<12, (4, 0, 2)>, <12, (4, 0, 10)>, <12, (4, 0, 11)>, <12, (4, 2, 10)>, <12, (4, 2, 11)>, <12, (4, 10, 11)>, <12, (0, 2, 10)>, <12, (0, 2, 11)>, <12, (0, 10, 11)>, <12, (2, 10, 11)>

Node 14 has 3 neighboring nodes: 1, 3, 10
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<14, (1, 3, 10)>

Putting the total number of 3-stars together gives us:

\[ [4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [112] \]

So, there are 112 unique 3-stars in this graph.
