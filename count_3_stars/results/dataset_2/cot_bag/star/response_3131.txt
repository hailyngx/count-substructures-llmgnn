Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph to better understand its structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4)

Next, we determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: [5, 8, 7] (Degree: 3)
- Node 1: [9, 8, 7, 2] (Degree: 4)
- Node 2: [9, 6, 4, 7, 1] (Degree: 5)
- Node 3: [6, 4] (Degree: 2)
- Node 4: [9, 6, 3, 2] (Degree: 4)
- Node 5: [9, 8, 0, 7] (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: [7, 3, 2, 4] (Degree: 4)
- Node 7: [5, 6, 8, 0, 2, 1] (Degree: 6)
- Node 8: [5, 0, 1, 7] (Degree: 4)
- Node 9: [5, 4, 2, 1] (Degree: 4)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 2: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 6: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Summing these up: $1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 55$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
<1, (8, 7, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 2, 1)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (8, 0, 1)>
<7, (8, 1, 0)>
