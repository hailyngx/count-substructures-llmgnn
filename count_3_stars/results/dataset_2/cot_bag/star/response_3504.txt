Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7  
Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9  
Node 3: 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8  
Node 5: 2, 8, 9  
Node 6: 1, 3, 4  
Node 7: 0, 1, 9  
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5  
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Summing up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 50 \)

Thus, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<0, (4, 8, 9)>  
<0, (7, 8, 9)>  
<1, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (6, 8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 8)>  
<4, (2, 6, 8)>  
<4, (6, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 5)>  
<8, (3, 4, 5)>  
<8, (4, 5, 9)>  
<8, (0, 5, 9)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
