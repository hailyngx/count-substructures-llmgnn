Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
