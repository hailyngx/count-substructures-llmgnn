Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's list the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
