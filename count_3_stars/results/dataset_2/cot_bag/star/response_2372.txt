Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (2, 0). 
  So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) <0, (6, 4, 5)>, <0, (6, 4, 2)>, <0, (6, 5, 2)>, <0, (4, 5, 2)>.

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (6, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (1, 2), (1, 7).
  So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  <1, (6, 9, 4)>, <1, (6, 9, 2)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>, <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>.

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (6, 2) (4, 2) (1, 2) (7, 2) (0, 2).
  So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  <2, (6, 4, 1)>, <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, <2, (6, 1, 0)>, <2, (4, 1, 7)>, <2, (4, 1, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (1, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 7, 0)>, <2, (1, 7, 0)>.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (9, 3), (8, 3), (5, 3), (3, 5).
  So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  <3, (9, 8, 5)>, <3, (9, 8, 3)>, <3, (9, 5, 3)>, <3, (8, 5, 3)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 4), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0).
  So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  <4, (8, 1, 0)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (1, 0, 2)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32.

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
