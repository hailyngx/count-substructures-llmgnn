Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 11) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 13, 18)>
<2, (12, 13, 17)>
<4, (10, 15, 19)>
<5, (9, 10, 11)>
<6, (11, 14, 18)>
<10, (5, 14, 3)>
<11, (0, 3, 5)>
<12, (2, 16, 19)>
<13, (0, 2, 7)>
<14, (6, 10, 12)>
<16, (8, 12, 18)>
<17, (2, 4, 8)>
<19, (1, 12, 4)>
