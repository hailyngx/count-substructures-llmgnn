Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (6, 16) (6, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 9) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 12) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 18) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 18) (15, 4) (15, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 17.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 15, and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11 and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 13, 16, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 18.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 18, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 15, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 4 and 12.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 12, 14, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 11, and 18.

From the constructed graph above, we can list the 3-stars as follows:

[15]  
<4, (2, 7, 16)>  
<18, (11, 12, 14)>  
<19, (11, 18, 5)>
