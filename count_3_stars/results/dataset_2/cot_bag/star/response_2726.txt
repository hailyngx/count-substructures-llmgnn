Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 45 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 14, 0)>, <5, (8, 11, 12)>, <6, (4, 3, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 10)>, <10, (8, 2, 13)>, <11, (5, 1, 2)>, <12, (5, 14, 1)>, <13, (6, 14, 7)>, <14, (4, 0, 7)>.
