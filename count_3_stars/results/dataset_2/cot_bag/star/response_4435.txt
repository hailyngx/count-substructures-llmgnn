Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19}  
Edges: { (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 11), (9, 18), (9, 2), (14, 18), (14, 4), (10, 11), (10, 16), (11, 8), (11, 15), (8, 13), (8, 19), (13, 16), (6, 7), (6, 0), (2, 4), (2, 0), (19, 3), (19, 12), (15, 12), (7, 3), (16, 7), (18, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (0, 2), (12, 19)}  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 1, 11), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (5, 18, 2), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (5, 10, 8, 15), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (11, 13, 19), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (8, 16, 19), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 0), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (9, 4, 0), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (8, 13, 3, 12), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors (11, 18, 12), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (6, 16, 3), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (10, 13, 7), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors (9, 14, 15, 12, 3), forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (19, 7, 18, 4), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (14, 2, 3), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (19, 15, 18), forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 31  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].
