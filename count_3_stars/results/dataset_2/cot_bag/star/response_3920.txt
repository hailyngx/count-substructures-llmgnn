Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 6)
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (1, 6, 7, 9)
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (0, 4, 7)
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: (1, 3)
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 5, 9)
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 9)
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (5, 7, 9)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
