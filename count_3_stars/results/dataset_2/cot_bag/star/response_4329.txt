Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has neighbors 4, 7, 8, and 12. So it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 12)>, <0, (4, 8, 12)>, <0, (7, 8, 12)>.

For node 1: It has neighbors 2, 3, 5, 6, and 11. So it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 11)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 11)>, <1, (2, 6, 11)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (3, 6, 11)>, <1, (5, 6, 11)>.

For node 2: It has neighbors 1, 8, 9, 13, and 14. So it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 13)>, <2, (1, 8, 14)>, <2, (1, 9, 13)>, <2, (1, 9, 14)>, <2, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (8, 9, 13)>, <2, (8, 9, 14)>, <2, (8, 13, 14)>, <2, (9, 13, 14)>.

For node 3: It has neighbors 1, 5, 9, and 14. So it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 14)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (5, 9, 14)>.

For node 4: It has neighbors 0, 7, and 9. So it can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>.

For node 5: It has neighbors 1, 2, 3, and 14. So it can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 14)>.

For node 6: It has neighbors 1, 8, and 11. So it can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 8, 11)>.

For node 7: It has neighbors 0, 4, 9, and 11. So it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 11)>, <7, (0, 9, 11)>, <7, (4, 9, 11)>.

For node 8: It has neighbors 0, 2, 6, 10, and 11. So it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 10)>, <8, (0, 2, 11)>, <8, (0, 6, 10)>, <8, (0, 6, 11)>, <8, (0, 10, 11)>, <8, (2, 6, 10)>, <8, (2, 6, 11)>, <8, (2, 10, 11)>, <8, (6, 10, 11)>.

For node 9: It has neighbors 3, 4, 7, 12, and 2. So it can form 10 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 12)>, <9, (3, 4, 2)>, <9, (3, 7, 12)>, <9, (3, 7, 2)>, <9, (3, 12, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 12)>, <9, (4, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 12, 2)>, <9, (7, 12, 2)>.

For node 11: It has neighbors 1, 6, 7, 8, and 12. So it can form 10 3-stars: <11, (1, 6, 7)>, <11, (1, 6, 8)>, <11, (1, 6, 12)>, <11, (1, 7, 8)>, <11, (1, 7, 12)>, <11, (1, 8, 12)>, <11, (6, 7, 8)>, <11, (6, 7, 12)>, <11, (6, 8, 12)>, <11, (7, 8, 12)>.

For node 12: It has neighbors 0, 9, 11, and 13. So it can form 1 3-star: <12, (0, 9, 11)>.

For node 13: It has neighbors 2, 10, and 12. So it can form 1 3-star: <13, (2, 10, 12)>.

For node 14: It has neighbors 2, 3, and 5. So it can form 1 3-star: <14, (2, 3, 5)>.

Putting all the unique 3-stars together in <> and counting the number of 3-stars, we get:

\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [47] \]
