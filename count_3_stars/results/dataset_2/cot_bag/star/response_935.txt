Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 5)>
- <0, (1, 7, 2)>
- <1, (0, 6, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (5, 9, 0)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 7)>
- <5, (8, 9, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (4, 9, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
