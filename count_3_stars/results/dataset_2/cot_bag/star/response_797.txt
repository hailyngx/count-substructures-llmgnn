Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. By inspecting the list of edges, we can determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 6
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 6, 3)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (6, 1, 0)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<3, (7, 6, 2)>
<3, (7, 2, 8)>
<3, (6, 2, 1)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<6, (5, 2, 1)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
