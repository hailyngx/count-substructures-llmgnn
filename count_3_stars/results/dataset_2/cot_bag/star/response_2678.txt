Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}  
Edges:  
(0, 3), (0, 18)  
(1, 4), (1, 10), (1, 12)  
(2, 9), (2, 15)  
(3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 11)  
(4, 1), (4, 17), (4, 19)  
(5, 3), (5, 13), (5, 14), (5, 18)  
(6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11)  
(7, 10), (7, 11)  
(8, 6), (8, 12)  
(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 13), (9, 17)  
(10, 1), (10, 7)  
(11, 3), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 13)  
(12, 1), (12, 8), (12, 14), (12, 19)  
(13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 11), (13, 16)  
(14, 5), (14, 12), (14, 15)  
(15, 2), (15, 14), (15, 19)  
(16, 13)  
(17, 4), (17, 9), (17, 18)  
(18, 0), (18, 5), (18, 19), (18, 17)  
(19, 4), (19, 12), (19, 15), (19, 18)  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.  

Since we have 20 nodes, we'll go through each node to see if it forms a 3-star.  

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 1: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 3: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 4: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 5: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 9: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 10: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 11: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 12: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 13: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 14: Forms 3 3-stars  
- Node 15: Forms 3 3-stars  
- Node 16: Forms 1 3-star  
- Node 17: Forms 3 3-stars  
- Node 18: Forms 4 3-stars  
- Node 19: Forms 4 3-stars  

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node gives us a total of 59 3-stars.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].  

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (3, 18)>  
<1, (4, 10, 12)>  
<2, (9, 15, 19)>  
<3, (0, 5, 11)>  
<4, (1, 17, 19)>  
<5, (3, 13, 14)>  
<6, (8, 9, 11)>  
<7, (10, 11, 13)>  
<8, (6, 12, 14)>  
<9, (2, 6, 13)>  
<10, (1, 7, 11)>  
<11, (3, 6, 13)>  
<12, (1, 14, 19)>  
<13, (5, 9, 11)>  
<14, (5, 12, 15)>  
<15, (2, 14, 19)>  
<16, (13)>  
<17, (4, 9, 18)>  
<18, (0, 5, 19)>  
<19, (4, 12, 18)>
