Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 112 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [112].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 13, 14)>
<2, (1, 7, 13)>
<3, (0, 11, 2)>
<4, (6, 10, 12)>
<7, (2, 10, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 10)>
<10, (1, 11, 12)>
<11, (3, 10, 12)>
<12, (1, 9, 11)>
<13, (0, 2, 14)>
<14, (7, 12, 13)>
