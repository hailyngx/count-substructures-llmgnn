Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up these 3-stars gives a total of [34].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 0, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 0, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 1, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>.
