Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 5, 8, 3, 6, 7  
2: 4, 8, 3, 0  
3: 5, 1, 0, 8, 2, 6  
4: 9, 2, 6  
5: 8, 1, 3, 7  
6: 4, 7, 1, 3, 0, 8  
7: 5, 9, 0, 6  
8: 5, 1, 3, 2, 6  
9: 4, 7  

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, node 3 has 6 neighbors, node 6 has 6 neighbors, and node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ \text{Total} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 3-stars in this graph.  
Putting the final number inside brackets: [60]  
Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<1, (5, 3, 6)>,  
<3, (5, 1, 8)>,  
<(4, 9, 7)>,  
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
