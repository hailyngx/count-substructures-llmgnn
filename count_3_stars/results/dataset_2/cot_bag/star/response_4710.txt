Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 55 \).

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 55. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
