Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the graph, let's first count the number of neighbors each node has based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (9, 4, 2)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (7, 12, 6)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (4, 8, 0, 14, 3)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (5, 14, 2)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (5, 8, 13, 0, 2)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (8, 11, 3)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (12, 1, 10, 13)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (11, 14, 1)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (5, 4, 2, 11, 12)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (13, 0)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (14, 1, 6, 13)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (5, 8, 7, 6, 13)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (8, 6, 1)
- Node 13: 5 neighbors (9, 4, 6, 10, 11)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors (7, 3, 2, 10)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 55 3-stars. So, the answer is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 12, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 14)>, <2, (4, 0, 2)>, <2, (8, 0, 2)>, <2, (8, 14, 2)>, <2, (0, 2, 14)>, <2, (14, 2, 3)>, <3, (5, 14, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 13, 4)>, <4, (5, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 4)>, <4, (8, 2, 4)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 2, 14)>, <4, (4, 2, 13)>, <6, (12, 1, 6)>, <6, (12, 6, 13)>, <6, (1, 6, 10)>, <6, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (5, 4, 8)>, <8, (5, 8, 11)>, <8, (4, 8, 2)>, <8, (4, 8, 12)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 14)>, <8, (2, 0, 8)>, <8, (2, 8, 11)>, <8, (2, 8, 12)>, <8, (8, 11, 12)>, <10, (1, 6, 10)>, <10, (6, 10, 13)>, <10, (1, 10, 14)>, <10, (10, 14, 13)>, <11, (5, 8, 11)>, <11, (5, 11, 7)>, <11, (8, 11, 6)>, <11, (8, 11, 13)>, <11, (11, 7, 6)>, <13, (4, 6, 13)>, <13, (6, 13, 10)>, <13, (6, 13, 11)>, <13, (10, 13, 11)>, <13, (10, 13, 4)>, <14, (7, 14, 10)>, <14, (14, 10, 1)>, <14, (14, 10, 13)>.
