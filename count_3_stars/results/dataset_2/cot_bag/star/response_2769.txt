Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up at the end:

1. Node 0: it has neighbors 5, 6, 1, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( 
   \binom{5}{3} = 10\).
   
2. Node 1: it has neighbors 6, 3, 4, 0, 7. So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( 
   \binom{5}{3} = 10\).

3. Node 2: it has neighbors 5, 9, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( 
   \binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   
4. Node 3: it has neighbors 9, 6, 1. So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( 
   \binom{3}{3} = 1\).
   
5. Node 4: it has neighbors 5, 9, 1. So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( 
   \binom{3}{3} = 1\).
   
6. Node 5: it has neighbors 6, 2, 8, 4, 0. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( 
   \binom{5}{3} = 10\).
   
7. Node 6: it has neighbors 5, 1, 3, 0. So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( 
   \binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   
8. Node 7: it has neighbors 9, 1, 0, 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( 
   \binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   
9. Node 9: it has neighbors 4, 2, 3, 7. So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( 
   \binom{4}{3} = 4\).

Adding up all these, we have a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<6, (5, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 0, 2)>
<9, (7, 2, 4)>
