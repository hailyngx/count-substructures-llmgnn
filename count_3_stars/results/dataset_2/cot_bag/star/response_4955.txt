Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
```
      0---2
     /|   | \
    5 |   |  13
     \|   | /
      3---7
        \ | 
          12
```

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 2 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up: \( 35 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 111 \).

Thus, there are 111 total 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this number inside brackets: [111].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 14)>
<9, (2, 11, 13)>
<10, (3, 12, 14)>
<13, (2, 9, 14)>
<14, (4, 7, 9)>
