Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 5) (22, 7) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 11) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (9, 21) (9, 11) (28, 5) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 26) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (26, 22) (26, 8) (26, 14) (26, 17) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 17) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 26) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 23) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 0) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 20) (7, 22) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 20) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (20, 27) (20, 7) (0, 25) (0, 11) (0, 21) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 0) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (10, 8) (10, 27) (24, 29) (24, 12) (23, 2) (23, 17) (23, 0) (23, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify the 3-stars formed by each of them:

1. Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors - 25, 11, 21, 23.
2. Node 2: This node has 3 neighbors - 3, 8, 23.
3. Node 4: This node has 4 neighbors - 1, 6, 12, 13.
4. Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors - 7, 22, 28.
5. Node 6: This node has 3 neighbors - 4, 19, 29.
6. Node 7: This node has 4 neighbors - 5, 19, 20, 22.
7. Node 8: This node has 3 neighbors - 2, 10, 26.
8. Node 11: This node has 3 neighbors - 0, 15, 9.
9. Node 13: This node has 4 neighbors - 22, 14, 4, 27.
10. Node 14: This node has 4 neighbors - 13, 26, 29, 3.
11. Node 17: This node has 3 neighbors - 19, 23, 26.
12. Node 19: This node has 3 neighbors - 6, 17, 7.
13. Node 22: This node has 4 neighbors - 13, 26, 5, 7.
14. Node 23: This node has 4 neighbors - 1, 0, 2, 17.
15. Node 25: This node has 3 neighbors - 12, 0, 27.
16. Node 26: This node has 4 neighbors - 22, 8, 14, 17.
17. Node 27: This node has 4 neighbors - 25, 10, 13, 20.
18. Node 28: This node has 3 neighbors - 5, 18, 22.
19. Node 29: This node has 3 neighbors - 6, 14, 24.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [72]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (25, 11, 21)>
<2, (3, 8, 23)>
<4, (1, 6, 12)>
<5, (7, 22, 28)>
<6, (4, 19, 29)>
<7, (5, 19, 20)>
<8, (2, 10, 26)>
<11, (0, 15, 9)>
<13, (22, 14, 27)>
<14, (13, 26, 29)>
<17, (19, 23, 26)>
<19, (6, 7, 17)>
<22, (5, 7, 28)>
<23, (0, 1, 17)>
<25, (0, 27, 12)>
<26, (8, 14, 17)>
<27, (13, 20, 25)>
<28, (5, 18, 22)>
<29, (6, 14, 24)>
