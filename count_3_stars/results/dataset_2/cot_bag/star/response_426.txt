Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 12, 14.
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 8. 
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the central node: 1

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 9, 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6.
Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 11, 14.
Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8, there are 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 12.
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the central node: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 9, 14.
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9, 14.
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the central node: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 14, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 10.
Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the central node: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Putting it all together:

\( Total = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 41 \)

Therefore, there are 41 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 10, 12)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<10, (3, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 6, 12)>
<0, (1, 3, 14)>
