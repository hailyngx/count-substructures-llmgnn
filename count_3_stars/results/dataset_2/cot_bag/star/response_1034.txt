Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {4, 14}
Node 1: {6, 9, 11, 14}
Node 2: {4, 5, 12, 13}
Node 3: {4, 10, 13}
Node 4: {0, 2, 9, 12, 14, 3}
Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 10}
Node 6: {1, 9}
Node 7: {5, 11, 13}
Node 8: {5, 10, 14}
Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 11, 12}
Node 10: {3, 5, 8, 11, 14}
Node 11: {1, 7, 9, 10, 12}
Node 12: {2, 4, 9, 11, 13}
Node 13: {2, 3, 7, 12}
Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 8, 10}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars:
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Totally, there are [1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 71 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (0, 2, 12)>
<4, (0, 3, 14)>
<4, (2, 5, 12)>
