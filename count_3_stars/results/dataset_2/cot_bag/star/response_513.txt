Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are: 
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 68 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 6, 8)> 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
