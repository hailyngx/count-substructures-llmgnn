Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the 3-stars formed and calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 7, 9, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 8, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 3, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 7, 3, 1}

Now, let's find the 3-stars and their counts:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 4)>, <1, (6, 2, 9)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <1, (6, 7, 4)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 0, 4)>, <7, (6, 0, 4)>, <7, (6, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 1)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
