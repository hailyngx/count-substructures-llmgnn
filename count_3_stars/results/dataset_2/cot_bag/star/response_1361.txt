Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 10) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these numbers up gives a total of 40 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (14, 16, 18)>, <1, (0, 8, 15)>, <3, (7, 9, 15)>, <4, (6, 7, 12)>, 
<6, (4, 13, 19)>, <7, (3, 4, 16)>, <8, (0, 1, 18)>, <9, (3, 6, 17)>, 
<10, (2, 5, 10)>, <14, (0, 13, 16)>, <15, (1, 3, 5)>, <16, (7, 11, 14)>, <18, (0, 8, 17)>.
