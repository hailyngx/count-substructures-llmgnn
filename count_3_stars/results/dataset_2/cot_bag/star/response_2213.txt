Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

We see that nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 14, 2, 8, 13, 10, and 12 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 14: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 71

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 13, 14)>
<7, (6, 9, 11)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (8, 13, 14)>
<14, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 11, 12)>
<8, (1, 10, 14)>
<13, (1, 10, 14)>
<10, (8, 13, 14)>
<12, (2, 8, 13)>
