Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 47 \)

Hence, there are a total of 47 unique 3-stars in this graph. Representing them inside <>:
<0, 1, 3, 16>, <2, 1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 12, 2>, <2, 7, 13, 18>, <3, 1, 12, 2>, <3, 1, 12, 6>, <3, 1, 19, 10>, <3, 6, 12, 2>, <3, 6, 12, 18>, <3, 6, 18, 7>, <6, 3, 12, 2>, <6, 3, 12, 18>, <6, 3, 12, 18>, <6, 5, 12, 3>, <6, 5, 12, 18>, <9, 11, 14, 15>, <9, 11, 13, 19>, <9, 11, 13, 4>, <9, 15, 14, 11>, <9, 15, 14, 15>, <11, 9, 17, 9>, <11, 9, 17, 9>, <11, 9, 17, 9>, <11, 13, 19, 10>, <13, 7, 18, 6>, <13, 7, 16, 18>, <13, 10, 19, 8>, <13, 11, 19, 10>, <13, 11, 19, 4>, <13, 16, 18, 7>, <16, 13, 18, 7>, <16, 13, 18, 6>, <16, 13, 18, 7>, <19, 11, 14, 15>, <19, 11, 14, 15>, <19, 11, 13, 4>, <19, 11, 13, 4>, <19, 13, 10, 8>, <19, 13, 10, 8>, <19, 13, 10, 8>, <19, 13, 4, 0>, <19, 13, 4, 0>
