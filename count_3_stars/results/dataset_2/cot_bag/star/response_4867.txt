Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 13) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 63

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 9, 10)>
<3, (5, 13, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 12)>
<5, (3, 11, 13)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<10, (2, 4, 8)>
<11, (3, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 9, 11)>
<13, (0, 5, 9)>
<14, (3, 4, 12)>
