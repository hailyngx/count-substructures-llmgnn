Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 15) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 10) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 18) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 5, 14, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 16, 9, 4)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 3, 13, 0)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 16, 8, 13, 18)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 14, 13, 12, 7)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 2, 15)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 17, 15, 18)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 8, 12, 15, 7, 6)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 11, 8, 1)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 9, 10, 13)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 7, 2)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 5, 10, 7, 0)

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for each eligible node, we find the following number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 14, 6)>
- <2, (16, 9, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 13)>
- <7, (16, 8, 13)>
- <8, (14, 13, 12)>
- <9, (5, 2, 15)>
- <10, (17, 15, 18)>
- <13, (8, 12, 15)>
- <14, (11, 8, 1)>
- <15, (9, 10, 13)>
- <16, (11, 7, 2)>
- <18, (5, 10, 7)>
