Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 2) (0, 10) (0, 2) (20, 10) (20, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 29) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 4) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 4) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (16, 22) (16, 6) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 7) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 19) (25, 15) (25, 29) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 21) (19, 4) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 7) (7, 24) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 29) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 9) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) (8, 20) (8, 7) (29, 5) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 15, 18, 22, 10, 17, 7, 26, 24, 19, 29, and 12. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 22 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 24 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars formed are: <15, (18, 25, 19)>, <18, (15, 22, 23)>, <22, (18, 26, 16)>, <10, (17, 6, 20)>, <17, (10, 13, 9)>, <7, (24, 1, 11)>, <26, (22, 24, 4)>, <24, (26, 12, 14)>, <19, (15, 27, 21)>, <29, (5, 21, 25)>, <12, (6, 24, 9)>.
