Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The degrees of the nodes are: {0: 5, 1: 5, 2: 5, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 5, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 5, 9: 1}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: It has degree 5, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>

- Node 1: It has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>

- Node 2: It has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 3: It has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>

- Node 4: It has degree 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 5: It has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 0, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>

- Node 6: It has degree 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 7: It has degree 4, so it can form 4 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 8: It has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
   Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 7)>

- Node 9: It has degree 1, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars found: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>,
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>,
