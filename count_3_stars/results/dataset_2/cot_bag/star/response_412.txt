Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, and 8. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have \(10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 57\). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 6)>, <5, (3, 9, 4)>, <5, (3, 9, 7)>, <5, (3, 8, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 4)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (9, 3, 7)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 2, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (9, 7, 8)>, and <8, (5, 3, 4)>.
