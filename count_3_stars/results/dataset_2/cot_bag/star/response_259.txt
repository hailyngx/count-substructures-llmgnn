Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 23) (27, 25) (27, 11) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 13) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 12) (14, 22) (14, 26) (4, 10) (4, 3) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 20) (16, 5) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 15) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 2) (13, 17) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (21, 17) (21, 11) (25, 27) (25, 29) (12, 18) (12, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 11) (6, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 1) (29, 11) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 7) (19, 3) (19, 7) (9, 28) (9, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 19) (20, 16) (10, 4) (10, 1) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 59

So, there are 59 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Putting this number inside brackets: [59]. 

List of unique 3-stars:
