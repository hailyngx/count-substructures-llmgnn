Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first visualize the connections of each node:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 9, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 14.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 10, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, 12, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8, and 11.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 11.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 10.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 86

So, there are a total of 86 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get: [86].

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 5, 10)>, <1, (2, 10, 12)>, <1, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (2, 12, 14)>, <1, (5, 10, 14)>, <2, (6, 8, 14)>, <2, (8, 9, 14)>, <3, (0, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 10, 13)>, <3, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 10)>, <8, (13, 14)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>
