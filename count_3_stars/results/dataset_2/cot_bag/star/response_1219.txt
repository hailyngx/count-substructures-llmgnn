Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (14, 4) (17, 2) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 18) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 16) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (6, 16) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11 and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 12 and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 13, and 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 13, and 15.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11, and 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 16, and 18.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 16.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 14 is connected to node 4.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 15.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 12.
- Node 17 is connected to node 2.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 11.

Now, let's find the 3-stars. 

From the degree list, we see that nodes 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, and 19 have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (4, 9, 13)>
  - <2, (4, 13, 2)>
  - <2, (4, 2, 9)>
  - <2, (13, 5, 2)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (10, 15, 3)>
  - <3, (12, 13, 3)>
  - <3, (13, 5, 3)>
  - <3, (15, 7, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (9, 10, 8)>
  - <8, (9, 11, 8)>
  - <8, (9, 18, 8)>
  - <8, (10, 3, 8)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (2, 18, 9)>
  - <9, (8, 18, 9)>
  - <9, (9, 16, 6)>
  - <9, (9, 18, 8)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <12, (1, 19, 12)>
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <19, (0, 1, 11)>
  - <19, (0, 11, 19)>
  - <19, (1, 12, 19)>
  - <19, (5, 7, 19)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 21 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
