Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 5) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 20) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 21) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 18) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 8) (16, 28) (16, 0) (10, 9) (10, 5) (21, 29) (21, 18) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 8) (12, 23) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 25) (15, 26) (19, 1) (19, 13) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 20) (13, 9) (13, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (8, 20) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 4) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) (24, 28) (24, 13) (24, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 6, 19)>, <1, (3, 6, 27)>, <3, (0, 7, 25)>, <6, (0, 16, 28)>, <22, (5, 26, 27)>, <13, (19, 20, 25)>.
