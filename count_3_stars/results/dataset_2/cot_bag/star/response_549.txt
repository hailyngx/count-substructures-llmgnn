Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 8), (6, 0)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

2. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 13)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20

3. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 12)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 12)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

5. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (10, 1), (10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 2)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

6. Node 11 has 6 neighbors: (11, 9), (11, 3), (11, 10), (11, 13), (11, 12), (11, 2)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20

7. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 10), (4, 8), (4, 13), (4, 14)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

8. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 0)
   Number of 3-stars: 1

9. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 11), (12, 7)
   Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

10. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 8)
    Number of 3-stars: 1

11. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (14, 6), (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 2)
    Number of 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10

12. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (13, 9), (13, 11), (13, 4), (13, 5)
    Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 76.

Unique 3-stars found: <6, (9, 14, 8)>, <9, (6, 2, 11)>, <11, (9, 3, 10)>, <9, (1, 13, 11)>, <11, (3, 12, 10)>, <10, (1, 4, 2)>, <11, (9, 13, 12)>, <14, (6, 4, 7)>, <13, (9, 11, 4)>, <9, (2, 14, 11)>, <3, (1, 0, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 0)>, <6, (8, 4, 0)>, <12, (1, 3, 7)>, <11, (3, 0, 12)>, <14, (7, 2, 5)>, <2, (9, 11, 7)>.
