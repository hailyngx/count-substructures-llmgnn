Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 13) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (18, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes which have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (3, 13, 11)>, <0, (3, 13, 2)>, <0, (3, 11, 2)>, <0, (13, 11, 2)>

Node 2:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (3, 7, 11)>, <2, (3, 7, 0)>, <2, (3, 0, 11)>, <2, (7, 0, 11)>

Node 3:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 13, 2)>, <3, (0, 16, 2)>, <3, (13, 16, 2)>, <3, (0, 13, 16)>

Node 4:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (6, 19, 11)>, <4, (6, 19, 4)>, <4, (6, 11, 4)>, <4, (19, 11, 4)>

Node 6:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<6, (9, 8, 4)>

Node 7:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (2, 13, 19)>, <7, (2, 19, 4)>, <7, (13, 19, 4)>, <7, (2, 13, 4)>

Node 8:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (6, 14, 12)>, <8, (6, 14, 5)>, <8, (6, 12, 5)>, <8, (14, 12, 5)>

Node 9:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<9, (6, 16, 18)>

Node 10:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<10, (14, 5, 15)>

Node 11:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<11, (4, 0, 2)>

Node 12:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<12, (7, 8, 15)>

Node 13:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<13, (7, 5, 0)>, <13, (7, 5, 17)>, <13, (7, 0, 17)>, <13, (5, 0, 17)>

Node 14:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<14, (8, 16, 10)>

Node 16:
- It has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = 1
<16, (3, 9, 14)>

Node 19:
- It has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<19, (1, 7, 4)>, <19, (1, 7, 19)>, <19, (1, 4, 19)>, <19, (7, 4, 19)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4+4+4+4+1+4+4+1+1+1+1+1+4+1+1+1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
