Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The complete list of 3-stars formed in this graph is as follows:

\[ [32] \]
<0, (2, 5, 7)> <2, (0, 3, 8)> <3, (2, 6, 8)> <4, (0, 1, 3)> <6, (3, 6, 8)> <8, (1, 2, 3)> <9, (5, 6, 8)>
