Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 6) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 9) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 18) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (16, 13) (16, 15) (6, 13) (6, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (15, 18, 4)>, <0, (15, 7, 6)>, <0, (15, 16, 12)>, <0, (15, 16, 4)>, <1, (14, 12, 8)>, <2, (17, 7, 0)>, <2, (17, 8, 13)>, <2, (17, 8, 1)>, <2, (19, 5, 18)>, <5, (11, 19, 18)>, <7, (18, 19, 5)>, <8, (17, 13, 9)>, <9, (14, 13, 3)>, <9, (14, 13, 7)>, <13, (16, 15, 6)>, <15, (16, 13, 6)>, <18, (0, 7, 5)>, <18, (0, 7, 19)>, <18, (0, 15, 6)>, <18, (5, 7, 19)>.
