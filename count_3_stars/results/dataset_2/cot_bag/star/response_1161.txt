Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 17) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 18) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 9) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (9, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 7, 12, 2, 19, 4, 0, 10, 16, 11, 8, 5, 6, 18, 14, 1, 13, 17.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (12, 1, 19)>, <7, (12, 1, 11)>, <7, (12, 19, 11)>, <7, (1, 19, 11)>

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (7, 4, 16)>, <12, (7, 16, 19)>, <12, (4, 16, 2)>, <12, (16, 19, 13)>

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (16, 3, 17)>

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<19, (7, 10, 16)>, <19, (10, 16, 13)>, <19, (7, 16, 19)>, <19, (16, 13, 10)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (12, 1, 17)>, <4, (12, 17, 0)>, <4, (1, 17, 11)>, <4, (17, 0, 10)>

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (4, 10, 18)>

Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<10, (19, 0, 9)>

Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<16, (12, 2, 19)>, <16, (12, 19, 13)>, <16, (2, 19, 13)>, <16, (19, 13, 10)>

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<11, (7, 5, 18)>, <11, (7, 18, 17)>, <11, (5, 18, 17)>, <11, (18, 17, 14)>

Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<18, (6, 0, 11)>, <18, (6, 11, 17)>, <18, (0, 11, 14)>, <18, (11, 17, 14)>

Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<14, (8, 1, 18)>

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (7, 14, 13)>, <1, (7, 14, 13)>, <1, (14, 13, 15)>, <1, (13, 15, 16)>

Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<13, (16, 1, 15)>

Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (2, 4, 11)>, <17, (4, 11, 18)>, <17, (11, 18, 14)>, <17, (18, 14, 1)>

There are 32 unique 3-stars in total [32].
