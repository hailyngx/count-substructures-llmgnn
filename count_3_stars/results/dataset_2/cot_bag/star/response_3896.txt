Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (7, 15, 3)>, <1, (7, 15, 12)>, <1, (7, 3, 12)>, <1, (15, 3, 12)>

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (1, 12, 18)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>, <3, (12, 18, 9)>, <3, (18, 11, 14)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (2, 11, 7)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (7, 8, 15)>, <6, (15, 0, 19)>,  <6, (0, 6, 15)>, <6, (8, 15, 6)>

Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<8, (2, 16, 6)>

Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<10, (9, 19, 15)>

Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (13, 18, 4)>, <11, (13, 5, 11)>, <11, (18, 4, 11)>, <11, (11, 14, 18)>

Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<12, (1, 3, 16)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (7, 10, 6)>, <15, (7, 6, 0)>, <15, (10, 6, 15)>, <15, (10, 19, 0)>

Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<18, (3, 9, 19)>, <18, (3, 11, 13)>, <18, (11, 14, 18)>, <18, (9, 19, 0)>

Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<19, (10, 18, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [29].
