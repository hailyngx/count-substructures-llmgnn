Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (8, 16) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 18) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 edges are: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars, we get 38 in total. So, the answer is [38].

Unique 3-stars:

<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 10>
<7, 3, 12>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 4, 10>
<9, 6, 4>
