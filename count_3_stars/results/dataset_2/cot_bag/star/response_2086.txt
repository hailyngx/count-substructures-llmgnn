Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 6, 9, 1, 3, 0, 14, 11, and 13.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 48 \)
So, the total number of 3-stars is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
