Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:  
Node 0: Neighbors {9, 8, 14, 3, 13}  
Node 2: Neighbors {8, 12, 5, 7}  
Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 5}  
Node 5: Neighbors {11, 4, 2, 13}  
Node 6: Neighbors {7, 11, 12, 13}  
Node 7: Neighbors {6, 10, 2, 14, 1}  
Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 0, 12}  
Node 10: Neighbors {9, 11, 7, 1}  
Node 11: Neighbors {6, 9, 10, 3, 13, 5}  
Node 12: Neighbors {6, 8, 2, 1}  
Node 13: Neighbors {6, 11, 0, 5}  
Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Adding all the 3-stars together:  
\(10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 66 \)  

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (8, 9, 14)>, <0, (3, 9, 13)>, <0, (13, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 13, 5)>, <0, (3, 14, 7)>, <2, (8, 7, 12)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 12)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (11, 2, 4)>, <5, (11, 2, 13)>, <6, (7, 12, 13)>, <7, (6, 1, 10)>, <7, (1, 2, 10)>, <10, (1, 11, 7)>, <11, (13, 5, 6)>.
