Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors (9, 8, 6, 7, 3, 0)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 8, 2)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (9, 4, 7, 1)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (5, 4, 7, 0)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (8, 3, 2)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 0)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (5, 6, 0, 3, 2)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 1, 8)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (6, 8, 2, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 60

So, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (8, 9, 6)>
- <0, (8, 1, 5)>
- <0, (8, 1, 2)>
- <0, (8, 4, 3)>
- <2, (9, 4, 3)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 0)>
- <7, (0, 3, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- <8, (9, 1, 0)>
- <8, (9, 1, 5)>
- <8, (9, 6, 0)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 0)>
- <8, (4, 3, 0)>
- <8, (4, 3, 7)>
- <9, (6, 0, 8)>
- <9, (6, 0, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 0)>
- <9, (8, 1, 0)>
- <9, (8, 1, 5)>
