Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 20) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 29) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 19) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 2) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 7) (26, 20) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 17) (6, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 12) (10, 21) (10, 19) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (24, 1) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 28) (2, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 29) (19, 20) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 7) (17, 26) (17, 23) (17, 4) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 17) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (8, 27) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 15, 20, 11, 28, 26, 5, 19, 22, and 25.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

3. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the center.

4. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 20 as the center.

5. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 11 as the center.

6. Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 28 as the center.

7. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 26 as the center.

8. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

9. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 19 as the center.

10. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 22 as the center.

11. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 25 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44  \).

Hence, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (27, 25, 23)>
<3, (1, 5, 22)>
<15, (20, 5, 29)>
<20, (15, 26, 4)>
<11, (0, 28, 2)>
<28, (11, 2, 22)>
<26, (13, 18, 17)>
<5, (3, 15, 18)>
<19, (20, 10, 25)>
<22, (3, 28, 6)>
<25, (0, 27, 26)>
