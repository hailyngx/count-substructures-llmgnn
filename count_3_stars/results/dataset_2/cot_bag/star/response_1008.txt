Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 6
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2

Now, identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 have 5 or more neighbors.

For the calculation:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 has \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 80 \)

Hence, there are 80 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets: [80]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 14>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 11>
