Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 12) (1, 16) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 9) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 2) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 1 neighbor
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up we get a total of 36 3-stars. So, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 14, 13)>, <5, (11, 17, 8)>, <5, (17, 6, 13)>, <5, (17, 7, 13)>, <5, (6, 15, 17)>, <6, (15, 9, 17)>, <6, (15, 10, 17)>, <6, (15, 18, 17)>, <7, (11, 13, 12)>, <8, (5, 17, 9)>, <9, (12, 7, 13)>, <9, (17, 6, 15)>, <9, (17, 6, 10)>, <9, (17, 15, 6)>, <11, (16, 1, 19)>, <11, (16, 1, 7)>, <11, (16, 19, 7)>, <11, (16, 7, 1)>, <11, (7, 1, 16)>, <13, (19, 11, 7)>, <13, (19, 17, 6)>, <13, (19, 14, 11)>, <13, (19, 11, 14)>, <17, (5, 11, 8)>, <17, (5, 11, 8)>, <17, (5, 8, 11)>, <17, (5, 8, 11)>, <17, (6, 15, 9)>, <17, (6, 9, 15)>, <17, (6, 9, 10)>, <17, (6, 10, 9)>, <17, (15, 6, 9)>, <17, (15, 6, 10)>, <17, (15, 10, 6)>, <17, (15, 10, 6)>, <19, (16, 11, 7)>, <19, (16, 13, 3)>, <19, (16, 7, 11)>, <19, (16, 7, 1)>
