Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with it.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it.

Adding up all these, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 93 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [93].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 12, 14)>
- <1, (8, 11, 14)>
- <4, (10, 11, 13)>
- <6, (5, 10, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 13)>
- <10, (4, 12, 13)>
- <11, (1, 5, 8)>
- <12, (0, 4, 10)>
- <13, (4, 9, 14)>
- <14, (0, 8, 13)>
