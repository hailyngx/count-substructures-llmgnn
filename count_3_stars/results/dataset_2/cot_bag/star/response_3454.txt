 - Node 2 is connected to node 6.
 - Node 3 is connected to nodes 18 and 24.
 - Node 4 is connected to node 18.
 - Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 22, 26, and 28.
 - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 24.
 - Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 15, 23, and 25.
 - Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 17, 25, 26, and 27.
 - Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 21, 29.
 - Node 10 is connected to nodes 12, 24, and 26.
 - Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 14.
 - Node 12 is connected to nodes 21, 22, and 27.
 - Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 11, 14, and 17.
 - Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 13.
 - Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 16, 20, and 21.
 - Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 22.
 - Node 17 is connected to nodes 8 and 13.
 - Node 18 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
 - Node 19 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
 - Node 20 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 23.
 - Node 21 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 15.
 - Node 22 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 12, 16, and 29.
 - Node 23 is connected to nodes 7, 20, and 26.
 - Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 10.
 - Node 25 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 18.
 - Node 26 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 10, 23, and 24.
 - Node 27 is connected to nodes 8 and 12.
 - Node 28 is connected to nodes 5 and 29.
 - Node 29 is connected to nodes 9, 22, and 28.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars. Let's start with each node:
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24: Forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars, which we can represent as: [14]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 19, 20>, <1, 20, 22>, <5, 7, 22>, <5, 22, 28>, <7, 14, 15>, <7, 15, 21>, 
<8, 16, 22>, 
<9, 11, 21>, 
<11, 13, 17>, <12, 21, 27>, 
<13, 17, 8>, <16, 15, 22>, 
<18, 3, 4>, 
<20, 15, 23>. 

The final answer is: [14].
