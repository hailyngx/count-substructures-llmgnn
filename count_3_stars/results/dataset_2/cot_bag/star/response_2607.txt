Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: 5, 9, 6, 2, 8, 3 (6 neighbors)
- Node 4: 9, 7, 0, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 6, 2, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 0: 4, 3, 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 6, 0, 2, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 5, 0 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 5, 9, 7, 1 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 5, 7, 6, 1 (4 neighbors)

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ 
<5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 6)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>,
<4, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 8, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 8, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>
\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [60] \).
