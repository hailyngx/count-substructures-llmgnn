Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 81 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [81].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (8, 11, 13)>, 
<1, (5, 11, 12)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (6, 9, 10)>, 
<6, (7, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (5, 12, 1)>, 
<10, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<11, (0, 13, 8)>, 
<11, (1, 12, 8)>, 
<12, (3, 7, 14)>,
<13, (0, 5, 11)>.
