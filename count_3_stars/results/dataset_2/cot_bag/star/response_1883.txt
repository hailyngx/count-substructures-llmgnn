Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 13) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 14) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 7) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 24) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 23) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 27) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 26) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 16) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 11) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 18) (20, 29) (20, 11) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 20) (6, 26) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 10) (24, 15) (24, 13) (24, 16) (11, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 17) (0, 17) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 11) (14, 15) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 25) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (2, 7) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

[Graph of the nodes and edges is shown]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 1 + 4*7 + 10*5 = 1 + 28 + 50 = 79 \)

So, there are [79] 3-stars in total. Now let's list them:

<1, (3, 7, 17)>
<3, (1, 13, 28)>
<5, (7, 17, 21)>
<7, (1, 5, 10)>
<10, (7, 9, 12)>
<12, (13, 21, 25)>
<13, (3, 16, 24)>
<15, (14, 23, 27)>
<16, (2, 10, 24)>
<17, (0, 5, 11)>
<18, (0, 9, 28)>
<20, (11, 21, 29)>
<21, (5, 12, 29)>
<22, (4, 23, 26)>
<24, (15, 16, 13)>
<26, (4, 12, 28)>

<29, (1, 20, 21)>
