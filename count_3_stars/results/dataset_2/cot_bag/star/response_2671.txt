Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>.
