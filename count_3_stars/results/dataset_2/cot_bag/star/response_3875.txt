Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 28) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 8) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (13, 25) (13, 18) (13, 26) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 21) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 21) (21, 24) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 22) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 5) (28, 20) (28, 10) (28, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (29, 15) (29, 18) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 22) (5, 10) (5, 26) (5, 16) (5, 0) (2, 26) (2, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (22, 4) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 8) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 20) (1, 12) (1, 14) (23, 4) (23, 18) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
30 nodes: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29.
90 edges: (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 28) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 8) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (13, 25) (13, 18) (13, 26) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 21) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 21) (21, 24) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 22) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 5) (28, 20) (28, 10) (28, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (29, 15) (29, 18) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 22) (5, 10) (5, 26) (5, 16) (5, 0) (2, 26) (2, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (22, 4) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 8) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 20) (1, 12) (1, 14) (23, 4) (23, 18) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 12)
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: neighbors {22, 23, 16, 3}
- Node 10: neighbors {17, 9, 28, 5}
- Node 13: neighbors {25, 18, 26}
- Node 16: neighbors {4, 28, 22, 5}
- Node 21: neighbors {24, 3, 0, 8, 22}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For nodes 4, 10, 13, 16, 21, which have more than three neighbors, we apply  \[ \binom{n}{3} \] to each:
  - Node 4: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
    - <4, (22, 23, 16)>
    - <4, (22, 23, 3)>
    - <4, (22, 23, 5)>
    - <4, (22, 16, 3)>
    - <4, (22, 16, 5)>
    - <4, (22, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (23, 16, 3)>
    - <4, (23, 16, 5)>
    - <4, (23, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (16, 3, 5)>
  - Node 10: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
    - <10, (17, 9, 28)>
    - <10, (17, 9, 5)>
    - <10, (17, 28, 5)>
    - <10, (9, 28, 5)>
  - Node 13: \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star
    - <13, (25, 18, 26)>
  - Node 16: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
    - <16, (4, 28, 22)>
    - <16, (4, 28, 5)>
    - <16, (4, 22, 5)>
    - <16, (28, 22, 5)>
  - Node 21: \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars
    - <21, (24, 3, 0)>
    - <21, (24, 3, 8)>
    - <21, (24, 3, 22)>
    - <21, (24, 0, 8)>
    - <21, (24, 0, 22)>
    - <21, (24, 8, 22)>
    - <21, (3, 0, 8)>
    - <21, (3, 0, 22)>
    - <21, (3, 8, 22)>
    - <21, (0, 8, 22)>
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 23.

Therefore, there are [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
