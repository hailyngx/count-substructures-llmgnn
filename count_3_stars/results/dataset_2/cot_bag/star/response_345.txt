Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

1. Node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>

2. Node 2:
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 4, 8, 1), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 1)>, <2, (6, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 1)>

3. Node 4:
Node 4 has 6 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 0, 1, 3), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 1)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (6, 8, 3)>, <4, (6, 0, 1)>, <4, (6, 0, 3)>, <4, (6, 1, 3)>, <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>

4. Node 5:
Node 5 has 6 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 3, 7, 5), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 5)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 5)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 5)>, <5, (9, 7, 5)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 5)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 5)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, <5, (3, 7, 5)>

5. Node 6:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 2, 4, 0), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 4, 0)>

6. Node 9:
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 2, 3, 0), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>, <9, (2, 3, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68 3-stars. So, the final answer is [68].
