Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 1) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 11) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {1, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {14, 16, 17}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {13, 15, 17}
- Node 10: {8, 12, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 8, 9, 17}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {1, 9}
- Node 16: {5, 6, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 14, 16}
- Node 19: {16}

Based on the connections, the central nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 13, 17, and 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these central nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (14, 16, 17)>
- <9, (13, 15, 17)>
- <13, (4, 8, 17)>
- <17, (9, 10, 13)>
- <16, (6, 18, 19)>
