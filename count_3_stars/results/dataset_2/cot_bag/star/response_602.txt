Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (3, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 79 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, 8, 1>
- <1, 8, 14>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <1, 4, 14>
- <2, 12, 9>
- <4, 1, 14>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <4, 14, 6>
- <5, 13, 9>
- <7, 8, 10>
- <7, 8, 10>
- <7, 8, 4>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <7, 10, 4>
- <8, 0, 14>
