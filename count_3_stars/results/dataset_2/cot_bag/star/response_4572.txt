Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 4. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- So, there are 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- So, there are 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [4 + 10] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
