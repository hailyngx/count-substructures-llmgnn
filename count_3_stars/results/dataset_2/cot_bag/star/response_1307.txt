Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 49 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [49].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 17, 19)>, <0, (9, 12, 17)>, <0, (12, 13, 15)>, <0, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (7, 14, 18)>, <3, (11, 7, 15)>, <5, (12, 16, 8)>, <6, (16, 9, 19)>, <7, (3, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 16, 6)>, <11, (8, 3, 15)>, <12, (0, 5, 13)>, <14, (1, 13, 19)>, <15, (11, 13, 18)>, <16, (6, 5, 1)>, <18, (15, 2, 9)>, <19, (0, 14, 6)>
