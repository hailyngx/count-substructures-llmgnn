Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (26, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 24) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 21) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 28) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 17) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 19) (16, 7) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 24) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (22, 27) (22, 29) (24, 6) (24, 20) (24, 27) (24, 21) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 28) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 29) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 15, 4, 7, 25, 0, 27, 20, 18, 25, 1, 17, 14, 21, 11, 16, 28, 5, 29, 12, and 24. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they belong to: \( \binom{k}{3} \) where k is the degree of the node.

Let's calculate them: 

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 45 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<6, 9, 14>, 
<9, 8, 15>, 
<15, 8, 0>, 
<4, 7, 18>, 
<7, 4, 16>, 
<20, 24, 25>, 
<0, 15, 27>, 
<27, 0, 24>, 
<8, 9, 15>, 
<15, 8, 11>, 
<23, 5, 14>, 
<10, 17, 21>, 
<17, 10, 1>, 
<21, 10, 24>, 
<11, 19, 28>, 
<28, 19, 16>, 
<5, 7, 12>, 
<22, 27, 29>.
