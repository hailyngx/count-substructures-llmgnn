Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8 have 4 neighbors
- Node 4, 6, 7, 9 have 3 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 58 \)

So, the final answer is: [58]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
