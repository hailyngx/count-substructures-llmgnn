Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.  

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula discussed earlier:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 96

So, there are 96 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 11>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 14>
<1, 9, 14>
<2, 7, 10>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 11>
<3, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 13>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 12>
<4, 5, 11>
<5, 11, 13>
<7, 8, 10>
<8, 9, 14>
<11, 4, 5>
<11, 4, 12> 

So, there are 22 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [22].
