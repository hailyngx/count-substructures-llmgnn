Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 17) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 13) (5, 17) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 4) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 1) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 0) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 12) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <0, (3, 15, 19)>  <0, (3, 8, 19)>  <0, (15, 8, 19)>  <0, (15, 18, 19)>
- Node 2: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <2, (11, 19, 18)>  <2, (11, 8, 19)>  <2, (11, 9, 19)>  <2, (9, 11, 19)>
- Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <7, (13, 18, 19)>  <7, (13, 18, 7)>  <7, (13, 18, 1)>  <7, (13, 18, 12)>
- Node 8: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
    - <8, (2, 16, 0)>  <8, (2, 16, 12)>  <8, (2, 16, 15)>  <8, (2, 16, 8)>  <8, (10, 1, 18)>  <8, (10, 3, 0)>  <8, (10, 3, 15)>  <8, (10, 3, 8)>  <8, (10, 1, 6)>  <8, (10, 1, 18)>
- Node 10: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <10, (1, 3, 15)>  <10, (1, 3, 8)>  <10, (1, 3, 0)>  <10, (1, 18, 7)>
- Node 11: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <11, (15, 14, 2)>  <11, (15, 14, 5)>  <11, (2, 9, 19)>  <11, (2, 9, 14)>
- Node 15: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
    - <15, (11, 14, 5)>  <15, (11, 14, 2)>  <15, (11, 9, 14)>  <15, (11, 9, 2)>
- Node 18: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
    - <18, (7, 13, 19)>  <18, (7, 13, 12)>  <18, (1, 6, 10)>  <18, (1, 6, 8)>  <18, (1, 6, 0)>  <18, (1, 6, 12)>  <18, (1, 6, 16)>  <18, (1, 6, 2)>  <18, (1, 6, 9)>  <18, (1, 6, 11)>
- Node 19: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
    - <19, (7, 13, 18)>  <19, (7, 13, 12)>  <19, (0, 15, 3)>  <19, (0, 15, 8)>  <19, (0, 15, 18)>  <19, (0, 3, 10)>  <19, (0, 3, 15)>  <19, (0, 3, 8)>  <19, (0, 3, 18)>  <19, (0, 8, 10)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [54].
