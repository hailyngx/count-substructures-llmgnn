Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [binom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
- Node 1: [binom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
- Node 2: [binom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
- Node 3: [binom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
- Node 4: [binom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
- Node 5: [binom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
- Node 7: [binom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
- Node 8: [binom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
- Node 9: [binom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [51].
