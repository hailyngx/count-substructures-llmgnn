Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 9, 4, 8, 7
- Node 1: 6, 3, 2, 4
- Node 2: 6, 1, 7
- Node 3: 5, 1, 7, 8, 4
- Node 4: 9, 6, 1, 3, 8, 0
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5, 3, 8, 2, 0
- Node 8: 3, 4, 0, 7
- Node 9: 4, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 each have 5 neighbors.
Node 2, 6 each have 3 neighbors.

For nodes with 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 7), each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Thus, we have \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) 3-stars from these nodes.

For nodes with 3 neighbors (2, 6), each can form 1 3-star. Thus, we have \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) 3-stars from these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [50 + 2] = 52 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (5, 8, 7)>
- <1, (6, 3, 4)>
