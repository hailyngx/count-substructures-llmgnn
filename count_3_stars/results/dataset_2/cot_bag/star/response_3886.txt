Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 8)  
Node 2: (2, 13), (2, 18), (2, 0)  
Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 19), (3, 18)    
Node 4: (4, 19), (4, 17), (4, 10)    
Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 19), (5, 12), (5, 10)  
Node 6: (6, 11), (6, 5), (6, 14)  
Node 8: (8, 16), (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 15)  
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 10)  
Node 10: (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 4), (10, 9)  
Node 11: (11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 6), (11, 15)  
Node 15: (15, 11), (15, 8), (15, 18), (15, 14), (15, 9)  
Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 8)  
Node 18: (18, 3), (18, 2), (18, 19), (18, 15)  
Node 19: (19, 3), (19, 18), (19, 5), (19, 4)  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars  
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star  
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 39  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].  
The unique 3-stars are:
