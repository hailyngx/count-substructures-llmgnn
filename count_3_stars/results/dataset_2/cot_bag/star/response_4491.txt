Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)
Final answer: [46]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>
