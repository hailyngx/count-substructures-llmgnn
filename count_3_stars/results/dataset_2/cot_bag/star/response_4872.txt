Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 6 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
