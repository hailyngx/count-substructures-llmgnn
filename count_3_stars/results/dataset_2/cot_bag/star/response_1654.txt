Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (23, 5) (23, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 26) (27, 2) (27, 20) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 10) (28, 2) (28, 20) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 14) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 8) (14, 23) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 12) (26, 14) (26, 21) (21, 14) (21, 26) (0, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 25) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (15, 0) (15, 17) (13, 16) (13, 12) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 3) (10, 28) (10, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
(11, 16), (11, 28), (11, 18), (11, 4), (16, 11), (16, 24), (16, 13), (16, 19), (6, 9), (6, 25), (6, 8), (9, 6), (9, 1), (22, 28), (22, 24), (23, 5), (23, 14), (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 26), (27, 2), (27, 20), (7, 12), (7, 5), (7, 1), (28, 11), (28, 22), (28, 10), (28, 2), (28, 20), (20, 27), (20, 28), (20, 29), (20, 18), (29, 20), (29, 0), (29, 14), (8, 6), (8, 19), (8, 3), (19, 16), (19, 8), (14, 23), (14, 29), (14, 26), (14, 21), (26, 12), (26, 14), (26, 21), (21, 14), (21, 26), (0, 29), (0, 3), (0, 15), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 10), (3, 18), (5, 23), (5, 7), (5, 0), (5, 1), (24, 16), (24, 22), (24, 25), (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 5), (2, 27), (2, 28), (2, 25), (15, 0), (15, 17), (13, 16), (13, 12), (25, 6), (25, 24), (25, 2), (18, 11), (18, 20), (18, 3), (10, 28), (10, 3), (17, 15), (17, 4), (4, 11), (4, 0), (4, 17)

Now we'll find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node.

Central Node: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 17)>, <0, (3, 5, 15)>, <0, (3, 15, 17)>, <0, (4, 5, 15)>, <0, (4, 5, 17)>, <0, (5, 15, 17)>, <0, (15, 17, 4)>, <0, (15, 17, 5)>, <0, (5, 7, 23)>, 

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
