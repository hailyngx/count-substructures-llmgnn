Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, and 6. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (9, 7, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, and 6. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 3, 6)>, <2, (9, 3, 6)>

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<3, (9, 6, 2)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>

4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 0, and 1. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>

5. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 8, 4, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

<5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>

6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 0, and 2. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 2)>, <6, (3, 0, 2)>, <6, (8, 0, 2)>

7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 0, 1, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

<7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 1)>, <7, (5, 0, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>

8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 3, and 6. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<8, (5, 7, 3)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (7, 3, 6)>

9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 3, and 0. So, the number of 3-stars involving node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

<9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (2, 3, 0)>

Adding up all the cases, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [42].
