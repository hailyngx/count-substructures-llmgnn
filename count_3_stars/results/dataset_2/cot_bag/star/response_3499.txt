Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 2, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 2, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 0, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 38, which can be represented as [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
In total, there are 7 unique 3-stars.
