Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 8 and node 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 10, and 1.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (4, 14, 10)>, <8, (4, 14, 1)>, <8, (4, 10, 1)>, <8, (14, 10, 1)>

2. Node 10:
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 3, 6, and 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (8, 11, 3)>, <10, (8, 11, 6)>, <10, (8, 11, 9)>, <10, (8, 3, 6)>, <10, (8, 3, 9)>, <10, (8, 6, 9)>, <10, (11, 3, 6)>, <10, (11, 3, 9)>, <10, (11, 6, 9)>, <10, (3, 6, 9)>

Since we've found all the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors, we now sum up the total: 4 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 10) = 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
