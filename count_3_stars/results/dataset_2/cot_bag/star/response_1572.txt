Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, we will construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The graph will look like this:  

```
    0 --- 5 --- 1
     \         /
       \     /
         9
         |
         6
        / \
      4 --- 7 --- 3
       \       /
        \   /
          8
          |
          2
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, and 8. Hence, it forms 1 3-star. So far, the total count is [1].
  - <2, (4, 3, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 9, 1, and 4. Hence, it forms 1 3-star. Now, the total count is [2].
  - <5, (0, 9, 1)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 1, and 2. Hence, it forms 1 3-star. The count is [3].
  - <6, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, and 2. Hence, it forms 1 3-star. The count is [4].
  - <8, (4, 7, 3)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 0, and 1. Hence, it forms 1 3-star. The count is [5].
  - <9, (5, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. Thus, the final answer is [5].
