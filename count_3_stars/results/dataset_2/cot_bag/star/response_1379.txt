Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now we will find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 5:
    - Neighbors: {1, 4, 9}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>

2. For node 9:
    - Neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>

3. For node 6:
    - Neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>

4. For node 4:
    - Neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 8}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>

5. For node 8:
    - Neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 9}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>

6. For node 3:
    - Neighbors: {4, 6, 7}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>

7. For node 7:
    - Neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars found in the graph is 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 40 which means there are 40 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
