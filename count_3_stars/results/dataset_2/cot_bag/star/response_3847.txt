Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 48

Thus, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (7, 8, 1)>
<2, (9, 6, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (3, 1, 4)>
<8, (4, 1, 0)>
