Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
We'll start by representing the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: 
- 0: {11, 13}
- 1: {5, 7, 12}
- 2: {9}
- 3: {6, 8, 9}
- 4: {8, 13}
- 5: {1, 6, 14, 17}
- 6: {3, 5, 8, 12}
- 7: {1, 17, 19}
- 8: {3, 4, 6, 18}
- 9: {2, 3, 16, 19}
- 10: {13, 18}
- 11: {0, 16}
- 12: {1, 6, 18}
- 13: {0, 4, 10}
- 14: {5, 15, 18}
- 15: {14}
- 16: {9, 11, 17, 18}
- 17: {5, 7, 16, 19}
- 18: {8, 10, 12, 14, 16}
- 19: {7, 9, 17}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 35 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars found are: <5, (1, 6, 17)>, <6, (3, 5, 12)>, <7, (1, 17, 19)>, <8, (3, 6, 18)>, <9, (3, 9, 16)>, <12, (1, 6, 18)>, <14, (5, 15, 18)>, <16, (9, 16, 17)>, <17, (5, 7, 19)>, <18, (8, 10, 14)>
