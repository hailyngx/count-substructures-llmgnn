Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 2) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 29) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 26) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 13) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 22) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 23) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 20) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 25) (27, 10) (16, 7) (16, 20) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 23) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 0) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 29) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 22) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 12) (23, 24) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating how many 3-stars are formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
18. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
19. Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 4 \times 19 = 76 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [76].

Unique 3-stars found: <1, 21, 12>, <2, 8, 24>, <6, 9, 2>, <7, 21, 16>, <9, 6, 25>, <10, 18, 3>, <12, 1, 21>, <14, 23, 19>, <15, 28, 11>, <18, 12, 4>, <20, 2, 16>, <22, 15, 8>, <23, 24, 12>, <26, 3, 7>, <28, 15, 11>, <29, 22, 8>
