Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 37 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (12, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 1, 2)>, <4, (10, 3, 4)>, <7, (8, 10, 7)>, <8, (0, 12, 8)>, <10, (4, 7, 10)>, <11, (19, 17, 11)>, <12, (16, 3, 12)>, <16, (15, 14, 16)>, <17, (19, 11, 17)>.
