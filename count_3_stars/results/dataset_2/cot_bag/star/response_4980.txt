Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 14. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8, 13), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 12, 13), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 8, 11, 12, 14), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 6, 9, 11, 14), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 10:
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 9, 14), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Node 11:
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7, 13), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 13:
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 11), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Node 14:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 10), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
