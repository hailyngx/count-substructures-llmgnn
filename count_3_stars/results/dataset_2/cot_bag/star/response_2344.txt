Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 9) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 18) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 27) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 24) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (26, 17) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 13) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (25, 24) (27, 1) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 3) (24, 7) (24, 23) (24, 25) (24, 6) (17, 26) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 19) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 29) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 2) (29, 14) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (18, 21) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 19) (13, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 20: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 5 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 7: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 20: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 22: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 23: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 24: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 26: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 28: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$

Adding these up: $1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 35, as shown inside the brackets: [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
