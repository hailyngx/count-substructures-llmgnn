Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 16) (15, 10) (15, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 19) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0 with 4 neighbors, node 3 with 5 neighbors, and node 9 with 5 neighbors. 

For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 10, 18)>
- <0, (3, 9, 19)>
- <0, (10, 9, 19)>
- <0, (9, 19, 18)>

For node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars:
- <3, (1, 6, 13)>
- <3, (1, 4, 13)>
- <3, (1, 13, 7)>
- <3, (6, 4, 13)>
- <3, (6, 13, 7)>
- <3, (4, 13, 7)>
- <3, (10, 6, 13)>
- <3, (10, 4, 13)>
- <3, (10, 13, 7)>
- <3, (6, 4, 7)>

For node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars:
- <9, (8, 16, 19)>
- <9, (8, 0, 17)>
- <9, (8, 19, 17)>
- <9, (16, 0, 19)>
- <9, (16, 19, 4)>
- <9, (0, 19, 4)>
- <9, (16, 19, 17)>
- <9, (0, 4, 19)>
- <9, (0, 19, 17)>
- <9, (4, 19, 17)>

There are in total 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [24].
