Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 74 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 74 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets []: {74}
