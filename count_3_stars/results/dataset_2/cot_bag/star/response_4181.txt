Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 14, 17, 25, 2, 18, 8, 19, 26, 5, 13, 3, 10, 15, 24, 1, 0, 4, 12, 22, 28, 23, 7, 6, 21, 29, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these totals: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 61\)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 3, 7)>
<14, (17, 6, 13)>
<17, (14, 24, 2)>
<25, (20, 15, 24)>
<2, (17, 8, 19)>
<8, (2, 5, 21)>
<19, (2, 4, 26)>
<26, (8, 19, 23)>
<5, (8, 19, 13)>
<15, (25, 7, 21)>
<24, (17, 25, 9)>
<1, (0, 13, 24)>
<12, (20, 5, 22)>
<3, (11, 16, 5)>
<7, (11, 9, 15)>
<21, (8, 27, 4)>
<29, (11, 23, 0)>
<10, (18, 3, 16)>
<4, (19, 21, 28)>
<6, (14, 7, 23)>
