Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are two nodes with less than 3 neighbors: nodes 1 and 5. Node 1 has only 1 edge and node 5 has 2 edges, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 4. So, node 0 can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 13, and 14. So, node 6 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 9, and 3. So, node 7 can form 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 13, 12, and 14. So, node 10 can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 8, 3, 12, and 14. So, node 11 can form 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 13, and 0. So, node 2 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 7, 13, 0, 11, and 12. So, node 3 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 9, 7, 0, 2, and 14. So, node 4 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 13, 14, 11, 6, and 8. So, node 8 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 2, and 7. So, node 9 can form 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, and 10. So, node 12 can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 8, 2, 3, 10, and 6. So, node 13 can form 6 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 6, 11, and 10. So, node 14 can form 6 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 6 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 10) + 4 (from node 11) + 6 (from node 2) + 6 (from node 3) + 6 (from node 4) + 6 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 12) + 6 (from node 13) + 6 (from node 14) = 57.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
