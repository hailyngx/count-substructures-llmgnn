Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 11) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 24) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 10) (13, 7) (13, 26) (13, 1) (26, 12) (26, 5) (26, 13) (4, 15) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 15) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 23) (29, 22) (29, 3) (2, 23) (2, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 25) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 8) (10, 28) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 25) (11, 21) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 8) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 24) (14, 3) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 15) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 20) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 22) (25, 10) (8, 0) (8, 18) (8, 17) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- From node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- From node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- From node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- From node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- From node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- From node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- From node 25: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing these up, we have a total of 36 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

Some unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 10)>
- <3, (0, 10, 29)>
- <5, (6, 26, 18)>
- <6, (5, 10, 28)>
- <10, (0, 25, 28)>
- <12, (15, 16, 25)>
- <25, (6, 10, 12)>
