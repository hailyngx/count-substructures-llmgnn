Response:
Based on the given information, we can draw the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 29 and the edges are as described.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 14, 19, 29. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <6, (0, 14, 19)>, <6, (0, 14, 29)>, <6, (0, 19, 29)>, <6, (14, 19, 29)>
  
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 13, 21, 27, 29. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <8, (13, 21, 27)>, <8, (13, 21, 29)>, <8, (13, 27, 29)>, <8, (21, 27, 29)>
  
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: nodes 12, 17, 18, 23. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <10, (12, 17, 23)>, <10, (12, 18, 23)>, <10, (12, 17, 18)>, <10, (17, 18, 23)>
  
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 15, 28, 10. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <12, (2, 15, 28)>, <12, (2, 15, 10)>, <12, (2, 28, 10)>, <12, (15, 28, 10)>
  
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 8, 11. So, it forms 1 3-star.
  
  <13, (3, 8, 11)>
  
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 17, 12. So, it forms 1 3-star.
  
  <15, (3, 17, 12)>
  
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: nodes 10, 11, 15, 27. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <17, (10, 15, 27)>, <17, (10, 11, 27)>, <17, (10, 11, 15)>, <17, (15, 11, 27)>
  
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 10, 24, 27. So, it forms \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
  <18, (1, 10, 24)>, <18, (1, 10, 27)>, <18, (1, 24, 27)>, <18, (10, 24, 27)>
  
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: nodes 2, 7, 21, 23, 25. So, it forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  
  <22, (2, 7, 21)>, <22, (2, 7, 23)>, <22, (2, 7, 25)>, <22, (2, 21, 23)>, <22, (2, 21, 25)>, <22, (2, 23, 25)>, <22, (7, 21, 23)>, <22, (7, 21, 25)>, <22, (7, 23, 25)>, <22, (21, 23, 25)>

In total, there are 35 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [35].
