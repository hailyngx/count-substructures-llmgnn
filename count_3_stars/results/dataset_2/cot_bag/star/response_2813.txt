Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 8) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 4) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 22) (27, 29) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 26) (7, 22) (7, 12) (7, 20) (29, 27) (29, 1) (29, 6) (21, 28) (21, 20) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 20) (16, 3) (16, 23) (16, 28) (16, 13) (18, 10) (26, 14) (26, 8) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 2) (2, 12) (2, 25) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 20) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 24) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 0) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 0) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 4) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors where we can form 3-stars. Let's list them:

1. Node 3:
   - <3, (14, 17, 15)>
   - <3, (14, 17, 10)>
   - Total: [2]

2. Node 8:
   - <8, (5, 17, 26)>
   - <8, (17, 23, 26)>
   - Total: [2]

3. Node 12:
   - <12, (7, 2, 6)>
   - Total: [1]

4. Node 14:
   - <14, (17, 3, 26)>
   - Total: [1]

5. Node 16:
   - <16, (3, 23, 13)>
   - Total: [1]

6. Node 22:
   - <22, (17, 23, 27)>
   - Total: [1]

7. Node 24:
   - <24, (15, 11, 0)>
   - Total: [1]

8. Node 28:
   - <28, (21, 1, 25)>
   - Total: [1]

9. Node 29:
   - <29, (27, 1, 6)>
   - Total: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed from each node, we get a total of [11].
