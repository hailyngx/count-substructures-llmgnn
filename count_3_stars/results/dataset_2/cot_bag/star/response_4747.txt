Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 52

Thus, there are 52 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
[<1, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 12, 13>, <6, 2, 18>, <6, 4, 13>, <10, 7, 11>, <11, 5, 18>, <11, 7, 14>, <11, 9, 5>, <11, 19, 8>, <13, 0, 15>, <13, 1, 18>, <13, 4, 6>, <13, 6, 2>, <14, 3, 7>, <16, 3, 6>, <18, 1, 2>, <19, 0, 15>, <19, 8, 13>] 

Thus, there are 52 3-stars in the graph, and the list of unique 3-stars is [<1, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 11, 5>, <3, 12, 13>, <6, 2, 18>, <6, 4, 13>, <10, 7, 11>, <11, 5, 18>, <11, 7, 14>, <11, 9, 5>, <11, 19, 8>, <13, 0, 15>, <13, 1, 18>, <13, 4, 6>, <13, 6, 2>, <14, 3, 7>, <16, 3, 6>, <18, 1, 2>, <19, 0, 15>, <19, 8, 13>].
