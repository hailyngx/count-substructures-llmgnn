Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 4. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 0, 7, 13. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 14, 4. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 14, 13, 12. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 10, 11, 2, 0. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 13, 12, 0, 7. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, 2. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 8, 5, 0, 14. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 12, 7. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 13. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 13. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 10, 12, 4. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 3, 11, 8, 5, 14. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 10, 5, 14. So, there are [1] 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 3, 2, 13, 7, 12. So, there are [1] 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 13>
<2, 6, 14>
<3, 6, 13>
<4, 10, 11>
<5, 0, 7>
<6, 2, 9>
<7, 1, 14>
<8, 9, 12>
<10, 4, 13>
<11, 4, 12>
<12, 5, 14>
<13, 3, 14>
