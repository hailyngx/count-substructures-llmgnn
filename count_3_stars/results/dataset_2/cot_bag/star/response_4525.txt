Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (12, 27) (12, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 17) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 7) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 7) (3, 2) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 18) (10, 1) (10, 7) (15, 19) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (20, 21) (20, 8) (29, 23) (29, 14) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 19) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 6) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 25) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 26) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (24, 0) (24, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 16) (8, 6) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 24) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 9) (14, 29) (14, 13) 

Response:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 27, 28, 24, 26, 2
Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 0, 12, 11
Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 27, 16
Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 17
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 0, 25, 7
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 18, 14, 23
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 17, 2, 10, 8
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 22, 1, 19, 7
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 16, 20, 8, 18
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 4
Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 27, 23, 4
Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, 29
Node 20 has 2 neighbors: 21, 8
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 23, 14, 4
Node 28 has 2 neighbors: 0, 19
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 16
Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 12, 21, 2, 8, 5
Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 9, 21, 6
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 22, 11, 29
Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 17, 15, 28, 25
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 18, 7, 8
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 26, 17, 10, 6
Node 24 has 2 neighbors: 0, 25
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 21, 20, 16, 6
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 26, 19, 24
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 9, 29, 13
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 22, 16
Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 14, 29

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Summing these up:

\[ 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 61 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 61, which we put inside brackets: [61].
