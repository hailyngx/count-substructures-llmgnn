Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the respective edges are:
1: (4, 1), (2, 1), (8, 1), (0, 1)
2: (6, 2), (8, 2), (1, 2), (5, 2)
3: (6, 3), (8, 3), (0, 3), (5, 3)
4: (7, 4), (9, 4), (6, 4), (1, 4)
5: (2, 5), (3, 5), (0, 5)
6: (4, 6), (9, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)
7: (4, 7), (9, 7), (1, 7), (8, 7)
8: (7, 8), (9, 8), (2, 8), (0, 8)
9: (4, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9)
0: (8, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0)

There are 7 nodes with 4 or more neighbours: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 0
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding all these up, we have 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
