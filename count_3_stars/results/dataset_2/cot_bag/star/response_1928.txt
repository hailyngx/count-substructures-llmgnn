Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 9, 4, 6, 2
Node 1: 5, 7, 6, 8
Node 2: 9, 4, 6, 0
Node 3: 9, 6
Node 4: 7, 8, 0, 6, 2
Node 5: 9, 8, 1
Node 6: 4, 1, 3, 2, 0
Node 7: 4, 1, 8
Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1
Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 3, 0

Calculating for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4C3 = 4 3-stars: <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>, <0, (9, 6, 2)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>
Node 1 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 4)>, <1, (6, 7, 4)>
Node 4 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10 3-stars: <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (7, 1, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>
Node 6 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 0, 4)>, <6, (2, 0, 4)>, <6, (2, 0, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 8 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10 3-stars: <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 1)>, <8, (7, 5, 1)>, <8, (7, 1, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 9 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 5C3 = 10 3-stars: <9, (8, 5, 1)>, <9, (8, 5, 2)>, <9, (8, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (7, 4, 6)>, <9, (7, 6, 3)>

The final number of 3-stars formed by the nodes in this graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 38.
