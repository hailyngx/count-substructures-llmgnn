Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 13) (4, 22) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 8) (29, 27) (29, 3) (29, 19) (6, 3) (6, 28) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 16) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 20) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 11) (25, 27) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 16) (22, 4) (22, 20) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 20) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 24) (5, 7) (5, 2) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 21) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 8) (23, 18) (23, 0) (9, 4) (19, 29) (19, 24) (19, 16) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 18) (0, 23) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 20) (20, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 8) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 12) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (21, 14) (21, 24) (21, 11) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors: 6, 18, 23, 25
- Node 3 with neighbors: 1, 6, 24, 29
- Node 6 with neighbors: 0, 3, 12, 16, 28
- Node 7 with neighbors: 5, 15, 17
- Node 10 with neighbors: 18, 20, 26
- Node 11 with neighbors: 12, 13, 21
- Node 12 with neighbors: 6, 11, 15
- Node 13 with neighbors: 11, 16, 17, 27
- Node 15 with neighbors: 7, 12, 28
- Node 16 with neighbors: 6, 13, 19, 26
- Node 17 with neighbors: 7, 13, 8
- Node 18 with neighbors: 0, 8, 10, 23
- Node 20 with neighbors: 8, 10, 22, 28
- Node 21 with neighbors: 11, 14, 24
- Node 24 with neighbors: 2, 3, 19, 21, 29
- Node 26 with neighbors: 10, 16, 14
- Node 28 with neighbors: 15, 20, 6
- Node 29 with neighbors: 3, 19, 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star
- Node 29 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 50 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 6, 23, 25>, <0, 6, 18, 23>, <0, 6, 18, 25>, <0, 18, 23, 25>, <3, 6, 24, 29>, <3, 6, 19, 24>, <3, 6, 16, 24>, <3, 6, 16, 19>, <3, 6, 16, 26>, <3, 24, 21, 29>, <6, 12, 11, 28>, <6, 12, 11, 15>, <6, 12, 15, 28>, <6, 16, 19, 26>, <7, 17, 8>, <10, 18, 20>, <11, 12, 21>, <13, 11, 16, 27>, <15, 12, 28>, <16, 13, 17, 27>, <18, 8, 20, 23>, <20, 28, 22>, <24, 19, 21, 29>, <26, 10, 14>, <29, 19, 27>
