Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 5) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 26) (7, 24) (7, 1) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 25) (17, 6) (17, 23) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 26) (11, 21) (28, 3) (28, 25) (5, 27) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 6) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 5) (15, 16) (8, 12) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 10) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 6) (3, 27) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 10) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 23) (20, 26) (26, 0) (26, 12) (26, 29) (26, 20) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 23) (9, 2) (9, 14) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 19) (16, 4) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 16) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ \binom{10}{3} = 120 \text{ from node 5} \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \text{ from node 16} \]
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \text{ from node 24} \]

Therefore the total number of 3-stars is \(120 + 20 + 20 = 160 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get: \[ [160] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-star formations:
<5, (27, 0, 21)>
<16, (4, 25, 13)>
<16, (1, 10, 16)>
<24, (7, 1, 3)>
