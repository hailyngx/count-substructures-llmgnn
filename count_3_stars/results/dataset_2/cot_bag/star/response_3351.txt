Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3, node 9, and node 12.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 6, 13, 16, and 2.
- Total number of 3-stars formed around node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars around node 3: <3, (6, 13, 16)>, <3, (6, 13, 2)>, <3, (6, 16, 2)>, <3, (13, 16, 2)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: nodes 17, 5, 11, 10, and 17.
- Total number of 3-stars formed around node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars around node 9: <9, (17, 5, 11)>, <9, (17, 5, 10)>, <9, (17, 5, 10)>, <9, (17, 11, 10)>, <9, (5, 11, 10)>, <9, (17, 11, 10)>, <9, (5, 11, 10)>, <9, (17, 5, 11)>, <9, (17, 5, 10)>, <9, (5, 11, 10)>.

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: nodes 15, 4, 2, and 11.
- Total number of 3-stars formed around node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars around node 12: <12, (15, 4, 2)>, <12, (15, 4, 11)>, <12, (15, 2, 11)>, <12, (4, 2, 11)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4] = 18 \).
