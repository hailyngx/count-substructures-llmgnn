The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 9) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 13) (2, 27) (2, 8) (29, 17) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 13) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 28) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 20) (4, 1) (4, 28) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 7) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 25) (9, 0) (9, 29) (9, 22) (9, 12) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 5) (13, 16) (19, 27) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 3) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 23) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 7) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 10) (15, 14) (3, 5) (3, 26) (7, 8) (7, 24) (16, 29) (16, 13) (16, 23) (11, 0) (11, 24) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 20) (14, 5) (14, 15) (20, 6) (20, 23) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: {15, 11, 9}
- Node 1: {21, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {27, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 26}
- Node 4: {1, 28}
- Node 5: {13, 25, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {28, 15, 12, 20}
- Node 7: {8, 24}
- Node 8: {2, 25, 17, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 29, 22, 12}
- Node 10: {21, 18, 22, 15}
- Node 11: {0, 24}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 13: {27, 29, 5, 16}
- Node 14: {5, 15}
- Node 15: {0, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 16: {29, 13, 23}
- Node 17: {29, 8, 23}
- Node 18: {10}
- Node 19: {27, 28, 26, 23}
- Node 20: {6, 23}
- Node 21: {1, 10}
- Node 22: {9, 10}
- Node 23: {19, 17, 16, 20}
- Node 24: {26, 11, 7}
- Node 25: {5, 8, 28}
- Node 26: {19, 24, 3}
- Node 27: {2, 19, 13}
- Node 28: {6, 4, 19, 25}
- Node 29: {17, 13, 9, 16}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by applying the formula and then list the unique 3-stars formed: 

- Node 0: [2]
- Node 1: [<1, (4, 12, 21)>]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [<4, (1, 28, 21)>]
- Node 5: [<5, (13, 14, 25)>]
- Node 6: [<6, (12, 15, 28)>]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [<9, (12, 29, 22)>]
- Node 10: [<10, (15, 18, 21)>]
- Node 11: [0]
- Node 12: [<12, (1, 6, 9)>]
- Node 13: [<13, (5, 16, 27)>]
- Node 14: [0]
- Node 15: [<15, (10, 14, 6)>]
- Node 16: [<16, (13, 23, 29)>]
- Node 17: [<17, (8, 23, 29)>]
- Node 18: [0]
- Node 19: [<19, (26, 27, 28)>]
- Node 20: [0]
- Node 21: [<21, (1, 10, 4)>]
- Node 22: [0]
- Node 23: [<23, (16, 19, 20)>]
- Node 24: [0]
- Node 25: [0]
- Node 26: [0]
- Node 27: [0]
- Node 28: [0]
- Node 29: [<29, (9, 16, 17)>]

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars formed in this graph.
