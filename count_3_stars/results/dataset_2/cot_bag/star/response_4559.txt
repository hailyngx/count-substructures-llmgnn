Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 1 has 5 neighbors, node 2 has 5 neighbors, node 4 has 5 neighbors, node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 7 has 4 neighbors, node 8 has 4 neighbors, node 9 has 4 neighbors, node 10 has 4 neighbors, node 11 has 4 neighbors, and node 12 has 5 neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 10, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- For node 12, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 66 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (7, 8, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (8, 10, 11)>, <1, (7, 11, 12)>, <1, (5, 11, 13)>, <1, (7, 10, 13)>, <1, (7, 11, 13)>, <1, (5, 11, 14)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 11, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 11)>, <2, (4, 10, 12)>, <2, (4, 11, 13)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 10)>, <4, (0, 9, 12)>, <4, (0, 9, 13)>, <4, (5, 9, 10)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 13)>, <5, (0, 4, 13)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 13)>, <7, (0, 5, 13)>, <10, (1, 6, 10)>
