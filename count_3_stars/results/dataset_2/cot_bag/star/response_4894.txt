Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

We will now determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node:

- Node 0 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-stars. (Only 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>
