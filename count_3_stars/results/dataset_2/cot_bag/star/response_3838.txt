Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 3) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (1, 13) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 16) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 15) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 12) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 15) (11, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 12, 18)>, <4, (2, 12, 18)>, <9, (8, 16, 17)>, <10, (1, 13, 15)>, <12, (2, 16, 18)>, <13, (1, 10, 19)>, <15, (7, 16, 19)>, <16, (4, 9, 12)>, <18, (2, 4, 16)>, <19, (3, 13, 15)>
