Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph (nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11). We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 91 \]

Therefore, there are 91 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 12, 14)>, <2, (0, 9, 13)>, (4, 3, 12), (5, 6, 7), <6, (0, 4, 10)>, <11, (4, 6, 13)> \]
