Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 3: [3, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>]
- Node 5: [5, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>]
- Node 6: [6, <6, (1, 3, 9)>]
- Node 7: [7, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10. 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have [10].
