Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 19) (21, 15) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (19, 2) (19, 28) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 20) (20, 5) (20, 9) (4, 13) (4, 27) (4, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 7) (11, 9) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 2) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (1, 28) (14, 27) (14, 16) (9, 20) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 9) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 3 (with 3 neighbors), 5 (with 5 neighbors), 7 (with 5 neighbors), and 12 (with 4 neighbors).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25.

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
