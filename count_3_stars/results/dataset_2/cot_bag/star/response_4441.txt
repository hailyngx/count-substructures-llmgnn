Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (14, 3) (14, 27) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 23) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 29) (21, 24) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 12) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 19) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 22) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 22) (18, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 6) (8, 22) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 16) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 23) (27, 14) (27, 16) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 24) (6, 26) (6, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 25, 28, 19, 17, 12, 21, 29, 8, 13, 16, 22, 11, 3, 24, and 27.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} ] = [ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 ] = [122] \]

Therefore, there are 122 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 19, 18)>, <5, (9, 19, 28)>, <5, (9, 19, 15)>, <5, (9, 19, 8)>, <9, (5, 28, 13)>, <9, (5, 28, 20)>, <9, (5, 28, 26)>, <9, (5, 28, 24)>, <25, (17, 20, 23)>, <25, (17, 20, 12)>, <25, (17, 20, 13)>, <25, (20, 17, 12)>, <25, (20, 17, 13)>, <25, (20, 17, 23)>, <25, (20, 17, 12)>, <25, (20, 17, 13)>, <25, (20, 17, 23)>, <28, (5, 0, 13)>, <28, (5, 0, 26)>, <28, (5, 0, 19)>, <28, (5, 0, 26)>, <19, (5, 0, 22)>, <19, (5, 0, 8)>, <12, (7, 25, 22)>, <12, (7, 25, 8)>, <12, (7, 25, 22)>, <21, (7, 29, 24)>, <21, (7, 29, 24)>
