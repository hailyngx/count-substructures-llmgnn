Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 6, 4, 5, and 1.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [22] \).

The unique 3-stars are:  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>  
<5, (0, 6, 8)>  
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
