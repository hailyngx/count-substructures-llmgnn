This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 8) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (20, 7) (20, 19) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 25) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 5) (8, 11) (19, 3) (19, 20) (4, 2) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 23) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 9) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 15) (28, 27) (28, 4) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 15) (22, 7) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 10) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 6) (13, 1) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 5) (5, 8) (5, 21) (16, 2) (16, 22) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 13) (14, 1) (23, 18) (23, 9) (12, 3) (12, 17) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 23) (10, 3) (10, 24) (29, 22) (29, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (27, 21, 24)>, <0, (27, 21, 9)>, <0, (21, 24, 9)>, <0, (27, 24, 9)>.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (26, 14, 13)>.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <2, (26, 16, 4)>, <2, (26, 16, 22)>, <2, (26, 4, 28)>, <2, (4, 28, 27)>.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (10, 19, 12)>.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (20, 25, 6)>, <7, (20, 25, 22)>, <7, (20, 25, 9)>, <7, (20, 6, 22)>, <7, (20, 6, 9)>, <7, (20, 22, 9)>, <7, (25, 6, 22)>, <7, (25, 6, 9)>, <7, (25, 22, 9)>, <7, (6, 22, 9)>.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <8, (27, 5, 11)>.

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <13, (1, 21, 29)>, <13, (1, 21, 6)>, <13, (1, 29, 6)>, <13, (21, 29, 6)>.

Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <15, (26, 25, 17)>, <15, (26, 25, 6)>, <15, (26, 17, 6)>, <15, (25, 17, 6)>.

Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <21, (0, 11, 5)>, <21, (0, 11, 13)>, <21, (0, 5, 13)>, <21, (11, 5, 13)>.

Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <22, (7, 16, 6)>, <22, (7, 16, 29)>, <22, (16, 6, 29)>, <22, (7, 6, 29)>.

Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <24, (0, 27, 11)>, <24, (0, 27, 10)>, <24, (0, 11, 10)>, <24, (27, 11, 10)>.

Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <25, (26, 7, 17)>, <25, (26, 7, 15)>, <25, (26, 17, 15)>, <25, (7, 17, 15)>.

Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <26, (1, 2, 15)>, <26, (1, 2, 25)>, <26, (1, 15, 25)>, <26, (2, 15, 25)>.

Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <27, (0, 8, 24)>, <27, (0, 8, 18)>, <27, (0, 8, 28)>, <27, (0, 24, 18)>, <27, (0, 24, 10)>, <27, (0, 18, 28)>, <27, (8, 24, 18)>, <27, (8, 24, 28)>, <27, (8, 18, 28)>, <27, (24, 18, 28)>.

Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

There are a total of 45 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
This final number 45 goes inside brackets: [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
