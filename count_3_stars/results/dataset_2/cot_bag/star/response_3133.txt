Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 75  

So, there are a total of 75 3-stars in the graph.  
Putting this number inside brackets: [75]  

The list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<1, (6, 8, 11)>  
<4, (8, 9, 10)>  
<6, (1, 5, 12)>  
<8, (1, 4, 10)>  
<10, (0, 4, 14)>  
<11, (1, 4, 7)>  
<12, (6, 7, 13)>  
<13, (6, 12, 14)>  
<14, (1, 10, 13)>  
<0, (10, 12, 2)>
