Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We will count the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes.

1. For node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

2. For node 1: It also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. For node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. For node 3: It has 3 neighbors, which is exactly 3, so it can form 1 3-star.

5. For node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. For node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

7. For node 6: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

8. For node 7: It has 3 neighbors, which is exactly 3, so it can form 1 3-star.

9. For node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

10. For node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 62 \) 3-stars.  

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
