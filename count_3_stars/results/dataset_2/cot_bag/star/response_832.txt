Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 4) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 24) (6, 17) (6, 10) (3, 21) (3, 10) (25, 15) (25, 0) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 12) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 21) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 28) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 15) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 7) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 2) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 23) (4, 26) (4, 22) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 23) (12, 19) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 13) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 13) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors; it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors; it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors; it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 each have 3 neighbors; each can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up:
1 + 4 + 4 + 16 + 17 = 42

Hence, there are a total of 42 3-stars in the graph. 

Putting this inside brackets: [42]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 21, 3>
<5, 9, 20>
<8, 1, 26>
<9, 26, 1>
<10, 18, 27>
<14, 16, 24>
<16, 17, 6>
<17, 8, 1>
<18, 20, 2>
<19, 14, 27>
<20, 9, 27>
<22, 23, 12>
<23, 11, 5>
<24, 16, 7>
<25, 0, 15>
<26, 1, 4>
<27, 18, 10>
<28, 15, 29>
<29, 2, 5>
