Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Each of the 10 nodes has the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 7, 1)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (9, 6, 4, 2, 0)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (9, 4, 7, 8, 1)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (7, 8, 0, 1, 2)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (9, 6, 0, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (5, 1, 8, 0)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (5, 4, 0, 2)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (6, 4, 2)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 2, 3, 1)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)> 

So, the final result is [56].
