Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 10) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 4) (18, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (12, 18, 0)>
<4, (2, 6, 4)>
<5, (13, 17, 5)>
<10, (1, 9, 10)>
<13, (11, 15, 13)>
<15, (0, 6, 15)>
<16, (0, 10, 16)>
<17, (5, 13, 17)>
<19, (1, 5, 19)>
