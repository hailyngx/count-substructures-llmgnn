Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 11) (15, 1) (15, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 19) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars formed.

First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 47.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 12, 18)>, <2, (7, 17, 11)>, <5, (7, 10, 19)>, <7, (2, 11, 17)>, <9, (6, 12, 19)>, <11, (4, 7, 14)>, <14, (11, 16, 17)>
