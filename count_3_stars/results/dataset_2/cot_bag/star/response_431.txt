Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 19) (15, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 28) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 4) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (28, 10) (28, 12) (29, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 18) (17, 23) (17, 20) (17, 26) (2, 13) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 25) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 9) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 27) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 26) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (0, 9) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 27) (25, 10) (25, 16) (25, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 25) (6, 13) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three neighbors: node 10, node 11, and node 14. 

For node 10, we have the edges (10, 15), (10, 11), (10, 28), (10, 25). This node forms 1 3-star.

For node 11, we have the edges (11, 10), (11, 24), (11, 1), (11, 4). This node forms 1 3-star.

For node 14, we have the edges (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 4), (14, 12), (14, 13). This node forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<10, (15, 11, 28)>
<11, (10, 24, 1)>
<14, (21, 22, 4)>
