Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 2)>, 
  <0, (1, 8, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 0)>, <0, (2, 7, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 4)>, 
  <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 0)>, <0, (4, 8, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 0)>,
  <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <0, (6, 4, 1)>, <0, (3, 1, 0)>,
  <0, (5, 1, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (9, 7, 5)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 0)>,
  <1, (2, 3, 0)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>,
  <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (8, 4, 0)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2, (0, 3, 1)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>,
  <2, (1, 7, 0)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 0, 2)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>,
  <2, (6, 7, 0)>, <2, (8, 4, 0)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <4, (0, 8, 1)>, <4, (0, 6, 2)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 0)>,
  <4, (6, 0, 2)>, <4, (3, 0, 4)>, <4, (8, 0, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 0)>,
  <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>,
  <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 0)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>,
  <7, (1, 2, 0)>, <7, (6, 2, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60.
Therefore, the final result is [60].
