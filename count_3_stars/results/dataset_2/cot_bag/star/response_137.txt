Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 2: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 3: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 4: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 5: 3-stars = [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 6: 3-stars = [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 8: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 9: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 10: 3-stars = [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 11: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 13: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 14: 3-stars = [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 3>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 4, 10>
<14, 9, 11>
<14, 9, 8>
<14, 9, 13>
<14, 11, 5>
<14, 11, 3>
<14, 11, 10>
<14, 13, 2>
<14, 13, 4>
<14, 13, 11>
