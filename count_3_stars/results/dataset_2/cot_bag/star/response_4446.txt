Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 7) (3, 16) (3, 27) (3, 22) (15, 19) (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 13) (13, 27) (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 3) (22, 13) (22, 14) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 11) (16, 6) (2, 18) (2, 10) (29, 8) (29, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 23) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 23) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 8) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 14) (5, 28) (5, 8) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 10) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 23) (10, 21) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 14) (17, 11) (17, 21) (17, 25) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 17) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (8, 5) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors 16, 27, 22, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors 16, 18, 1, 4, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors 26, 24, 23, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has neighbors 2, 1, 23, 21, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has neighbors 22, 28, 24, 21, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has neighbors 9, 3, 11, 6, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has neighbors 11, 21, 25, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has neighbors 15, 0, 4, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has neighbors 9, 26, 7, 14, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has neighbors 13, 17, 29, 25, so it can form 3-stars.
- Node 26 has neighbors 9, 24, 27, 7, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has neighbors 26, 3, 0, 13, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has neighbors 12, 14, 5, 24, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has neighbors 8, 25, so it can form no 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars identified, we have a total of 12 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (16, 27, 22)>
<6, (16, 18, 1)>
<7, (26, 24, 23)>
<10, (2, 1, 23)>
<14, (22, 28, 24)>
<16, (9, 3, 11)>
<17, (11, 21, 25)>
<19, (15, 0, 4)>
<24, (9, 26, 7)>
<25, (13, 17, 29)>
<26, (9, 24, 27)>
<27, (26, 3, 0)>
<28, (12, 14, 5)>
