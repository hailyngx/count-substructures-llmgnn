Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 12) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (16, 8) (16, 13) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with exactly three neighbors are 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [\binom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [\binom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [\binom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 9: [\binom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 15: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 16: [\binom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (10, 14, 5)>
- <1, (11, 12, 18)>
- <1, (11, 12, 15)>
- <1, (14, 2, 7)>
- <1, (14, 2, 12)>
- <1, (14, 7, 2)>
