Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up all these, we have a total of \(10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60\) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 0, 6)>
