Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 

Letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 17, 19)>, 
<1, (5, 7, 10)>, 
<2, (0, 6, 15)>, 
<3, (4, 14, 18)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 18)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 11, 17)>, 
<7, (1, 8, 18)>, 
<8, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (10, 14, 19)>, 
<10, (1, 9, 19)>, 
<14, (3, 9, 19)>, 
<16, (7, 12, 17)>, 
<17, (0, 6, 16)>, 
<18, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<19, (0, 9, 10)>.
