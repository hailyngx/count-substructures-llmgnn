Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) 

Response:
We first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: {(4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 14), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 5), (6, 9), (6, 14), (6, 10), (9, 6), (9, 3), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 14), (8, 11), (13, 1), (10, 11), (10, 1), (11, 3), (5, 8), (12, 3), (3, 14), (0, 2), (14, 2)}

Now let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (7, 12, 0, 5, 14) => inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars <4, (7, 12, 0)>, <4, (7, 12, 5)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 14)>, <4, (7, 5, 14)>, <4, (12, 0, 5)>, <4, (12, 0, 14)>, <4, (12, 5, 14)>, <4, (0, 5, 14)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4, 12, 0, 9, 5) => inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars <7, (4, 12, 0)>, <7, (4, 12, 9)>, <7, (4, 12, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 9)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <7, (12, 0, 9)>, <7, (12, 0, 5)>, <7, (12, 9, 5)>, <7, (0, 9, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
