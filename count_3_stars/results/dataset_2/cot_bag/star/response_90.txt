Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 2) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 1) (5, 9) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 1) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 21) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 1) (26, 22) (26, 29) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 19) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (1, 22) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 2) (23, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 19) (18, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 12) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 56 \)

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 20, 21)>
<1, (2, 28, 29)>
<2, (7, 17, 29)>
<6, (3, 11, 28)>
<9, (0, 14, 24)>
<14, (9, 12, 16)>
<15, (25, 27, 28)>
<16, (13, 3, 14)>
<17, (2, 8, 12)>
<20, (0, 1, 25)>
<21, (0, 19, 27)>
<22, (1, 26, 29)>
<24, (3, 9, 19)>
<25, (15, 17, 20)>
<27, (15, 21, 29)>
<28, (6, 15, 25)>
<29, (7, 8, 27)> 

So, the final answer is [56].
