- Node 20 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and 29
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 15, 12, and 4
- Node 27 is connected to node 16
- Node 5 is connected to node 17
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 16, 25, and 11
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 17 and 20

Now, let's list the 3-stars formed in this graph:

[29]  
<9, (6, 15, 23)>  
<26, (0, 3, 9)>  
<3, (4, 18, 23)>  
<15, (1, 21, 29)>  
<6, (9, 15, 21)>  
<10, (14, 17, 28)>  
<17, (2, 10, 13)>  
<21, (6, 10, 15)>  
<1, (15, 16, 29)>  
<16, (1, 28, 27)>  
<28, (16, 25, 10)>  
<13, (17, 23, 13)>  
<8, (19, 24, 9)>  
<19, (4, 8, 9)>  
<25, (0, 22, 28)>  
<0, (25, 26, 0)>  
<11, (14, 22, 19)>  
<14, (10, 20, 11)>  
<23, (3, 9, 13)>  
<7, (11, 18, 7)>  
<24, (3, 8, 24)>  
<18, (3, 7, 23)>  
<20, (2, 14, 20)>  
<4, (3, 19, 29)>  
<27, (16, 27)>  
<5, (17, 5)>  
<22, (11, 25, 16)>  
<2, (17, 20)>    

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
