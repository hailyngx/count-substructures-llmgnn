Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 19, 9
- Node 1: 14
- Node 2: 11
- Node 3: 7, 11, 16
- Node 4: 7, 0
- Node 5: 18, 17
- Node 6: 7, 8, 19, 17
- Node 7: 4, 3, 13, 6
- Node 8: 13, 19, 17, 6
- Node 9: 0, 16
- Node 10: 13, 11
- Node 11: 3, 13, 10, 14, 2
- Node 12: 15
- Node 13: 7, 8, 16, 11, 10
- Node 14: 1, 11, 18, 15
- Node 15: 18, 14, 12
- Node 16: 3, 13, 17, 9
- Node 17: 8, 6, 16, 5
- Node 18: 5, 14, 15
- Node 19: 8, 0, 6

Now, let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars formed:

1. Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (4, 0, 13)>, <7, (3, 13, 6)>, <7, (3, 13, 11)>, <7, (6, 8, 19)>
2. Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (13, 19, 17)>, <8, (13, 17, 6)>, <8, (19, 0, 6)>, <8, (6, 17, 16)>
3. Node 13 forms inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars: <13, (7, 16, 11)>, <13, (7, 16, 10)>, <13, (7, 11, 10)>, <13, (7, 11, 14)>, <13, (8, 19, 17)>, <13, (8, 19, 6)>, <13, (8, 17, 6)>, <13, (19, 0, 6)>, <13, (11, 10, 14)>, <13, (16, 17, 9)>
4. Node 16 forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars: <16, (13, 17, 9)>, <16, (3, 17, 9)>, <16, (13, 17, 5)>, <16, (17, 5, 18)>

Adding up the 3-stars from all relevant nodes gives us a total of [4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 22 unique 3-stars.
