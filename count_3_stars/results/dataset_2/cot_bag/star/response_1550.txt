Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
This graph has one node with 6 neighbors and one node with 5 neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars:

For the node with 6 neighbors:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
There are 20 3-stars centered at this node.

For the node with 5 neighbors:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 3-stars centered at this node.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (0, 9, 14)>
<13, (1, 6, 7)>
