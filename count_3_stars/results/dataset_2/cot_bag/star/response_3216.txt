Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 2) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 13) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 29) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 17) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 25) (29, 21) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 11) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 5) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 13) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 18) (8, 0) (8, 24) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 22) (28, 7) (7, 9) (7, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 27, 0, 1, 21, 26, 17, 29, 10, 5, 19, 6, 4, 22, 25, 16, 24, 2, 20, 8, 9, 12, 13, 11, 7, 18, and 23.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars.

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<15, (3, 27, 1)>, 
<27, (15, 0, 21)>, 
<0, (27, 21, 8)>, 
<1, (15, 26, 6)>,
