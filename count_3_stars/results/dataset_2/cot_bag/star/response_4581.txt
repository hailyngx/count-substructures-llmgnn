Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes (1, 3, 7, 0, and 5) that have three or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of 20 3-stars.

Putting these unique 3-stars inside <>:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 1)>, <5, (0, 6, 4)>, <5, (8, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (7, 6, 4)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
