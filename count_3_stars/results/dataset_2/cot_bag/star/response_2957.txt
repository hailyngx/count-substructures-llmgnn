Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 9) (8, 19) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 1) (0, 7) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 6) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 1) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 2 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Counting the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (14, 10, 19)>, 
<4, (18, 6, 15)>, 
<5, (13, 16, 6)>, 
<6, (4, 18, 15)>, 
<9, (2, 16, 11)>, 
<11, (4, 9, 19)>, 
<13, (17, 5, 6)>, 
<19, (12, 1, 11)>.
