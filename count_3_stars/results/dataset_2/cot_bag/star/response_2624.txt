Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 11) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 17, 8, 13, 18.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 10, 13, 2.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 3, 15, 7, 2, 14.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 15, 8, 19, 5.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 6, 15, 10, 16.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 10, 5, 14, 11.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: ${{4}\choose{3}} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 3: ${{4}\choose{3}} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 10: ${{5}\choose{3}} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 11: ${{4}\choose{3}} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 14: ${{4}\choose{3}} = 4$ 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is $4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26$. Hence, the final answer is $[26]$.

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (8, 13, 18)>
- <3, (1, 10, 2)>
- <10, (15, 7, 14)>
- <11, (15, 8, 19)>
- <14, (6, 15, 16)>
