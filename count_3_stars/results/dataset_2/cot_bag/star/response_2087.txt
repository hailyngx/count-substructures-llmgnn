Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (14, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 13) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (11, 18) (11, 9) (11, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 18, 0, 2, 6, 12, 7, 11, 15, 13, 10.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, gives $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, gives $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, gives $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 6 neighbors, gives $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, gives $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, gives $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, gives $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, gives $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, gives $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, gives $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, gives $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, gives $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $ 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 70 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
