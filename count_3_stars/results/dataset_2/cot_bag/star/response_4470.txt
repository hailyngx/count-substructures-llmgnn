Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 10, 5, 8, 13, 14, 2, 3, 1, 0, and 7.   

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).  
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).  
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).  
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is 1.  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).    
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 101 \)   

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [101].
