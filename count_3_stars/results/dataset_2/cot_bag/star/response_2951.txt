Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 14) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 19) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 1 neighbor
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 7: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 14: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 16: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 19: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

Adding them up: $4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 35$

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 5, 7, 18>, <0, 5, 10, 14>, <0, 5, 17, 19>, <3, 4, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9, 14>, <5, 7, 15, 16>, <6, 7, 15, 16>, <7, 15, 16, 18>, <9, 14, 16, 18>, <0, 12, 13, 19>, <1, 2, 13, 19>, <4, 10, 14, 16>, <5, 7, 10, 14>, <5, 10, 14, 16>, <5, 19, 1, 8>, <6, 16, 11, 14>, <7, 15, 16, 11>, <11, 16, 8, 19>, <11, 16, 14, 10>, <15, 16, 8, 19>
So, the final count is [35].
