- Node 27: 9, 24
- Node 28: 21, 13, 10
- Node 29: 20, 17, 1

Let's check each node to see how many 3-star graphs can be formed:

- Node 0: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 2: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 10: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 11: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [34].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 12, 18)>, <0, (2, 15, 18)>, <0, (3, 12, 18)>, <0, (3, 15, 18)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 15, 25)>, <4, (7, 9, 25)>, <4, (7, 19, 25)>, <4, (19, 25, 26)>, <7, (15, 25, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 27)>, <11, (16, 21, 25)>, <11, (16, 26, 21)>, <11, (20, 21, 29)>, <11, (20, 26, 29)>
