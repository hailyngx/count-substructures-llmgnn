Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 1: 2, 7, 10, 14
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 10, 14
- Node 3: 7, 10
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 12
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8, 14
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 10
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7
- Node 10: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 11: 0, 4, 12, 13
- Node 12: 5, 11, 13
- Node 13: 0, 11, 12
- Node 14: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: 1 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: 1 3-star
- For Node 7: 1 3-star
- For Node 10: 1 3-star
- For Node 11: 1 3-star
- For Node 14: 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars found, we have: \[ [56 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [82] \]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (8, 12, 13)>
- <1, (2, 10, 14)>
- <2, (1, 6, 10)>
- <4, (6, 11, 14)>
- <6, (2, 4, 14)>
- <7, (1, 9, 14)>
- <10, (1, 2, 8)>
- <11, (0, 12, 13)>
- <14, (0, 1, 2)>
