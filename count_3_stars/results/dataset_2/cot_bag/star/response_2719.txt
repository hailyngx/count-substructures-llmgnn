Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 9: neighbors {6, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 11: neighbors {2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 13: neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 87

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [87].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 13)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 12, 13)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (6, 10, 11)>
<11, (7, 9, 13)>
<12, (3, 7, 8)>
<13, (1, 7, 8)>
<14, (1, 13, 4)>
