Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 13, 8, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 9, 4, and 2.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 13)>, <3, (1, 10, 14)>, <10, (1, 3, 11)>, <13, (1, 8, 12)>, <8, (3, 13, 9)>, <5, (8, 6, 12)>, <12, (13, 5, 12)>, <14, (3, 11, 5)>, <9, (10, 8, 7)>, <4, (13, 6, 14)>, <2, (10, 3, 11)>
