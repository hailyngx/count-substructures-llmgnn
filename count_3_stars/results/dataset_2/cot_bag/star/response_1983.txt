Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0, 1, and 2. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 47 [47].
