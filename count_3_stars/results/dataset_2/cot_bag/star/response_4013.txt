Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
The graph described has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

1: 15, 11, 14, 5
2: 3, 15, 9, 12
3: 2
4: 15, 7
5: 10, 1, 16, 14
6: 9, 11, 8, 0
7: 4, 10, 14
8: 6, 18
9: 6, 2, 19
10: 7, 11, 5
11: 6, 10, 1, 12
12: 15, 11, 2
13: 16, 14
14: 7, 1, 13, 18, 5
15: 1, 12, 4, 2
16: 13, 0, 5
17: 18
18: 8, 17, 19, 14
19: 9, 18

Now, we'll go through each node to find the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4
<1, (15, 5, 14)> <1, (11, 5, 14)> <1, (15, 11, 12)> <1, (15, 11, 14)>

Node 2: [4 choose 3] = 4
<2, (3, 9, 12)> <2, (3, 9, 15)> <2, (9, 12, 15)> <2, (12, 15, 2)>

Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
<6, (9, 11, 8)> <6, (9, 11, 0)> <6, (9, 11, 6)> <6, (11, 8, 6)>

Node 9: [3 choose 3] = 1
<9, (6, 2, 19)>

Node 10: [3 choose 3] = 1
<10, (7, 11, 5)>

Node 11: [4 choose 3] = 4
<11, (6, 10, 1)> <11, (6, 10, 5)> <11, (1, 12, 11)> <11, (12, 2, 11)>

Node 14: [5 choose 3] = 10
<14, (7, 13, 18)> <14, (7, 5, 18)> <14, (7, 13, 14)> <14, (7, 5, 14)> <14, (13, 16, 14)>
<14, (13, 18, 14)> <14, (16, 5, 14)> <14, (18, 19, 14)> <14, (18, 5, 14)> <14, (18, 13, 14)>

Node 15: [4 choose 3] = 4
<15, (1, 12, 15)> <15, (1, 4, 15)> <15, (1, 2, 15)> <15, (12, 2, 15)>

Node 18: [4 choose 3] = 4
<18, (8, 17, 19)> <18, (8, 14, 18)> <18, (8, 17, 18)> <18, (17, 19, 18)>

There are in total [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 32 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [32].
