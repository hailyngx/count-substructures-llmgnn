Response:
Given the edges provided, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 17, and 9.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 26, and 21.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 29, 5, and 15.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 17, 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 17, 13, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 20.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 22, 9, and 23.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 21, 24, and 28.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 26, 21.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 25, 18, and 23.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 29, 11, 1, and 6.
- Node 16 is connected to node 28.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 27, 16, 7, and 10.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 22, 23.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 19, 20, and 8.
- Node 15 is connected to node 17.
- Node 2 is connected to node 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 24, 14, and 23.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 28, 24, and 10.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 19, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 13, 1, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 19, 11, 20, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 6, 8, and 10.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 22, 14, and 10.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 25, 27, 18, and 24.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 3, 17, 25, 18, 26, 28, 1, 5, 19, 6, 29, 24, 10, and 21.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 715 \]
So, there are 715 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [715].
