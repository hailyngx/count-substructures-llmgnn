Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (7, 11) (7, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph by calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (17, 8, 16, 18)  
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
   <0, (17, 8, 16)>, <0, (17, 8, 18)>, <0, (17, 16, 18)>, <0, (8, 16, 18)>

2. Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (3, 15, 19, 12)  
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
   <2, (3, 15, 19)>, <2, (3, 15, 12)>, <2, (3, 19, 12)>, <2, (15, 19, 12)>

3. Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (17, 12)  
   Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with this node.

4. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (15, 16, 18, 13)  
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
   <9, (15, 16, 18)>, <9, (15, 16, 13)>, <9, (15, 18, 13)>, <9, (16, 18, 13)>

5. Node 11: It has 3 neighbors (7, 1, 4)  
   Number of 3-stars = 1  
   <11, (7, 1, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Total = (4 + 4 + 4 + 1) = 13  
Therefore, the final result is [13].
