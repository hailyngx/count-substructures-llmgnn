Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around them.

Based on the provided edges, the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 2

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars in the graph.
