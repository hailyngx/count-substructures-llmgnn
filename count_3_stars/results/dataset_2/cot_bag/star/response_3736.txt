Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 11) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 7) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (16, 2) (16, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (5, 6, 15)>
<5, (2, 8, 6)>
<6, (5, 10, 15)>
<8, (5, 19, 17)>
<9, (18, 4, 11)>
<11, (0, 19, 17)>
<15, (2, 18, 7)>
<17, (8, 3, 11)>
<19, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (14, 9, 1)>
<7, (18, 14, 13)>
<10, (6, 13, 12)>
<18, (9, 7, 15)>
<1, (4, 19, 1)>
<16, (2, 3, 16)>
<3, (19, 17, 16)>
