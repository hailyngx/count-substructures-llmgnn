Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Since node 6 has 7 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [35 + 20] = 55 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
