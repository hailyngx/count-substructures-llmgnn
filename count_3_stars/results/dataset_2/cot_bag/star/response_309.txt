Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1 and node 4.

For node 1:
There are 6 edges connected to node 1: (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 9), (1, 0), (1, 12).
So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed around node 1.

For node 4:
There are 5 edges connected to node 4: (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 6).
So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed around node 4.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10] = 30 \).
