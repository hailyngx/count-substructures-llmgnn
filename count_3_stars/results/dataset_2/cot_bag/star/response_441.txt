Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For Node 6: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For Node 7: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For Node 8: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For Node 9: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 20 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (7, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
