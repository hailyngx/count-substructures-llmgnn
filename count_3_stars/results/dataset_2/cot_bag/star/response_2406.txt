Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 3) => [\(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars]
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors (5, 9, 2) => [1 3-star]
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors (5, 8, 1) => [1 3-star]
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 0) => [1 3-star]
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 0) => [1 3-star]
- Node 5: has 6 neighbors (9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 0) => [\(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20 3-stars]
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 0) => [\(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars]
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8) => [\(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20 3-stars]
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors (7, 2, 3) => [1 3-star]
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 1, 7) => [\(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10] = [74]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)> 
<0, (1, 3, 7)> 
<0, (1, 5, 7)> 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
