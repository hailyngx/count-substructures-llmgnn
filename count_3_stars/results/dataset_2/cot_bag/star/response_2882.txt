Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 10) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 18) (27, 23) (27, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 16) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 17) (4, 2) (6, 22) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 1) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 7) (11, 28) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 7) (9, 10) (29, 24) (2, 4) (2, 15) (17, 4) (17, 25) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 10) (23, 27) (23, 26) (16, 8) (16, 21) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 20) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 24) (20, 19) (20, 18) (20, 24) (12, 13) (12, 21) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 14) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 5) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors {3, 24, 18}
- Node 4 with neighbors {8, 5, 17, 2}
- Node 13 with neighbors {22, 12, 19}
- Node 15 with neighbors {2, 25, 18, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, which can be represented as [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 24, 18)>
- <4, (8, 5, 17)>
- <4, (8, 5, 2)>
- <4, (8, 17, 2)>
- <13, (22, 12, 19)>
- <15, (2, 25, 18)>
- <15, (2, 25, 5)>
- <15, (2, 18, 5)>
- <15, (25, 18, 5)>
