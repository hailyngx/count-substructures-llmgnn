Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
1. Node 0: 9, 6, 4, 7, 8
2. Node 1: 6, 7, 2
3. Node 2: 5, 9, 4, 1
4. Node 3: 6
5. Node 4: 9, 6, 7, 8, 0, 2
6. Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 7
7. Node 6: 9, 1, 3, 4, 0
8. Node 7: 5, 4, 0, 1
9. Node 8: 5, 4, 0
10. Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 2, 0

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 64 \)

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [64].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
