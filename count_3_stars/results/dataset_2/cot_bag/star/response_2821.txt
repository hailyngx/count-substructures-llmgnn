Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 21) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 0) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (27, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 17) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 6) (26, 7) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 21) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 4) (28, 20) (28, 0) (28, 25) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (1, 29) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 16) (14, 18) (14, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 8) (17, 12) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 13) (9, 23) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 13) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 13) (4, 11) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 29 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 89  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [89].
