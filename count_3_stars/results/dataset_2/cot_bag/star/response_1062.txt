- Node 0: neighbors {3, 23, 6, 10}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 24}
- Node 2: neighbors {14, 19}
- Node 3: neighbors {15, 0, 10, 20, 27}
- Node 4: neighbors {15, 17, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 12, 25, 21}
- Node 6: neighbors {15, 0, 27}
- Node 7: neighbors {19, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 25, 21}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 10: neighbors {3, 0}
- Node 11: neighbor {29}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 21}
- Node 13: neighbors {15, 7, 25, 20, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {2, 17}
- Node 15: neighbors {3, 6, 13, 4}
- Node 16: neighbors {23, 19}
- Node 17: neighbors {14, 4, 25}

- Node 24: neighbor {1}
- Node 25: neighbors {5, 8, 13, 17}
- Node 26: neighbors {22, 20, 27}
- Node 27: neighbors {3, 29, 26, 6}
- Node 28: neighbors {23, 18, 29, 21}
- Node 29: neighbors {18, 28, 27, 11}

Considering the information provided, we can see that the following nodes have three or more neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each node and add the counts together to find the total number of 3-stars. Let's calculate this:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 15, 17, 8 (total 3 stars)
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 4, 25, 21 (total 3 stars)
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 13 (total 3 stars)
- Node 17 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 14, 4, 25 (total 3 stars)
- Node 19 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 7, 16, 2 (total 3 stars)
- Node 21 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 28 (total 3 stars)
- Node 23 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 22, 16, 0 (total 3 stars)
- Node 25 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 13 (total 3 stars)
- Node 26 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 22, 20, 27 (total 3 stars)
- Node 27 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 3, 29, 26 (total 3 stars)
- Node 28 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 23, 18, 29 (total 3 stars)
- Node 29 can form 3-stars with its 3 neighbors: 18, 28, 27 (total 3 stars)

Adding up all these, we have a total of 86 3-stars. So, the answer is [86].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 6, 13)>, <4, (15, 17, 8)>, <5, (9, 12, 25)>, <8, (4, 21, 25)>, <13, (7, 15, 19)>, <15, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<17, (4, 14, 25)>, <19, (2, 7, 16)>, <21, (5, 8, 28)>, <23, (0, 16, 22)>, <25, (5, 8, 13)>, <26, (20, 22, 27)>, 
<27, (3, 26, 29)>, <28, (18, 23, 29)>, <29, (18, 27, 28)>.
