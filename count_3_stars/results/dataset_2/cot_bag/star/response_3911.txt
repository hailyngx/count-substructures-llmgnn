Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 12, 13, 2 Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 13, 14
Node 2: 0, 5, 8, 12
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 10
Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 11
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 Node 6: 4, 6, 13, 14
Node 7: 4, 7, 8, 10, 11
Node 8: 2, 7
Node 9: 5, 6, 9, 14
Node 10: 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11
Node 11: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12
Node 12: 0, 2, 11, 12, 13
Node 13: 0, 1, 6, 12, 13, 0 Node 14: 1, 6, 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: C(6,3) = 20 Node 1: C(5,3) = 10 Node 2: C(3,3) = 1 Node 3: C(4,3) = 4 Node 4: C(4,3) = 4 Node 5: C(5,3) = 10 Node 6: C(4,3) = 4 Node 7: C(5,3) = 10 Node 9: C(4,3) = 4 Node 10: C(6,3) = 20 Node 11: C(4,3) = 4 Node 12: C(5,3) = 10 Node 13: C(6,3) = 20 Node 14: C(3,3) = 1

Summing up the number of 3-stars, we get 112 total 3-stars found in the graph, which we represent as [112]. 

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 13)>, <0, (1, 2, 12)>, <0, (4, 6, 13)>, <0, (4, 7, 11)>, <0, (4, 12, 13)>, <0, (7, 11, 12)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 13, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <2, (0, 12, 13)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 13)>, <7, (4, 10, 11)>, <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <10, (5, 7, 11)>, <10, (5, 9, 10)>, <10, (7, 11, 12)>, <10, (9, 11, 14)>, <11, (4, 7, 10)>, <11, (7, 10, 12)>, <12, (0, 2, 12)>, <13, (0, 12, 13)>, <13, (0, 6, 13)>, <13, (6, 12, 13)>
