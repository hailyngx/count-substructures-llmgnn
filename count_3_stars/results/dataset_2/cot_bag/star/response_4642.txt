Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
With the given information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 2: Neighbors {4, 13, 5, 0, 9, 14}
Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9, 5}
Node 4: Neighbors {7, 10, 11, 2, 12}
Node 6: Neighbors {10, 8, 5, 12, 0}
Node 9: Neighbors {3, 8, 13, 2, 14}
Node 10: Neighbors {4, 7, 11, 6, 12, 14}
Node 12: Neighbors {4, 10, 11, 6, 14}
Node 13: Neighbors {7, 2, 9, 14}
Node 14: Neighbors {10, 13, 2, 9, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 95

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [95].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 0, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (10, 11, 12)>
<6, (10, 12, 0)>
<9, (3, 2, 13)>
<10, (4, 11, 14)>
<12, (4, 11, 14)>
<13, (7, 9, 14)>
<14, (10, 12, 13)>
