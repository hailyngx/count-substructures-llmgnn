Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (15, 8) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 19) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 6) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 2) (5, 14) (5, 16) (5, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (14, 5, 16): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (10, 13, 6): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (10, 16, 6, 19): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 5, 12): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 2): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (13, 8, 4, 11, 16): [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (0, 15, 9, 19): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (4, 18, 3, 19): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (17, 1, 9, 3, 13): [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors (8, 11): 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors (0, 9, 18, 2, 5): [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (12, 11, 2, 1): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 52, which can be represented as [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 16>, <1, 6, 10>, <2, 10, 19>, <2, 6, 16>, <2, 6, 19>, <2, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 9, 16>, <4, 5, 16>, <6, 1, 10>, <6, 1, 13>, <6, 2, 19>, <6, 2, 10>, <9, 4, 16>, <9, 11, 13>, <9, 11, 16>, <9, 11, 19>, <9, 13, 1>, <9, 13, 3>, <9, 13, 16>, <9, 13, 4>, <11, 0, 15>, <11, 9, 16>, <11, 9, 19>, <11, 19, 2>, <12, 4, 18>, <12, 4, 3>, <12, 4, 19>, <12, 18, 16>, <13, 1, 10>, <13, 1, 6>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 3, 9>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 3, 12>, <15, 8, 11>, <16, 0, 9>, <16, 0, 14>, <16, 0, 5>, <16, 2, 6>, <16, 2, 19>, <16, 9, 11>, <16, 9, 13>, <16, 9, 13>, <16, 9, 4>, <16, 18, 12>, <19, 1, 11>, <19, 2, 12>
