Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.

Adding up all these possibilities, we get 33 3-stars in total: [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (14, 4, 10)>
- <1, (17, 8, 16)>
- <3, (12, 6, 8)>
- <12, (7, 16, 9)>
- <13, (14, 18, 10)>
- <14, (17, 0, 9)>
- <16, (2, 12, 4)>
- <17, (14, 1, 19)>
- <18, (2, 4, 8)>
- <19, (17, 15, 1)>
