Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 16) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 15) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 13) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 12) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (19, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars 
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars 
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars 
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars 
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars 
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 5>
<2, 6, 14>
<6, 15, 12>
<8, 17, 13>
<13, 15, 1>
<15, 12, 18>
<16, 18, 9>
