Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 4) (27, 16) (27, 10) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 6) (20, 15) (20, 7) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 14) (21, 28) (21, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 18) (26, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (7, 20) (7, 24) (25, 11) (25, 29) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 18) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (3, 17) (24, 9) (24, 7) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 18) (0, 8) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 26) (12, 1) (18, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 15, 7, 6, 28, 8, 26, 4, 1, 9, 22, 10, 3, 24, 29, 5, 14, 12, 18, 22.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node. If \( n < 3 \), no 3-star will be formed.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 61 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 12, 1)>, <3, (9, 17, 3)>, <3, (3, 21, 17)>, <3, (3, 17, 9)>, <3, (16, 4, 3)>, <5, (22, 26, 5)>, <6, (28, 6, 21)>, <6, (6, 28, 21)>, <6, (6, 21, 28)>, <7, (7, 20, 24)>, <8, (14, 8, 5)>, <8, (14, 5, 8)>, <8, (14, 9, 8)>, <8, (14, 8, 9)>, <9, (11, 9, 24)>, <9, (9, 24, 11)>, <9, (9, 14, 8)>, <9, (9, 8, 14)>, <10, (10, 22, 26)>, <10, (10, 15, 4)>, <10, (10, 4, 15)>, <10, (10, 26, 22)>, <11, (19, 11, 25)>, <12, (1, 6, 12)>, <15, (20, 4, 15)>, <15, (15, 20, 4)>
