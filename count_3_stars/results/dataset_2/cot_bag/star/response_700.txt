Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 0) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 8) (15, 20) (15, 17) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (28, 29) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 7) (4, 9) (27, 24) (27, 21) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 13) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 3) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 8) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (21, 27) (21, 11) (25, 28) (25, 9) (14, 5) (14, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 7) (19, 24) (19, 1) (7, 26) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 16) (16, 13) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 1) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 18, 24, 29}.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 50 3-stars [50].
