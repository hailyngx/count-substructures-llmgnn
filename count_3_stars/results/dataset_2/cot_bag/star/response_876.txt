Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
With the given information, let's first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {6, 2, 8, 12}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {4, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {9, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {10, 14, 12, 6}
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {5, 9, 8, 3, 7}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {5, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {2, 8, 12, 1}
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {5, 11, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {10, 7, 0, 13}
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 0, 3, 13}
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {9, 12, 1, 4}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is  [58].
