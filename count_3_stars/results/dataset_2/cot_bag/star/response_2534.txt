Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 53 \)

So, there are 53 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the answer is [53].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<3, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
<0, (4, 3, 14)>
<2, (7, 9, 14)>
<12, (3, 6, 8)>
