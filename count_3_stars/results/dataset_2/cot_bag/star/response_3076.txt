Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62 \). 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
