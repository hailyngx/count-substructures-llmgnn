Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 17) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 26) (25, 17) (25, 8) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 23) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 16) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 25) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 18) (29, 22) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (26, 3) (26, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 20) (19, 27) (14, 3) (14, 6) (16, 21) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 1) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 26) (23, 15) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (28, 9) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 22) (24, 10) (24, 20) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 19) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 24) (27, 9) (27, 19) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 20) (20, 19) (20, 24) (20, 22) (18, 17) (18, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 10)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 28), (9, 11), (9, 27)
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 28)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 21), (7, 17)
- Node 21: (21, 7), (21, 3), (21, 16), (21, 23)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 23), (6, 16)
- Node 2: (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 13)
- Node 8: (8, 25), (8, 2), (8, 19), (8, 0)
- Node 17: (17, 7), (17, 25), (17, 18)
- Node 19: (19, 8), (19, 15), (19, 11), (19, 20), (19, 27)
- Node 3: (3, 21), (3, 14), (3, 26)
- Node 25: (25, 17), (25, 8)
- Node 23: (23, 21), (23, 6), (23, 26), (23, 15)
- Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 1)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
