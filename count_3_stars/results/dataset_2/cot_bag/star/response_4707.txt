Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 19) (17, 6) (17, 2) (9, 19) (9, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 12) (2, 17) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) 

Response:
The graph described has the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 9, 12, 10
- Node 1: 11, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 17
- Node 3: 1, 7, 0, 14, 8
- Node 4: 19
- Node 5: 1, 12, 15
- Node 6: 17, 10, 7, 14
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 19, 3
- Node 9: 19, 0
- Node 10: 0, 6, 18
- Node 11: 16, 1, 18, 15
- Node 12: 19, 5, 14, 0
- Node 13: 18, 15
- Node 14: 3, 12, 6
- Node 15: 11, 16, 5, 13
- Node 16: 11, 15
- Node 17: 6, 2
- Node 18: 11, 10, 13
- Node 19: 8, 4, 9, 12

Let's determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed and identify the unique 3-stars:

Number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 12)>
<0, (3, 9, 10)>
<0, (3, 12, 10)>
<0, (9, 12, 10)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 14, 12)>
<3, (5, 12, 14)>
<3, (8, 19, 4)>
<5, (1, 15, 11)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<11, (15, 16, 5)>
<12, (19, 5, 14)>
<15, (11, 16, 5)>
<18, (11, 13, 15)>
<19, (8, 4, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34] with the unique 3-stars listed above.
