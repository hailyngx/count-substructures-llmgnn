Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (10, 17) (11, 7) (11, 19) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 12) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 9) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Some of the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 12, 15)>
<2, (0, 12, 13)>
<4, (1, 8, 19)>
<7, (11, 14, 17)>
<8, (3, 4, 19)>
<12, (8, 13, 15)>
<13, (2, 12, 18)>
<14, (6, 7, 16)>
<16, (9, 14, 19)>
<17, (6, 7, 10)>
<19, (8, 11, 16)>
