Response:
There are 10 nodes with only 1 neighbor and 20 nodes with 2 neighbors. These nodes cannot form a 3-star. 
We need to focus on the remaining nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 26, 6, 11. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 9, 24, 16. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 21, 19, 22, 11. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 7, 11, 2. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 7, 23, 19, 24. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 23 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 13, 28, 1. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 18. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 15, 1. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 10, 28, 4. It can form 1 3-star.
