Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (7, 3, 8)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 4, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (5, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (9, 0, 6)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (7, 1, 6)
- Node 5: 6 neighbors (9, 6, 1, 8, 2, 7) - this is our center node
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (5, 4, 7, 3, 8)
- Node 7: 6 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 0, 6, 8)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (5, 1, 6, 7, 0)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 2, 3, 7)

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [2]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 5: [15]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [15 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [22].  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (1, 8, 2)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <7, (5, 9, 0)>
- <6, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (5, 9, 0)>
- <5, (7, 9, 4)>
- <5, (7, 9, 0)>
- <5, (7, 0, 8)>
- <5, (7, 6, 4)>
- <5, (7, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 1, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 4)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 0)>
- <9, (5, 3, 6)>
- <9, (7, 0, 4)>
- <9, (7, 4, 6)>
- <9, (7, 8, 0)>
- <5, (7, 6, 3)>
- <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- <5, (6, 1, 8)>
- <5, (6, 4, 7)>
