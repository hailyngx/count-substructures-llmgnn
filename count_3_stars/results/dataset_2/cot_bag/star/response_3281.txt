Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 84 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (8, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<5, (0, 1, 14)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 7, 13)>
<11, (2, 5, 14)>
<13, (8, 9, 14)>
<14, (1, 2, 5)>
