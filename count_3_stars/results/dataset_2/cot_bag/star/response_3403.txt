Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7. It forms one 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 7)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. It forms one 3-star: <2, (9, 6, 8)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8. It forms one 3-star: <3, (9, 4, 8)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 8, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 8)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 4. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 2, and 9. It forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 1, and 3. It forms four 3-stars: <7, (9, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 1, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (1, 8, 3)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. It forms five 3-stars: <8, (4, 3, 2)>, <8, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 2, 1)>, <8, (3, 2, 7)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and 6. It forms five 3-stars: <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 5] = [19].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (9, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 1, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (1, 8, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 2)>, <8, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 2, 1)>, <8, (3, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
