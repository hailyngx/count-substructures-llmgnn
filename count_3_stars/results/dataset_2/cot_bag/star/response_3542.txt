Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 14) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 12) (22, 1) (4, 8) (4, 23) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 19) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 16) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 25) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 26) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 5) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 28) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 16) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 14) (11, 22) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 27) (3, 20) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 25) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 27) (9, 24) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 9) (5, 14) (12, 22) (12, 24) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 25) (20, 8) (20, 3) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3.

Summing up the number of 3-stars, 
we get a total of [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 58.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 17, 28)>, <1, (13, 21, 28)>, <1, (13, 22, 28)>, <1, (13, 28, 0)>, <2, (8, 18, 26)>, <2, (18, 26, 27)>, <2, (18, 26, 14)>, <2, (18, 26, 8)>, <4, (4, 8, 26)>, <7, (7, 19, 29)>, <8, (3, 20, 26)>, <11, (11, 21, 27)>, <11, (11, 22, 27)>, <11, (11,...
