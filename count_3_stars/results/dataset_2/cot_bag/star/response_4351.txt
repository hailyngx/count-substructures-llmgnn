Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 108 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [108].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 10, 11)>
- <4, (7, 10, 11)>
- <8, (0, 12, 13)>
- <9, (4, 10, 11)>
- <10, (6, 1, 11)>
- <11, (10, 1, 8)>
- <12, (10, 11, 14)>
- <14, (0, 5, 13)>
