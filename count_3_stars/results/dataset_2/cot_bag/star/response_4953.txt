Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 16) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 7) (15, 9) (15, 22) (20, 13) (20, 24) (20, 11) (7, 27) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 16) (13, 0) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (25, 28) (25, 22) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 14) (11, 26) (11, 20) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 18) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 5) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 5) (22, 15) (22, 25) (22, 14) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 16) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors the node has.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: has 2 neighbors -> No 3-star
- Node 16: has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: has 3 neighbors -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated above, we get:

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Distinct 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (13, 17, 3)>, <1, (16, 18, 29)>, <6, (17, 18, 21)>, <8, (10, 24, 14)>, <9, (15, 21, 26)>, <10, (2, 8, 28)>, <11, (14, 20, 26)>, <13, (0, 16, 26)>, <14, (1, 22, 23)>, <16, (1, 4, 18)>, <19, (2, 8, 29)>, <20, (11, 13, 24)>, <21, (9, 18, 28)>, <22, (14, 15, 25)>, <24, (8, 14, 20)>, <26, (11, 13, 16)>, <28, (10, 22, 25)>, <29, (1, 5, 19)>
