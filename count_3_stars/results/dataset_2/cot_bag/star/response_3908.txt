Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, let's identify these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 5: There are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 8: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 15: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 15.
- Node 16: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 16.
- Node 17: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 17.
- Node 18: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 18.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes in this graph is 48. Therefore, the answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 13>
- <0, 6, 17>
- <0, 8, 15>
- <0, 8, 6>
- <1, 6, 16>
- <1, 6, 18>
- <3, 5, 15>
- <3, 8, 15>
- <4, 9, 19>
- <5, 11, 16>
- <14, 13, 18>
