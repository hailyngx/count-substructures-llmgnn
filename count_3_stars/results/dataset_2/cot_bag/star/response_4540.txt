Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 23) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 25) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 24) (26, 16) (26, 0) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 4) (17, 21) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (21, 17) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 15) (8, 22) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 29) (23, 9) (28, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 19) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 2) (16, 26) (16, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 24) (4, 17) (25, 11) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 29) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 2) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 22) (22, 17) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6: neighbors 9, 14, 10, 19, 20 (degree 5)
- Node 9: neighbors 6, 24, 23, 0 (degree 4)
- Node 13: neighbors 1, 27, 11, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 20: neighbors 6, 5, 11, 17 (degree 4)
- Node 14: neighbors 6, 3, 12, 29, 2 (degree 5)
- Node 17: neighbors 20, 16, 22, 4, 21 (degree 5)
- Node 21: neighbors 17, 10, 22, 15 (degree 4)
- Node 19: neighbors 6, 2, 29 (degree 3)
- Node 29: neighbors 19, 7, 0, 15, 14 (degree 5)
- Node 24: neighbors 9, 5, 18, 2 (degree 4)
- Node 15: neighbors 11, 21, 29, 22 (degree 4)
- Node 22: neighbors 17, 21, 8, 15 (degree 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 29: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].
