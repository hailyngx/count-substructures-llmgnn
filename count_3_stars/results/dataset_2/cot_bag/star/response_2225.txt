Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 19) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 19) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 18) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19.

Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[
\binom{10}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 120 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 148
\]

So, there are 148 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 9, 17)>
<3, (8, 13, 3)>
<6, (1, 6, 19)>
<8, (3, 8, 13)>
<9, (0, 9, 17)>
<10, (0, 2, 10)>
<12, (2, 12, 14)>
<13, (3, 13, 14)>
<14, (12, 14, 18)>
<16, (11, 15, 16)>
<17, (4, 9, 17)>
<19, (6, 9, 19)>

So the final answer is [148].
