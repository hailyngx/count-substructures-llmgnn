Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
This graph has several nodes with only one or two edges connected to them. We're interested in finding the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 2)
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 11), (1, 10), (1, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 11), (2, 6), (2, 14), (2, 0)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 11), (3, 13), (3, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 3), (9, 1)
- Node 10: (10, 9), (10, 1), (10, 12), (10, 14), (10, 6)
- Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 3), (11, 2)
- Node 12: (12, 10), (12, 14), (12, 0)
- Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 3)
- Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 8), (14, 12), (14, 2), (14, 10)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with itself, resulting in 1 3-star.
- Nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 2, 5, and 9 each can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 cannot form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
- Node 6 is isolated and thus cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 8 \times 10 + 3 \times 20 = 1 + 80 + 60 = 141 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [141].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- <1, (9, 4, 3)>
- <3, (4, 2, 11)>
- <4, (9, 8, 1)>
- <5, (9, 2, 0)>
- <8, (5, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 14, 10)>
- <10, (9, 1, 14)>
- <11, (1, 3, 2)>
- <12, (10, 14, 0)>
- <14, (9, 12, 10)>
