Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars with node 1 as the central node are: 
    - <1, (3, 11, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 11, 14)>
    - <1, (3, 7, 14)>
    - <1, (11, 7, 14)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars with node 3 as the central node are: 
    - <3, (1, 11, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 11, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 4)>
    - <3, (11, 5, 4)>
    - <3, (11, 7, 4)>
    - <3, (11, 7, 12)>
    - <3, (5, 4, 11)>
    - <3, (7, 4, 11)>

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars with node 4 as the central node are: 
    - <4, (3, 9, 12)>
    - <4, (3, 9, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 12, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 12, 14)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 14)>
    - <4, (9, 12, 5)>
    - <4, (9, 12, 0)>
    - <4, (9, 5, 0)>
    - <4, (9, 5, 14)>
    - <4, (12, 5, 14)>
    - <4, (12, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (12, 14, 6)>
    - <4, (12, 14, 13)>
    - <4, (5, 14, 6)>
    - <4, (5, 14, 13)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 13)>
    - <4, (9, 0, 5)>
    - <4, (9, 0, 14)>
    - <4, (9, 5, 14)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 14)>

- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars with node 12 as the central node are: 
    - <12, (10, 11, 4)>
    - <12, (10, 11, 2)>
    - <12, (10, 4, 2)>
    - <12, (10, 4, 6)>
    - <12, (10, 2, 6)>
    - <12, (11, 4, 2)>
    - <12, (11, 4, 6)>
    - <12, (11, 2, 6)>
    - <12, (4, 2, 6)>
    - <12, (4, 2, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 44 3-stars formed. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
