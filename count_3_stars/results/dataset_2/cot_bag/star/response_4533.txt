Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 18) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 3) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 2) (19, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4+4+10+4+4+4+1+4+4+4+4+4+0 = 47 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [47].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (5, 6, 13)>, 
<1, (8, 9, 13)>, 
<2, (4, 14, 19)>, 
<3, (10, 11, 12)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (11, 12, 14)>, 
<9, (8, 11, 17)>, 
<12, (3, 7, 13)>, 
<13, (0, 12, 18)>, 
<14, (1, 2, 12)>.
