Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (2, 6, 9)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 6, 8)
- Node 3: (4, 8, 10, 12)
- Node 4: (1, 3, 11)
- Node 5: (7, 13, 14)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 2, 10, 12, 14)
- Node 7: (1, 5, 11, 12, 14)
- Node 8: (2, 3)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 10, 13)
- Node 10: (3, 6, 9)
- Node 11: (4, 7, 13, 14)
- Node 12: (1, 3, 6, 7, 12)
- Node 13: (5, 9, 11)
- Node 14: (5, 6, 7, 11)

Based on the above neighbors, we can identify the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 forms 15 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 20 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 12 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars

Summing these up the total number of 3-stars = 15 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 2 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 71

So, in this graph, there are [71] 3-stars identified.
