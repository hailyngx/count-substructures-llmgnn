Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 47 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
