Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

For node 5, there is 1 3-star.
For node 13, there is 1 3-star.
For node 8, there is 1 3-star.
For node 7, there is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 6, there is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 17, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
	<17, (19, 11, 0)>, <17, (19, 11, 18)>, <17, (19, 0, 11)>, <17, (11, 0, 18)>
For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
	<11, (19, 17, 0)>, <11, (19, 17, 18)>, <11, (19, 0, 18)>, <11, (17, 0, 18)>
For node 19, there are 4 3-stars:
	<19, (17, 11, 0)>, <19, (17, 11, 12)>, <19, (17, 0, 11)>, <19, (11, 0, 12)>
For node 1, there is 1 3-star.
For node 2, there is 1 3-star.
For node 4, there is 1 3-star.
For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
	<0, (11, 18, 15)>, <0, (11, 18, 5)>, <0, (11, 15, 5)>, <0, (18, 15, 5)>
For node 15, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
	<15, (13, 8, 17)>, <15, (13, 8, 0)>, <15, (13, 17, 0)>, <15, (8, 17, 0)>, <15, (8, 17, 5)>, <15, (8, 0, 5)>, <15, (17, 0, 5)>, <15, (17, 0, 13)>, <15, (0, 5, 13)>, <15, (0, 5, 18)>
    
Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 27 three-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<17, (19, 11, 0)>, <17, (19, 11, 18)>, <17, (19, 0, 11)>, <17, (11, 0, 18)>, 
<11, (19, 17, 0)>, <11, (19, 17, 18)>, <11, (19, 0, 18)>, <11, (17, 0, 18)>, 
<19, (17, 11, 0)>, <19, (17, 11, 12)>, <19, (17, 0, 11)>, <19, (11, 0, 12)>, 
<0, (11, 18, 15)>, <0, (11, 18, 5)>, <0, (11, 15, 5)>, <0, (18, 15, 5)>, 
<15, (13, 8, 17)>, <15, (13, 8, 0)>, <15, (13, 17, 0)>, <15, (8, 17, 0)>, 
<15, (8, 17, 5)>, <15, (8, 0, 5)>, <15, (17, 0, 5)>, <15, (17, 0, 13)>, 
<15, (0, 5, 13)>, <15, (0, 5, 18)>
