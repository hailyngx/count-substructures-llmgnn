Response:
First, let's visualize the graph as described:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
- 0: {7, 28, 26}
- 1: {7, 20, 19, 14}
- 2: {22, 11}
- 3: {4, 18, 17}
- 4: {7, 16, 11, 3}
- 5: {13, 10}
- 6: {25, 24, 8, 16}
- 7: {4, 12, 0, 1}
- 8: {6, 9, 19, 27}
- 9: {8}
- 10: {21, 20, 5}
- 11: {4, 2, 24}
- 12: {7, 15}
- 13: {20, 5}
- 14: {1, 23}
- 15: {12, 17, 28}
- 16: {4, 6, 19}
- 17: {3, 26, 15}
- 18: {25, 29, 26, 3}
- 19: {8, 1, 16, 23}
- 20: {1, 26, 13, 10}
- 21: {10, 27, 22, 24}
- 22: {21, 2, 29}
- 23: {19, 14}
- 24: {21, 6, 11, 27}
- 25: {6, 18}
- 26: {20, 0, 18, 17}
- 27: {21, 8, 24}
- 28: {0, 15}
- 29: {22, 18}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-star configurations following the steps mentioned in the initial message.

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 3 neighbors (7, 28, 26), it can form 1 3-star. So, [1]
<0, (7, 28, 26)>

- Node 1: Node 1 also has 4 neighbors (7, 20, 19, 14), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<1, (7, 20, 19)>

- Node 3: Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 18, 17), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<3, (4, 18, 17)>

- Node 4: Node 4 has 4 neighbors (7, 16, 11, 3), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<4, (7, 16, 11)>

- Node 6: Node 6 also has 4 neighbors (25, 24, 8, 16), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<6, (25, 24, 8)>

- Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (4, 12, 0, 1), allowing it to form 1 3-star. [1]
<7, (4, 12, 0)>

- Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 19, 27), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<8, (6, 9, 19)>

- Node 10: Node 10 has 3 neighbors (21, 20, 5), forming 1 3-star. [1]
<10, (21, 20, 5)>

- Node 11: Node 11 has 3 neighbors (4, 2, 24), forming 1 3-star. [1]
<11, (4, 2, 24)>

- Node 15: Node 15 has 3 neighbors (12, 17, 28), allowing it to form 1 3-star. [1]
<15, (12, 17, 28)>

- Node 16: Node 16 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 19), forming 1 3-star. [1]
<16, (4, 6, 19)>

- Node 18: Node 18 has 4 neighbors (25, 29, 26, 3), so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
<18, (25, 29, 26)>

- Node 19: Node 19 has 4 neighbors (8, 1, 16, 23), allowing it to form 1 3-star. [1]
<19, (8, 1, 16)>

- Node 20: Node 20 has 4 neighbors (1, 26, 13, 10), forming 1 3-star. [1]
<20, (1, 26, 13)>

- Node 21: Node 21 has 4 neighbors (10, 27, 22, 24), allowing it to form 1 3-star. [1]
<21, (10, 27, 22)>

- Node 26: Node 26 has 4 neighbors (20, 0, 18, 17), forming 1 3-star. [1]
<26, (20, 0, 18)>

- Node 27: Node 27 has 3 neighbors (21, 8, 24), allowing it to form 1 3-star. [1]
<27, (21, 8, 24)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

Please note that each 3-star configuration is listed exactly once for uniqueness.
