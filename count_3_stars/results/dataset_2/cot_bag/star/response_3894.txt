Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 10) (26, 1) (26, 21) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (4, 18) (4, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 6) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 24) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 24) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 29) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 25) (6, 20) (6, 3) (6, 29) (6, 11) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 19) (19, 13) (19, 29) (19, 12) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 16) (9, 16) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 27) (16, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 27) (11, 5) (12, 22) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 2 neighbors are: 
- Node 2 with neighbors 18, 14, 21, and 15
- Node 4 with neighbors 18, 14
- Node 5 with neighbors 18, 17, 25, and 11
- Node 8 with neighbors 23, 28, 25, and 17
- Node 10 with neighbors 13, 1, 25, and 29
- Node 11 with neighbors 22, 6, 27, and 5
- Node 13 with neighbors 22, 10, 19
- Node 14 with neighbors 2, 0, 4
- Node 16 with neighbors 1, 15, 27, and 9
- Node 21 with neighbors 2, 26, 0, 28
- Node 22 with neighbors 13, 27, 11, 12
- Node 25 with neighbors 8, 17, 5, 10
- Node 27 with neighbors 22, 11, 16
- Node 28 with neighbors 8, 21, 24
- Node 29 with neighbors 10, 6, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 2 neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 21 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star
- Node 25 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 22, so [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (18, 14, 21)>
- <5, (18, 17, 25)>
- <8, (23, 28, 25)>
- <8, (23, 28, 24)>
- <8, (23, 25, 24)>
- <8, (8, 25, 17)>
- <10, (13, 1, 25)>
- <11, (22, 6, 27)>
- <11, (6, 27, 16)>
- <13, (22, 19, 10)>
- <14, (2, 0, 4)>
- <16, (1, 15, 27)>
- <16, (1, 9, 27)>
- <21, (2, 26, 0)>
- <21, (2, 28, 0)>
- <21, (26, 28, 0)>
- <21, (26, 28, 24)>
- <25, (8, 17, 5)>
- <25, (8, 25, 24)>
- <25, (23, 25, 24)>
- <25, (17, 25, 5)>
- <28, (8, 21, 24)>
- <28, (21, 24, 25)>
- <29, (6, 19, 10)>
