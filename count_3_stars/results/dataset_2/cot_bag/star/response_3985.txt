Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 8) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 20 choose 3 = 1140
- Node 3: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 9: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 10: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 11: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 15: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 16: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 17: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 18: 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding these up: 1140 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 1199

Therefore, there are 1199 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (12, 19, 1)>
<3, (15, 7, 1)>
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (5, 12, 18)>
<10, (3, 12, 11)>
<11, (16, 18, 9)>
<12, (0, 1, 19)>
<15, (3, 7, 1)>
<16, (11, 0, 17)>
<17, (16, 4, 7)>
<18, (11, 9, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1199].
