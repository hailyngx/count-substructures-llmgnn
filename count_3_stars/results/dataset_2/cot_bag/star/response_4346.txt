Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 24) (21, 15) (21, 8) (21, 18) (21, 14) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 18) (8, 27) (13, 17) (13, 14) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 19) (20, 7) (20, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 25) (18, 21) (18, 8) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 3) (26, 18) (26, 14) (9, 15) (9, 29) (9, 27) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (14, 21) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 25) (7, 20) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 11) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 24) (4, 16) (22, 11) (11, 20) (11, 29) (11, 5) (11, 22) (3, 23) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (19, 23) (19, 0) (19, 10) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 8) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 28) (28, 25) (28, 2) (28, 12) 

Response:
Inside the brackets [], we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors. 

For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [52] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 52.
