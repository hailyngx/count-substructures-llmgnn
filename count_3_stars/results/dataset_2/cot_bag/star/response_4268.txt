Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For node 0: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (3, 4, 11)>, <0, (3, 4, 14)>, <0, (4, 7, 11)>, <0, (4, 7, 14)>

- For node 1: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <1, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (3, 10, 14)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>, <1, (11, 13, 14)>

- For node 2: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2, (3, 4, 12)>, <2, (3, 8, 12)>, <2, (3, 12, 13)>, <2, (4, 8, 12)>, <2, (4, 12, 13)>, <2, (8, 12, 13)>, 
  <2, (6, 12, 14)>, <2, (6, 13, 14)>, <2, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (4, 12, 13)>

- For node 3: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <3, (0, 1, 13)>

- For node 4: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (0, 2, 13)>

- For node 5: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (1, 11, 4)>, <5, (1, 11, 9)>, <5, (4, 9, 11)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>

- For node 6: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <6, (13, 14, 2)>

- For node 7: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <7, (0, 9, 12)>

- For node 9: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <9, (5, 10, 1)>, <9, (10, 2, 7)>, <9, (10, 1, 7)>, <9, (10, 2, 0)>

- For node 10: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (1, 9, 11)>, <10, (1, 12, 7)>, <10, (11, 13, 1)>, <10, (11, 13, 14)>

- For node 11: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <11, (9, 1, 0)>, <11, (10, 1, 13)>, <11, (10, 1, 0)>, <11, (13, 4, 14)>

- For node 12: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <12, (2, 10, 7)>

- For node 13: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <13, (4, 11, 6)>, <13, (3, 6, 14)>, <13, (3, 4, 6)>, <13, (3, 6, 12)>

- For node 14: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <14, (6, 0, 1)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above, we have a total of [33] unique 3-stars in the graph.
