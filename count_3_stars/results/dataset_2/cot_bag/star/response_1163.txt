Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 9 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 9 
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8 
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (degree 4), so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (degree 4), so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 2: It has 6 neighbors (degree 6), so it forms 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 3: It has 2 neighbors (degree 2), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (degree 3), so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5: It has 5 neighbors (degree 5), so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (degree 3), so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (degree 4), so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 8: It has 5 neighbors (degree 5), so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (degree 4), so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>
