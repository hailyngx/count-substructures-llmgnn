Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 15) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the connections for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {13, 11, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 11}
- Node 2: {17, 18, 5, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 2, 19}
- Node 5: {10, 2, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {17, 6, 16, 9}
- Node 8: {15, 5}
- Node 9: {7, 16, 11}
- Node 10: {17, 5}
- Node 11: {1, 0, 14, 9, 5}
- Node 12: {18, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {17, 0}
- Node 14: {19, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 15: {8, 14, 12}
- Node 16: {18, 7, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 13, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {2, 16, 12}
- Node 19: {4, 0, 14}

Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors, we can find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (17, 18, 5)>
  - <2, (17, 5, 4)>
  - <2, (18, 5, 4)>
  - <2, (17, 18, 4)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (3, 2, 19)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (10, 2, 8)>
  - <5, (10, 2, 11)>
  - <5, (10, 8, 11)>
  - <5, (2, 8, 11)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (17, 16, 9)>
  - <7, (17, 16, 6)>
  - <7, (17, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (16, 9, 6)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (1, 14, 9)>
  - <11, (1, 14, 5)>
  - <11, (1, 9, 5)>
  - <11, (14, 9, 5)>
  - <11, (0, 14, 9)>
  - <11, (0, 14, 5)>
  - <11, (0, 9, 5)>
  - <11, (14, 9, 5)>
  - <11, (14, 12, 15)>
  - <11, (12, 14, 15)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <14, (19, 12, 15)>
  - <14, (19, 11, 12)>
  - <14, (19, 11, 15)>
  - <14, (12, 11, 15)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <16, (18, 7, 9)>
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [28] \).
