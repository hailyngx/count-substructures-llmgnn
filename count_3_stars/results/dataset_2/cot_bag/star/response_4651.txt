Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors (5, 9, 6, 1, 11, 8, 13, 12). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\) 3-stars.
  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
  
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 35 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 91

Therefore, we have a total of [91] 3-stars, and the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<11, (1, 10, 14)>
<8, (5, 9, 13)>
<13, (5, 8, 2)>
<12, (5, 1, 10)>
