Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14. 

Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of these nodes which have four or more neighbors, we find:
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us a total of 78 3-stars. So, the final answer is [78].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 14, 2)>
- <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- <10, (12, 1, 14)>
- <12, (4, 13, 10)>
- <1, (10, 11, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 5)>
