Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, each of the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Looking at the list of nodes, we see that only nodes 1, 3, 4, 6 have three or more neighbors, and thus can potentially form 3-stars. 

For each of these nodes, we count the number of possible 3-stars they can form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 41 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
