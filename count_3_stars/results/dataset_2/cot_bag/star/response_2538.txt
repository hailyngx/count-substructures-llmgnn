Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 20) (6, 13) (6, 21) (9, 2) (9, 15) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 16) (14, 21) (17, 13) (17, 25) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 15) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 15) (18, 21) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 0) (26, 11) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 8) (7, 1) (7, 11) (25, 17) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 0) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 10) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (2, 9) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 27) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 29) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 5) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 10) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 29) (20, 22) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 2) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with degrees greater than or equal to 3: 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 28.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 10, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 12, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 15, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 16, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 28, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 22 3-stars: [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 24>, <2, 12, 24>, <2, 12, 5>, <2, 27, 10>, <2, 27, 12>, <2, 27, 24>, <2, 27, 5>, <2, 27, 28>, <3, 16, 20>, <3, 16, 22>, <3, 16, 28>, <3, 20, 16>, <3, 20, 18>, <6, 13, 21>, <10, 4, 29>, <10, 4, 26>, <10, 8, 27>, <10, 8, 26>, <11, 26, 18>, <11, 26, 15>, <12, 5, 24>.
