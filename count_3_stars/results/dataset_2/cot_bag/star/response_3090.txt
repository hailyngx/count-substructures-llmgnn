Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 18) (7, 8) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 10) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 15) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41 \]

So there are a total of 41 unique 3-stars in this graph.
