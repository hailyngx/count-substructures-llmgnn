Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}
  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 4: [3]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: [6]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
