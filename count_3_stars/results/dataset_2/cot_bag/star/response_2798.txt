Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 6) (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (20, 25) (20, 21) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 2) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 18) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 14) (29, 10) (26, 22) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (16, 19) (8, 25) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 21) (3, 22) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (21, 20) (21, 15) (21, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (23, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (17, 5) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 9) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: 3 neighbors (7, 23, 2) => [1] 3-star
2. Node 7: 3 neighbors (4, 25, 6) => [1] 3-star
3. Node 0: 3 neighbors (27, 1, 19) => [1] 3-star
4. Node 25: 5 neighbors (7, 20, 8, 12, 2) => [10] 3-stars
5. Node 18: 4 neighbors (22, 2, 6, 24) => [4] 3-stars
6. Node 22: 4 neighbors (18, 26, 10, 3) => [4] 3-stars
7. Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 25, 18) => [1] 3-star
8. Node 28: 3 neighbors (29, 11, 16) => [1] 3-star
9. Node 10: 4 neighbors (22, 29, 15, 6) => [4] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [26]
