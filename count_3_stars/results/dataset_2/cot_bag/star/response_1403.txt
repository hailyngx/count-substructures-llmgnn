Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (5, 8) (19, 10) (19, 4) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 14) (13, 3) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 1
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 2

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 18.
For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<2, (10, 18, 15)>
<4, (6, 14, 19)>
<9, (3, 11, 14)>
<10, (2, 15, 18)>
<15, (10, 17, 18)>
<18, (2, 10, 8)>
