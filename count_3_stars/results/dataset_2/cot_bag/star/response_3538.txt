Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 8, 2
- Node 1: 6, 4, 3
- Node 2: 5, 7, 3, 8, 0
- Node 3: 7, 1, 2
- Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 0, 1
- Node 5: 9, 2, 4
- Node 6: 9, 1, 7
- Node 7: 6, 4, 0, 3, 2
- Node 8: 9, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 4, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets: [50]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (9, 4, 8)>
- <0, (9, 4, 2)>
- <0, (9, 7, 2)>
- <0, (9, 2, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 3, 8)>
- <2, (7, 3, 8)>
- <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- <4, (5, 0, 2)>
- <4, (9, 0, 2)>
- <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
