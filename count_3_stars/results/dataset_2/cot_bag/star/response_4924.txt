Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 19) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 13) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 7) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 2) (20, 28) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 18) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (17, 0) (17, 27) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 4) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 2) (4, 16) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 13) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 25) (24, 14) (24, 29) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ \text{Total} = \binom{30}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 73140 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [73140].

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 3, 27)>
- <2, (10, 16, 20)>
- <2, (11, 16, 27)>
- <2, (20, 27, 10)>
- <3, (2, 11, 27)>
- <6, (7, 10, 24)>
- <7, (6, 8, 25)>
- <8, (7, 10, 23)>
- <10, (6, 7, 24)>
- <13, (12, 15, 23)>
- <15, (0, 13, 23)>
- <16, (11, 19, 16)>
- <19, (4, 16, 23)>
- <20, (2, 21, 28)>
- <21, (18, 22, 26)>
- <22, (20, 21, 28)>
- <23, (13, 15, 19)>
- <24, (6, 10, 25)>
- <27, (2, 17, 25)>
