Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 4) (20, 29) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (11, 25) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 10) (6, 26) (6, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 6) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 24) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 5) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 23) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 28) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 4) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 24) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 24) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 6) (8, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 24) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 18) (24, 19) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify them first:  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors  

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed with these nodes:  
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].   

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<2, (17, 20, 23)>, <2, (17, 20, 25)>, <2, (17, 20, 24)>, <2, (20, 23, 25)>, <2, (20, 23, 24)>, <2, (23, 25, 24)>,  
<4, (21, 9, 28)>,  
<8, (17, 3, 25)>, <8, (17, 6, 25)>, <8, (17, 20, 25)>, <8, (3, 6, 25)>, <8, (3, 20, 25)>, <8, (6, 20, 25)>, <8, (20, 6, 25)>,  
<9, (0, 21, 4)>, <9, (0, 21, 28)>, <9, (0, 4, 28)>, <9, (21, 4, 28)>,  
<13, (17, 25, 23)>,  
<14, (22, 29, 24)>,  
<17, (2, 20, 23)>, <17, (2, 20, 25)>, <17, (2, 23, 25)>, <17, (20, 23, 25)>,  
<19, (0, 16, 24)>, <19, (0, 16, 28)>, <19, (0, 24, 28)>, <19, (16, 24, 28)>,  
<20, (2, 23, 10)>, <20, (2, 18, 24)>, <20, (23, 18, 24)>,  
<21, (27, 15, 26)>,  
<22, (5, 14, 29)>,  
<23, (2, 10, 18)>, <23, (2, 18, 24)>, <23, (10, 18, 24)>,  
<24, (14, 25, 18)>,
