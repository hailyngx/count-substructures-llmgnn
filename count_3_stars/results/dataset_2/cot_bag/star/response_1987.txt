Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 11) (7, 9) (16, 5) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
