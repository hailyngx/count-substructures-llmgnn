Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 4) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4:  \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7:  \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 107.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [107].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 10, 4)>, <3, (0, 14, 4)>, <4, (2, 5, 10)>, <5, (4, 10, 7)>, <6, (13, 12, 14)>, <7, (5, 11, 14)>, <9, (0, 7, 14)>, <11, (13, 3, 7)>, <12, (2, 9, 6)>, <13, (6, 11, 7)>, <14, (1, 5, 6)>
