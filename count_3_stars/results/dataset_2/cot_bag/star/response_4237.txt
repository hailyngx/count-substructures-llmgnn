Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 13, 14, 5, 7, 12, and 6. 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <1, (3, 6, 14)>, <1, (3, 10, 14)>, <1, (3, 10, 12)>, <1, (3, 10, 1)>, <1, (3, 14, 6)>, <1, (6, 14, 1)>, <1, (6, 3, 10)>, <1, (6, 14, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 1)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (1, 10, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 13)>, <3, (10, 13, 5)>, <3, (13, 5, 4)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <10, (1, 3, 13)>, <10, (1, 3, 14)>, <10, (1, 3, 10)>, <10, (1, 14, 5)>, <10, (3, 14, 7)>, <10, (3, 11, 13)>, <10, (3, 13, 5)>, <10, (11, 13, 5)>, <10, (11, 9, 13)>, <10, (13, 5, 4)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <11, (10, 13, 9)>, <11, (10, 13, 5)>, <11, (10, 9, 13)>, <11, (13, 5, 7)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <13, (10, 11, 9)>, <13, (10, 11, 7)>, <13, (10, 11, 5)>, <13, (10, 11, 13)>, <13, (10, 7, 5)>, <13, (10, 7, 2)>, <13, (10, 5, 7)>, <13, (10, 5, 4)>, <13, (7, 5, 2)>, <13, (7, 5, 4)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <14, (1, 3, 6)>, <14, (1, 6, 12)>, <14, (3, 6, 2)>, <14, (6, 13, 2)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <5, (13, 4, 7)>, <5, (13, 7, 2)>, <5, (13, 7, 8)>, <5, (13, 7, 14)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <7, (11, 8, 2)>, <7, (11, 8, 13)>, <7, (11, 8, 14)>, <7, (11, 8, 7)>, <7, (11, 9, 8)>, <7, (11, 9, 14)>, <7, (11, 9, 5)>, <7, (8, 14, 2)>, <7, (8, 14, 6)>, <7, (8, 14, 12)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <12, (1, 6, 14)>, <12, (6, 5, 4)>, <12, (6, 5, 13)>, <12, (6, 5, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <6, (1, 14, 2)>, <6, (1, 14, 12)>, <6, (14, 7, 2)>, <6, (14, 12, 2)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of [50] 3-stars in the graph.
