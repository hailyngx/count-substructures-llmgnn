Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (9, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 19) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 3) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 18) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 1, 8, 15, 12, 0, 10, 3, 2, 16, 13, 19, 18, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with this node.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with this node.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].
The unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 12, 18)>
<1, (2, 5, 15)>
<8, (4, 9, 15)>
<15, (1, 7, 12)>
<12, (4, 10, 15)>

<10, (0, 1, 12)>
<3, (4, 13, 19)>
<13, (3, 12, 19)>
<19, (7, 13, 18)>
<18, (6, 14, 19)>
<7, (15, 16, 19)>
