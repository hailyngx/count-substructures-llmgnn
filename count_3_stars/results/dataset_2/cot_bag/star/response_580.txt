Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by visualizing the graph based on the edges provided:

The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The edges are: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 0), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by them.

Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 8, 2
Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 7
Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 0
Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 2
Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 2, 1, 4, 0
Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 1, 7, 2
Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 6, 1, 4, 0
Node 9 has neighbors: 8, 3, 7, 0

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it has exactly 3 neighbors

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
