Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 5, 7, 1, 9, 4, and 0. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7. So, there are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 6, 7)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 3)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 3, 4. So, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (9, 2, 3)>, <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4. So, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 3, 1)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (3, 1, 4)>

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 9, 0, 3. So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>, <4, (1, 7, 3)>, <4, (1, 9, 0)>, <4, (1, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (1, 0, 3)>

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 2, 9. So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 2, 9)>, <0, (7, 2, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [39].
