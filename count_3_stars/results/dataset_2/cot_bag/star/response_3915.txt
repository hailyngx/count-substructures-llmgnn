Response:
There are 16 nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors, so we will check each of these nodes for the formation of 3-stars.

1. Node 1: It has neighbors 26, 13, 14, 5. Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.  
2. Node 3: It has neighbors 11, 20, 16, 19. Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.  
3. Node 4: It has neighbors 26, 18, 23. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
4. Node 5: It has neighbors 1, 18, 27, 28, 8. Therefore, it can form 5 3-stars.  
5. Node 7: It has neighbors 25, 11, 27, 8. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
6. Node 10: It has neighbors 22, 27, 25. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
7. Node 11: It has neighbors 7, 3, 6. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
8. Node 12: It has neighbors 21, 0, 25. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
9. Node 13: It has neighbors 29, 1, 19. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
10. Node 14: It has neighbors 6, 1, 25. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
11. Node 15: It has neighbors 26, 16, 8. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
12. Node 16: It has neighbors 3, 27, 15. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
13. Node 19: It has neighbors 13, 18, 3, 24, 23. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
14. Node 23: It has neighbors 17, 2, 4, 19, 6. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
15. Node 25: It has neighbors 14, 7, 12, 10. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  
16. Node 26: It has neighbors 9, 1, 15, 20, 4. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.  

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [25].
