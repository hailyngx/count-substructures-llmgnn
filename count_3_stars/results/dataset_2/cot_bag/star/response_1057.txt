Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 13) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 11) (27, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 23) (25, 4) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 18) (22, 6) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (24, 29) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 4) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 6) (1, 0) (1, 19) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (16, 0) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (23, 25) (23, 29) (21, 15) (21, 16) (21, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) (17, 7) (17, 28) (17, 19) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 17) (14, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (5, 20) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 14) (8, 27) (29, 15) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 23) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars together gives a total of [23] unique 3-stars:

<0, (15, 1, 16)>, <2, (6, 12, 24)>, <4, (25, 3, 5)>, <6, (22, 2, 4)>, <7, (17, 0, 19)>, <9, (13, 28, 9)>, <10, (3, 20, 11)>, <11, (10, 27, 24)>, <12, (18, 2, 27)>, <13, (9, 16, 13)>, <15, (0, 27, 21)>, <16, (18, 21, 19)>, <17, (28, 7, 19)>, <18, (12, 16, 20)>, <19, (14, 1, 16)>, <20, (10, 5, 18)>, <21, (16, 4, 15)>, <23, (29, 25, 23)>, <24, (29, 2, 11)>, <25, (28, 4, 23)>, <27, (8, 27, 15)>, <28, (17, 25, 9)>, <29, (23, 11, 24)>
