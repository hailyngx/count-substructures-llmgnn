Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 22) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 29) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 11) (23, 22) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 4) (20, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 13) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 27) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 29) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 16) (27, 6) (27, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 29) (24, 10) (24, 4) (29, 10) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 5) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29.

Now calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

List of unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 3, 15)>, <6, (22, 20, 28)>, <7, (21, 16, 0)>, <8, (0, 13, 25)>, <10, (1, 11, 29)>, <11, (10, 23, 28)>, <12, (7, 19, 14)>, <13, (0, 15, 8)>, <16, (21, 28, 18)>, <28, (3, 11, 12)>, <29, (10, 5, 25)>
