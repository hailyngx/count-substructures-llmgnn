Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
Since there are 15 nodes in the graph, we'll analyze each node to determine if it can be the center of a 3-star. The total number of 3-stars can be found by considering each node with at least 3 neighbors.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: We find that node 3 has 6 neighbors (5, 1, 0, 10, 6, 4), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: Node 4 has 6 neighbors (3, 13, 12, 0, 11, 6), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 12, 1, 3), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors (9, 12, 6, 10, 14), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 13, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 7, 12), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: Node 13 has 6 neighbors (8, 4, 2, 11, 0, 13), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 82 \)

So, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 0, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 12)>
<7, (9, 12, 6)>
<8, (9, 13, 1)>
<13, (8, 11, 0)>
