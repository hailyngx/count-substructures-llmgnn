Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 21) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 3) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 6) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 17) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 24) (8, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (28, 2) (28, 4) (10, 9) (15, 26) (15, 11) (4, 28) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 0) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (14, 25) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 27) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 24) (19, 1) (19, 27) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 24) (27, 19) (1, 19) (1, 23) (1, 0) (23, 21) (23, 1) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 6) (18, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (1, 2, 12)>
- <0, (1, 2, 27)>
- <0, (1, 3, 29)>

- <0, (1, 12, 27)>
- <0, (2, 3, 27)>
- <0, (2, 12, 20)>
- <0, (2, 12, 27)>
- <1, (0, 2, 12)>
- <1, (0, 2, 27)>
- <1, (0, 3, 29)>
- <1, (0, 12, 19)>
- <1, (0, 12, 27)>

- <27, (1, 19, 24)>
- <27, (2, 12, 20)>
