Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them:

- Node 0: Degree = 5
- Node 1: Degree = 4
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 3: Degree = 3
- Node 4: Degree = 3
- Node 5: Degree = 5
- Node 6: Degree = 5
- Node 7: Degree = 4
- Node 8: Degree = 5
- Node 9: Degree = 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (8, 9, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
