Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (2, 19) (2, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 29) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 21) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (29, 18) (29, 8) (25, 0) (25, 1) (27, 26) (27, 5) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 16) (11, 0) (11, 1) (24, 10) (24, 20) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 22) (17, 3) (1, 25) (1, 11) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 26) (16, 26) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 13) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 3) (12, 23) (12, 28) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 10) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 8) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine where 3-stars can be formed. Based on the edges given, nodes 4, 6, 21, 22, 23, and 28 have at least three neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the possible 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 24. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, 7, 15, 17>, <6, 22, 19, 21>, <6, 22, 6, 28>, <6, 22, 19, 0>, <6, 28, 21, 14>, <6, 28, 21, 5>, <21, 6, 28, 12>, <21, 6, 28, 10>, <22, 23, 22, 15>, <22, 23, 22, 17>, <22, 22, 6, 19>, <22, 22, 15, 26>, <23, 22, 23, 26>, <28, 6, 21, 14>, <28, 6, 21, 5>, <28, 6, 21, 20>, <28, 6, 21, 5>, <22, 15, 4, 7>, <22, 15, 18, 29>, <22, 17, 4, 7>, <22, 17, 3, 19>, <22, 17, 22, 15>, <22, 26, 15, 26>, <28, 12, 13, 19>, <8, 22, 29, 18>, <8, 22, 10, 24>, <10, 8, 29, 18>, <5, 18, 15, 26> 

So, the final result is [24].
