Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 18) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28 \)

Hence, the final number of 3-stars is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<5, (4, 9, 0)>
<6, (8, 15, 14)>
<7, (11, 17, 18)>
<8, (6, 15, 4)>
<9, (5, 17, 16)>
<10, (3, 14, 17)>
<11, (7, 13, 12)>
<13, (11, 4, 18)>
<14, (10, 6, 15)>
<15, (8, 6, 14)>
<17, (9, 10, 7)>
<18, (13, 19, 7)>
<19, (16, 18, 6)>
