Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 0, 7)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 2, 7)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (9, 7, 6, 2)
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 6, 8, 1)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (7, 3, 2, 8)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (9, 4, 1, 3, 0)
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 2, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (7, 1, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
