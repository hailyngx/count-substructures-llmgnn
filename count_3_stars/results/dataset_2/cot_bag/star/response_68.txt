Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 13, 5, 6, 2, 11, 9, 12, 14, and 10.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes gives: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 =  72 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [72]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (7, 9, 11)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 9, 13)>
<3, (1, 9, 11)>
<13, (1, 11, 10)>
<5, (8, 0, 12)>
<6, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (7, 10, 12)>
<11, (7, 3, 13)>
<9, (4, 1, 11)>
<12, (1, 5, 10)>
<14, (5, 10, 11)>
<10, (8, 12, 14)>
