Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.   
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 51 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [51].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 7, 5>  
<0, 12, 2>  
<0, 12, 8>  
<0, 8, 12>  
<5, 0, 7>  
<5, 7, 0>  
<7, 0, 5>  
<7, 0, 14>  
<7, 5, 0>  
<8, 0, 12>  
<10, 1, 13>  
<10, 13, 1>  
<11, 2, 12>  
<11, 4, 1>
