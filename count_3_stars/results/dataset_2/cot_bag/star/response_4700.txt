Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes have the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 2 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 15 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form 6 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 can form 10 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 83 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [83].
