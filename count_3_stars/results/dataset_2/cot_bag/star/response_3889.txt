Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 8 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 56 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 115 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [115]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 14)>
<1, (4, 7, 13)>
<2, (0, 3, 14)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<5, (10, 11, 12)>
<6, (3, 9, 13)>
<7, (1, 4, 13)>
<8, (2, 11, 13)>
<9, (3, 6, 14)>
<10, (5, 7, 12)>
<11, (2, 3, 14)>
<12, (5, 7, 10)>
<13, (1, 4, 7)>
<14, (3, 6, 9)>
