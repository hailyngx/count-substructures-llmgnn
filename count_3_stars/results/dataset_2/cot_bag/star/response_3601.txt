Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (15, 20) (15, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 20) (29, 4) (4, 29) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 3) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 11) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (24, 26) (24, 20) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (25, 18) (28, 17) (28, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 27) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 22) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 16) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 3) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 0) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 16) (10, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0: (1, 4, 14, 21)
- Node 2: (6, 19, 20)
- Node 4: (0, 10, 18, 29)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 12, 27)
- Node 8: (3, 16, 27)
- Node 12: (6, 14, 16, 17)
- Node 14: (0, 5, 13)
- Node 16: (7, 8, 12, 18, 22, 27)
- Node 17: (11, 12, 23, 28)
- Node 18: (4, 16, 25)
- Node 19: (2, 12, 13, 26)
- Node 20: (2, 5, 15, 24)
- Node 21: (0, 15, 27)
- Node 22: (7, 16, 27)
- Node 24: (20, 26)
- Node 27: (6, 8, 16, 21, 22)

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 2 3-stars
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{2} \)

Adding these up: 2 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 20 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, 1, 4, 21>
<0, 4, 10, 18>
<2, 6, 12, 19>
<2, 6, 19, 20>
<6, 12, 14, 16>
<7, 16, 22, 27>
<12, 16, 17, 19>
<16, 18, 25, 27>
<20, 21, 24, 27>
