Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 76 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 11)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 10)>, 
<4, (6, 10, 11)>, 
<5, (9, 13, 14)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 10)>, 
<8, (0, 12, 13)>, 
<10, (4, 6, 14)>, 
<11, (1, 4, 14)>, 
<12, (0, 3, 13)>, 
<13, (5, 10, 12)>, 
<14, (5, 6, 11)>.
