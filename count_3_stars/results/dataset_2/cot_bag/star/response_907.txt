Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 5) (16, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 13, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [56].

Some unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 6, 16>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 1, 4>
<10, 8, 13>
<13, 3, 5>
<18, 13, 2>
<19, 1, 5>
