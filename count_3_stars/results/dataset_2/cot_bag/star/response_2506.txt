Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 10, 11, 14)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (3, 10, 14)>, <1, (3, 11, 14)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 14)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 14)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 14)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 14)>, <3, (2, 9, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 14)>, <3, (4, 9, 14)>, <3, (6, 9, 14)>, <3, (1, 4, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 14)>, <3, (4, 9, 14)>

- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (1, 9, 11, 13, 14)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-star: <10, (1, 9, 11)>, <10, (1, 9, 13)>, <10, (1, 9, 14)>, <10, (1, 11, 13)>, <10, (1, 11, 14)>, <10, (1, 13, 14)>, <10, (9, 11, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 14)>, <10, (9, 13, 14)>, <10, (11, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 20 + 10 = 34.

Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us [34].
