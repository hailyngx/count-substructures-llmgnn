Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 18) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 15) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 5) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 9) (19, 15) (3, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 15) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 18) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 15, 16, and 17. 
For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars.

So the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (8, 15, 19)>, <0, (15, 16, 17)>, <0, (8, 15, 17)>, <0, (8, 15, 2)>, <4, (6, 11, 17)>, <4, (8, 6, 17)>, <4, (8, 6, 18)>, <4, (6, 14, 17)>, <6, (4, 8, 17)>, <6, (11, 17, 4)>, <6, (14, 1, 5)>, <6, (14, 15, 1)>, <8, (0, 18, 6)>, <8, (0, 18, 5)>, <8, (0, 18, 8)>, <8, (18, 15, 19)>, <8, (18, 6, 0)>, <8, (18, 6, 17)>, <8, (18, 5, 12)>, <8, (18, 5, 1)>, <15, (0, 16, 15)>, <15, (16, 2, 15)>, <15, (16, 0, 15)>, <15, (16, 7, 9)>, <15, (16, 7, 0)>, <16, (7, 9, 15)>, <16, (7, 0, 15)>, <16, (0, 15, 3)>, <16, (0, 15, 5)>, <17, (4, 8, 6)>, <17, (4, 8, 10)>, <17, (8, 10, 2)>, <17, (8, 6, 4)>, <17, (8, 6, 18)>
