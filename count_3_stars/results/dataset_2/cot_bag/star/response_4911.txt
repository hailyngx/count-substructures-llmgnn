Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: 
    - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 10, 13.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (9, 10, 13)>

2. Node 2: 
    - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 13, 11.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (9, 14, 13)>

3. Node 4: 
    - Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 10, 1, 11.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (6, 10, 13)>, <4, (6, 11, 13)>, <4, (1, 10, 11)>

4. Node 9: 
    - Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 10, 13, 0, 12.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 10, 13)>, <9, (0, 10, 12)>, <9, (0, 13, 12)>

5. Node 10: 
    - Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 9, 0, 8, 4, 3.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <10, (9, 0, 8)>, <10, (9, 4, 3)>, <10, (0, 4, 3)>

6. Node 11: 
    - Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 12, 4, 1.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <11, (6, 12, 2)>, <11, (4, 1, 6)>, <11, (4, 1, 12)>

7. Node 13: 
    - Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 14, 2, 4, 3.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <13, (5, 9, 14)>, <13, (5, 9, 2)>, <13, (5, 14, 2)>

8. Node 14: 
    - Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 2, 13.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <14, (0, 7, 13)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].
