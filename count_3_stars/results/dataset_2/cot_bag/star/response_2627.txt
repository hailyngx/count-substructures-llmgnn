Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 28) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 17) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 16) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 24) (18, 15) (18, 23) (18, 13) (29, 27) (29, 0) (29, 24) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (5, 7) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 24) (22, 19) (22, 7) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 22) (28, 27) (28, 25) (28, 8) (12, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 21) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (1, 27) (1, 20) (20, 14) (20, 1) (0, 8) (0, 29) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 21) (11, 15) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 15, 27, 6, 9, 3, 10, 17, 8, 23, 4, 18, 29, 14, 26, 5, 2, 22, 19, 28, 16, 7, 13, 21, 24, 11, and 0.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get: 35 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, 15, 18>, <1, 15, 27>, <3, 6, 16>, <4, 10, 17>, <6, 9, 19>, <7, 13, 21>, <8, 18, 23>, <14, 20, 26>, <15, 4, 10>, <15, 11, 26>, <27, 1, 20>, <27, 1, 29>>.
