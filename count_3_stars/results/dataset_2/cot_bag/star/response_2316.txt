Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 11, 12, 14
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 3, 9, 10, 14, 8, 10
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 11, 13
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 10, 13
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 12, 14, 2
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 11, 2, 14
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 12
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 9, 11, 14

For the nodes listed above, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 99 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [99].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (0, 2, 5)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>, <10, (5, 11, 14)>, <11, (3, 9, 14)>, <11, (9, 8, 11)>, <8, (1, 6, 13)>, <13, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 10)>, <5, (3, 4, 13)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <2, (4, 12, 14)>, <14, (9, 10, 11)>, <14, (10, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 8, 12)>, <9, (3, 4, 14)>, <9, (4, 11, 14)>
