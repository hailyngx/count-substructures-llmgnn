Response:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 15}
- Node 1: {14, 23, 25}
- Node 2: {11, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {13, 17, 23, 26}
- Node 4: {20, 23}
- Node 5: {10, 29}
- Node 6: {10}
- Node 7: {0, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 18, 24, 28}
- Node 9: {19, 24, 26}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 19}
- Node 11: {2}
- Node 12: {21, 24, 29}
- Node 13: {3, 16, 26}
- Node 14: {1, 17, 28}
- Node 15: {0, 15, 19, 22, 26}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 26, 29}
- Node 17: {3, 14, 24, 28}
- Node 18: {8, 25}
- Node 19: {9, 10, 15}
- Node 20: {2, 4}
- Node 21: {12, 22, 24}
- Node 22: {15, 21}
- Node 23: {1, 3, 4, 25}
- Node 24: {8, 12, 17, 21}
- Node 25: {1, 2, 23}
- Node 26: {3, 9, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 27: {3}
- Node 28: {8, 14, 17}
- Node 29: {5, 12, 16}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [0]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [2]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [0]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [0]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [0]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [1]
- Node 18: [0]
- Node 19: [0]
- Node 20: [0]
- Node 21: [0]
- Node 22: [0]
- Node 23: [3]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 25: [0]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [0]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <3, (13, 16, 26)>
- <3, (13, 17, 28)>
- <3, (13, 23, 25)>
- <12, (21, 24, 29)>
- <13, (3, 16, 26)>
- <16, (7, 13, 26)>
- <17, (3, 14, 28)>
- <24, (8, 17, 28)>
- <23, (1, 3, 25)>
- <24, (12, 21, 29)>
- <23, (3, 4, 25)>
- <24, (17, 21, 28)>
- <24, (17, 24, 28)>
