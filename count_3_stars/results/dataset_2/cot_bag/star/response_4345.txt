Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 18) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 17) (18, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {10, 7, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 19, 12}
- Node 2: {13, 4, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 2, 15}
- Node 5: {16, 8, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 15}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {16, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {10, 8, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 19, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 17, 2}
- Node 12: {16, 1, 7}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 2}
- Node 15: {17, 9, 4, 6}
- Node 16: {12, 8, 5}
- Node 17: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 0}
- Node 19: {1, 10, 2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

In which nodes have 3 or more neighbors?
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 19
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20, which can be represented as [20].

Unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 19, 12)>
- <2, (4, 13, 11)>
- <19, (1, 5, 10)>
- <4, (1, 15, 11)>
- <7, (0, 12, 13)>
- <8, (5, 16, 9)>
- <9, (8, 10, 15)>
- <10, (0, 19, 9)>
- <12, (1, 16, 7)>
- <15, (17, 9, 4)>
- <16, (12, 8, 5)>
