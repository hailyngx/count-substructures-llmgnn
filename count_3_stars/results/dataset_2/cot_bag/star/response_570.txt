Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3

Applying the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [62].
