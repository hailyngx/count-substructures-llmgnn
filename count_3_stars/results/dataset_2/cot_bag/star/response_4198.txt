Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 7) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 1 neighbor, 3 nodes with 2 neighbors, and 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's focus on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 5: There are 3 edges connecting node 5 to nodes 9, 4, and 10. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 4, 10)>.

2. For node 9: There are 4 edges connecting node 9 to nodes 5, 8, 4, and 7. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>.

3. For node 4: There are 5 edges connecting node 4 to nodes 5, 9, 10, 14, and 11. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (5, 9, 10)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <4, (5, 10, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 11)>, <4, (9, 10, 14)>, <4, (9, 10, 11)>, <4, (5, 14, 11)>, <4, (9, 14, 11)>, <4, (10, 14, 11)>.

4. For node 7: There are 4 edges connecting node 7 to nodes 9, 6, 14, and 13. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 6, 14)>, <7, (9, 6, 13)>, <7, (9, 14, 13)>, <7, (6, 14, 13)>.

5. For node 8: There are 5 edges connecting node 8 to nodes 9, 13, 11, 3, and 1. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (9, 13, 11)>, <8, (9, 13, 3)>, <8, (9, 13, 1)>, <8, (9, 11, 3)>, <8, (9, 11, 1)>, <8, (13, 11, 3)>, <8, (13, 11, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 1)>, <8, (13, 3, 1)>, <8, (11, 3, 1)>.

6. For node 10: There are 4 edges connecting node 10 to nodes 5, 4, 3, and 12. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (5, 4, 3)>, <10, (5, 4, 12)>, <10, (5, 3, 12)>, <10, (4, 3, 12)>.

Adding all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of 29 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is [29].
