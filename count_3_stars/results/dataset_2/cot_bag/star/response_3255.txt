Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9, 5
- Node 1: 6, 4, 8
- Node 2: 6, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7, 2, 4
- Node 4: 9, 1, 3, 7, 5
- Node 5: 6, 4, 0
- Node 6: 9, 5, 1, 2, 0
- Node 7: 9, 3, 4, 2
- Node 8: 9, 1, 2, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 7, 4, 0

Let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (9, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 0 forms 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 11.
The unique 3-stars found are: <<6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 7)>, <7, (9, 3, 4)>].
