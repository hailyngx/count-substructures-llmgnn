Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4:  inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 85 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [85].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 10)>
<0, (3, 6, 12)>
<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<0, (6, 10, 12)>
<3, (0, 6, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 11)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 11)>
<4, (6, 7, 13)>
<6, (0, 1, 10)>
<6, (3, 7, 11)>
<6, (3, 8, 13)>
<6, (5, 7, 12)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<10, (6, 9, 12)>
