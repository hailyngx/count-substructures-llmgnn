Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 6 and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 6, there are 4 possible 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 8, there are 10 possible 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 8) = 14.

So, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [14].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 3, 0)>
<8, (6, 3, 2)>
<8, (6, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (6, 0, 5)>
<8, (3, 0, 5)>
<8, (3, 7, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 0)>
<8, (3, 5, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 14, and the unique 3-stars found are listed above.
