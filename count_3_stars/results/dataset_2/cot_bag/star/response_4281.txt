Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
\[ \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
