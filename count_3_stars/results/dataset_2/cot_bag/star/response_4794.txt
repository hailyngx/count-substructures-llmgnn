Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 15) (11, 10) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 13) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 16) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars = sum of [inom{degree}{3}] for nodes with degree >= 3
= [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}]
= 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4
= 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 10, 11)>
<4, (3, 9, 19)>
<6, (2, 9, 12)>
<9, (4, 6, 13)>
<10, (1, 17, 19)>
<12, (0, 2, 8)>
<13, (9, 14, 19)>
<14, (3, 13, 19)>
<16, (8, 17, 18)>
<18, (0, 16, 1)>
<19, (4, 10, 13)>
