Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-star configurations for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 40 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 11)>
<12, (0, 3, 13)>
<13, (14, 19, 12)>
<14, (7, 9, 13)>
<15, (0, 11, 17)>
<16, (2, 8, 10)>
<19, (5, 11, 13)>
