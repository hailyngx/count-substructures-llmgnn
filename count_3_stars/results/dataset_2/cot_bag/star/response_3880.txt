Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 7, node 8, and node 9.

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8)
For <4, (0, 2, 5)> there's 1 3-star.
So, for node 4, there is 1 3-star.

For node 7:
There are 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8)
For <7, (1, 5, 6)> there's 1 3-star.
So, for node 7, there is 1 3-star.

For node 8:
There are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5, 7)
For <8, (0, 2, 4)> there's 1 3-star.
For <8, (5, 7, 9)> there's 1 3-star.
So, for node 8, there are 2 3-stars.

For node 9:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8)
For <9, (0, 2, 8)> there's 1 3-star.
So, for node 9, there is 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
