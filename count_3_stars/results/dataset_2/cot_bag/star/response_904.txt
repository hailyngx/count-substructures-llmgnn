Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (6, 12) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (13, 19) (13, 16) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 44 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 10)>, <2, (14, 16, 18)>, <3, (0, 11, 5)>, <5, (2, 11, 19)>, <8, (3, 6, 10)>, <10, (0, 8, 18)>, <11, (2, 5, 9)>, <14, (1, 16, 18)>, <16, (2, 13, 14)>, <18, (10, 14, 19)>, <19, (4, 5, 13)>
