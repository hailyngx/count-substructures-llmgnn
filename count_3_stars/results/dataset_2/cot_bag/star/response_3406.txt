Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 8) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (3, 14) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 42 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 5, 19)>, 
<0, (4, 8, 11)>,

<8, (0, 4, 11)>,

<19, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<19, (2, 5, 10)>.
