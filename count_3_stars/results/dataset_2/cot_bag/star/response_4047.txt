Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 8), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 0), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 2), (4, 0)]

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (2, 0, 3, 7) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (6, 8, 4, 7) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (9, 1, 8, 4) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (6, 7) => 0 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (5, 0, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (5, 8, 4, 7, 0) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (9, 6, 3, 2, 7) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9, 1, 2, 8) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (5, 3, 2, 4) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (9, 6, 2, 0) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47]. The unique 3-stars are: <5, (2, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 0, 8)>, <8, (9, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <0, (5, 2, 4)>, <0, (5, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 0)>.
