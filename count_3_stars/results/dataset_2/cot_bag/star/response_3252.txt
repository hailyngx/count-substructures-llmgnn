Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 16) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (17, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 9, 11, 3, 13
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 12, 14, 5, 16
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 10, 3, 0, 13
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 12, 3, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 7, 18, 19, 16
- Node 10 has neighbors: 6, 11, 15
- Node 12 has neighbors: 7, 18, 1, 19
- Node 16 has neighbors: 8, 19, 1
- Node 19 has neighbors: 4, 12, 8, 16

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is \[44\]  and the unique 3-stars found are:
