Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 4, and 7. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 52 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
