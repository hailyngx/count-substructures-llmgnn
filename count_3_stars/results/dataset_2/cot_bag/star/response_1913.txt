Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 8) (17, 2) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 29) (8, 17) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 9) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 19) (26, 25) (15, 7) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 15) (28, 24) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 16) (29, 3) (29, 27) (29, 6) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 27) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 16) (22, 14) (22, 8) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 25) (16, 24) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 4) (27, 21) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 18) (0, 23) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 0) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars they can form:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
16. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
17. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
18. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
19. Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
20. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
21. Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
22. Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
23. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
24. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we found for each node, we get a total of \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 72 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 23, 21)>, <2, (14, 17, 22)>, <3, (1, 29, 10)>, <5, (11, 21, 15)>, <6, (27, 23, 29)>, <7, (18, 12, 25)>, <8, (17, 25, 22)>, <10, (13, 9, 3)>, <11, (21, 5, 15)>, <13, (16, 10, 9)>, <14, (2, 17, 22)>, <15, (11, 5, 7)>, <16, (24, 18, 25)>, <17, (23, 14, 8)>, <18, (0, 7, 16)>, <19, (5, 26, 21)>, <21, (1, 11, 27)>, <22, (8, 14, 2)>, <23, (6, 0, 27)>, <24, (28, 5, 16)>, <25, (8, 16, 7)>, <27, (21, 6, 29)>, <29, (3, 6, 27)>.
