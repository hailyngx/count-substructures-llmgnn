Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 with neighbors {5, 17, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 4 with neighbors {13, 11, 15}
- Node 6 with neighbors {1, 16, 11, 8}
- Node 8 with neighbors {14, 7, 18, 6, 11}
- Node 9 with neighbors {17, 14, 0, 12}
- Node 12 with neighbors {5, 9, 18, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [33].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 17, 3)>
- <1, (5, 17, 6)>
- <1, (5, 17, 2)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <1, (5, 3, 2)>
- <1, (17, 3, 6)>
- <1, (17, 3, 2)>
- <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- <4, (13, 11, 15)>
- <6, (16, 11, 8)>
- <8, (14, 7, 18)>
- <8, (14, 7, 6)>
- <8, (14, 18, 6)>
- <8, (7, 18, 6)>
- <9, (17, 0, 12)>
- <9, (14, 0, 12)>
- <9, (17, 14, 12)>
- <9, (0, 14, 12)>
- <12, (5, 9, 10)>
- <12, (5, 9, 18)>
- <12, (5, 9, 10)>
- <12, (18, 9, 10)>
