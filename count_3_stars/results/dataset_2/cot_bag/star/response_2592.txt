Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {9, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 8: {9, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {6, 9, 8, 0}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = [39]

Unique 3-stars:
