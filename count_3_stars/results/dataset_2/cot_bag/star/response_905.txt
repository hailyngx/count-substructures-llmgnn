Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6 (has 5 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <6, (9, 5, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 0, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (8, 7, 9)>

2. Node 9 (has 5 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>

3. Node 1 (has 6 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    <1, (9, 3, 5)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (9, 5, 7)>, <1, (9, 5, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (8, 7, 0)>

4. Node 3 (has 3 neighbors):
    Only 1 3-star with node 3 as the central node: <3, (9, 1, 0)>

5. Node 5 (has 4 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>

6. Node 0 (has 3 neighbors):
    Only 1 3-star with node 0 as the central node: <0, (6, 3, 7)>

7. Node 2 (has 4 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>

8. Node 7 (has 5 neighbors):
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <7, (9, 1, 5)>, <7, (9, 1, 0)>, <7, (9, 5, 2)>, <7, (9, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 0)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (8, 2, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 60.
