Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 2, 14, 4
- Node 1: 7, 11, 2, 10, 13
- Node 2: 1, 0, 12
- Node 3: 0, 10, 13, 9, 5
- Node 4: 12, 13, 0
- Node 5: 3, 13, 11
- Node 6: 9, 14, 12, 8
- Node 7: 14, 9, 1
- Node 8: 6, 9, 10, 11
- Node 9: 7, 3, 6, 8, 14
- Node 10: 1, 3, 8
- Node 11: 1, 5, 8, 12
- Node 12: 4, 6, 2, 11
- Node 13: 4, 1, 3, 5, 14
- Node 14: 7, 6, 9, 0, 13

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

So, there are a total of 58 3-stars in the given graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, 2, 14>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 10, 13>
<1, 11, 13>
<1, 10, 11>
<1, 10, 13>
<3, 5, 13>
<3, 9, 13>
<3, 10, 13>
<3, 9, 13>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 14>
<9, 13, 14>
<9, 13, 14>
<9, 13, 14> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58, and the unique 3-stars are <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 11, 13>, <1, 10, 11>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 9, 13>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 14>, <9, 13, 14>.
