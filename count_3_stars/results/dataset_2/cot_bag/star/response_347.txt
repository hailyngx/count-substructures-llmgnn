Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (8, 13, 10, 6, 1) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (5, 9, 14, 0) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 13, 12) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (7, 6, 14) -> 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (7, 8, 13, 6, 2) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (9, 6, 13, 2, 1) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (5, 4, 12, 3, 0) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (4, 3, 14) -> 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (4, 13, 0, 12) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (5, 1, 13) -> 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (11, 0, 14) -> 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (8, 11, 2, 6) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9, 4, 8, 2, 0) -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (7, 10, 3, 1) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 70 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [70]. Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 12, 13)>
- <3, (6, 7, 14)>
- <4, (5, 8, 13)>
- <5, (1, 9, 13)>
- <6, (0, 4, 12)>
- <7, (3, 14, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 13)>
- <9, (1, 5, 13)>
- <10, (0, 14, 11)>
- <12, (2, 6, 8)>
- <13, (4, 8, 0)>
- <14, (1, 3, 7)>
