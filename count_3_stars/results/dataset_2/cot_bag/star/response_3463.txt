Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 23) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 24) (0, 15) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 17) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 20) (13, 17) (26, 18) (21, 22) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 17) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (17, 27) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 11) (14, 20) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 24) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 28) (16, 22) (16, 1) (10, 27) (25, 8) (25, 4) (4, 25) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node that has three or more neighbors. 

For node 5, which has 4 neighbors (9, 18, 1, 29), there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars. 
<5, (9, 18, 1)>, <5, (9, 18, 29)>, <5, (9, 1, 29)>, <5, (18, 1, 29)>

For node 9, which has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 2, 23), there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
<9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 23)>, <9, (5, 2, 23)>, <9, (6, 2, 23)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

For node 18, which has 4 neighbors (5, 22, 26, 20), there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
<18, (5, 22, 26)>, <18, (5, 22, 20)>, <18, (5, 26, 20)>, <18, (22, 26, 20)>

For node 22, which has 4 neighbors (18, 11, 16, 21), there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
<22, (18, 11, 16)>, <22, (18, 11, 21)>, <22, (18, 16, 21)>, <22, (11, 16, 21)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 15 has 4 neighbors, but no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

For node 20, which has 4 neighbors (18, 15, 13, 14), there are 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
<20, (18, 15, 13)>, <20, (18, 15, 14)>, <20, (18, 13, 14)>, <20, (15, 13, 14)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with this node.

For node 2, which has 3 neighbors (9, 12, 8), there is 3 choose 3 = 1 possible 3-star.
<2, (9, 12, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, but no 3-star is formed with this node.

For node 13, which has 3 neighbors (20, 17, 14), there is 3 choose 3 = 1 possible 3-star. 
<13, (20, 17, 14)>

...and so on for the other nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of all these possibilities. This sum will be inside brackets [].
