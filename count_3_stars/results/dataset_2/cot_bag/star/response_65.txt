Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 55

So, the total number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are:
<0, (8, 16, 4)>
<1, (4, 13, 6)>
<3, (2, 15, 13)>
<4, (0, 19, 16)>
<6, (1, 16, 13)>
<10, (17, 6, 9)>
<11, (7, 12, 19)>
<12, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (14, 6, 3)>
<14, (13, 18, 8)>
<15, (17, 2, 16)>
<16, (8, 4, 15)>
<17, (10, 15, 3)>
<19, (11, 4, 16)>
