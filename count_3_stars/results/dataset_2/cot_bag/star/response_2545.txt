Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, and node 13 has 4 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<5, (6, 0, 7)>, 
<5, (6, 7, 14)>, 
<5, (6, 14, 2)>, 
<5, (6, 2, 0)>, 
<5, (6, 14, 4)>, 
<6, (5, 9, 12)>, 
<6, (5, 9, 1)>, 
<6, (5, 1, 10)>, 
<6, (5, 1, 13)>, 
<6, (9, 3, 12)>, 
<6, (9, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (9, 7, 11)>, 
<6, (9, 7, 0)>, 
<13, (1, 10, 4)>, 
<13, (1, 10, 2)>, 
<13, (1, 10, 14)>, 
<13, (1, 10, 11)>.
