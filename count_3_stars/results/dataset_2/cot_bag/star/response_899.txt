Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, and 8.  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<4, (5, 0, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 9)>
