Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (9, 15, 24)>
<12, (1, 5, 27)>
<15, (2, 5, 26)>
<18, (4, 13, 27)>
<21, (7, 14, 22)>
<23, (1, 15, 29)>
<4, (0, 8, 29)>
<8, (3, 7, 19)>
<19, (6, 8, 26)>
<3, (0, 25, 26)>
