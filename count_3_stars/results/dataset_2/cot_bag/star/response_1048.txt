Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 8 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 56 = 104 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars found is [104].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 0, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once.
