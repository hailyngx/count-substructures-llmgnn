Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 10) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 20) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 1) (2, 12) (6, 28) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (11, 28) (11, 17) (11, 24) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 26) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 26) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (22, 4) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 16) (13, 25) (13, 24) (26, 3) (26, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 23) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (25, 13) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 23) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 7) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 20) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each (1 for each of the 4 nodes)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each (4 for each of the 6 nodes)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each (10 for each of the 5 nodes)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4*1 + 6*4 + 5*10 = 4 + 24 + 50 = 78 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [78].
