Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
Node 0: 4, 11, 14, 6
Node 1: 3, 2, 5, 12
Node 2: 1, 8, 13, 12
Node 3: 4, 1, 13, 5
Node 4: 7, 0, 5, 3
Node 5: 4, 7, 1, 3
Node 6: 7, 8, 11, 0, 14
Node 7: 4, 6, 10, 9, 5
Node 8: 2, 10, 6
Node 9: 7, 11, 12
Node 10: 7, 8, 12
Node 11: 9, 0, 6
Node 12: 1, 13, 2, 14, 10, 9
Node 13: 3, 12, 2, 14
Node 14: 13, 0, 6, 12

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:
Node 4: [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 5: [4 choose 3] = 4
Node 7: [5 choose 3] = 10
Node 12: [6 choose 3] = 20
Node 13: [3 choose 3] = 1
Node 14: [4 choose 3] = 4

Summing these up, we get 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 43 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final result is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (7, 5, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (10, 8, 6)>
<12, (1, 2, 13)>
<12, (1, 13, 14)>
<12, (2, 13, 14)>
<12, (13, 14, 10)>
