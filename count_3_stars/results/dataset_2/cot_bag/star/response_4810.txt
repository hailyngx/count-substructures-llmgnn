Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 4) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 0) (1, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (6, 18) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 9, 8, 13, and 10.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 18, 2, and 17.
- Total 3-stars with node 9 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Unique 3-star with node 9: <9, (18, 2, 17)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 13, 11, and 17.
- Total 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Unique 3-star with node 8: <8, (13, 11, 17)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: 15 and 8 (already counted).
- Total 3-stars with node 13 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

For node 10:
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 11, 15, 4, and 19.
- Total 3-stars with node 10 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Unique 3-stars with node 10: <10, (11, 15, 4)>, <10, (11, 15, 19)>, <10, (11, 4, 19)>, <10, (15, 4, 19)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 6. 
So, the final answer is [6].
