Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 12) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 11) (14, 16) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 26) (23, 22) (23, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 6) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 9) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (6, 8) (6, 21) (6, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 27) (11, 5) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 4) (1, 18) (29, 8) (29, 1) (29, 4) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 3) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 5) (20, 1) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 1) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 24) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, let's identify them:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 13, 22, 27, 2, 8, 21, 28, 26, 0, 6, 25, 11, 1, 3, 19, 10, 18, 12, 5, 4

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed for each node.

Total 3-stars = (17 * 4) = 68

So, there are 68 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets gives us: [68]

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<13, (22, 26, 0)>
<22, (13, 23, 27)>
<27, (22, 18, 11)>
<2, (8, 21, 26)>
<8, (2, 28, 29)>
<21, (2, 28, 9)>
<28, (8, 21, 19)>
<26, (13, 17, 2)>
<0, (13, 2, 6)>
<6, (8, 21, 10)>
<25, (15, 17, 25)>
<11, (13, 27, 5)>
<1, (29, 20, 18)>
<3, (23, 19, 5)>
<19, (15, 28, 3)>
<10, (6, 12, 4)>
<18, (27, 17, 1)>
<12, (15, 24, 10)>
<5, (7, 11, 24)>
