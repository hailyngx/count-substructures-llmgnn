Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, there are 50 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 9, 4)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 5)>
<4, (9, 2, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 9)>
