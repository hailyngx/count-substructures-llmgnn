Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 22) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 14) (18, 22) (18, 24) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 1) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 20) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (13, 5) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 2) (20, 22) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 14) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (28, 24) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 29) (25, 18) (25, 27) (25, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 2) (6, 20) (6, 19) (24, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 14) (7, 9) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (9, 24) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 19) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 27) (2, 11) (4, 3) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 10) (23, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 74

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].    

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (10, 27, 3)>
- <3, (12, 20, 4)>
- <4, (3, 28, 23)>
- <5, (8, 17, 20)>
- <8, (10, 14, 15)>
- <10, (2, 8, 15)>
- <14, (8, 21, 26)>
- <16, (6, 19, 22)>
- <17, (2, 20, 5)>
- <18, (22, 24, 25)>
- <20, (3, 17, 22)>
- <21, (14, 29, 3)>
- <22, (16, 18, 20)>
- <24, (18, 28, 9)>
- <25, (16, 27, 18)>
- <26, (0, 14, 28)>
- <27, (2, 25, 28)>
- <28, (4, 24, 27)>
- <29, (14, 18, 21)>
