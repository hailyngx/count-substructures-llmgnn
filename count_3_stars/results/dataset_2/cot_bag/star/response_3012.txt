Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed.

From the given edges, we can determine the following degree sequence of the nodes:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 5

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with degrees 3 or more based on the formula given above.

For Node 0 and Node 8, we can form 1 3-star each.
For Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 8) + 10 * 4 = 41

So, there are [41] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 9, 16> 
<8, 6, 11>
<1, 3, 18>
<2, 17, 19>
<10, 0, 9>
<13, 11, 18>
<6, 1, 10>
<17, 13, 2>
<19, 10, 2>
<3, 1, 6>
<18, 15, 17>
<16, 0, 5>
<11, 19, 13>
