Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are four nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 12, and 13.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4.
- There are [4] 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 7, 13)>, <0, (6, 7, 12)>, <0, (6, 12, 13)>, <0, (7, 12, 13)>.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 12.
- There is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (10, 11, 12)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 10.
- There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose 3 neighbors out of 3.
- There is only 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (3, 4, 10)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4.
- There are [4] 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 13)>
- <0, (6, 7, 12)>
- <0, (6, 12, 13)>
- <0, (7, 12, 13)>
- <1, (10, 11, 12)>
- <2, (3, 4, 10)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
