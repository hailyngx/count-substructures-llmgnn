Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 1: has neighbors 3, 13, and 14
- Node 3: has neighbors 1, 4, and 9
- Node 4: has neighbors 2, 3, and 11
- Node 7: has neighbors 3, 6, and 10
- Node 8: has neighbors 0, 1, and 14
- Node 10: has neighbors 1, 5, and 9
- Node 12: has neighbors 0, 5, and 14
- Node 13: has neighbors 1, 2, and 12

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, we have a total of 8 unique 3-stars: 
\[ [8] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, 3, 13, 14>
2. <3, 1, 4, 9>
3. <4, 2, 3, 11>
4. <7, 3, 6, 10>
5. <8, 0, 1, 14>
6. <10, 1, 5, 9>
7. <12, 0, 5, 14>
8. <13, 1, 2, 12>
