Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (11, 2) (11, 5) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64, so there are 64 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the answer is [64].
