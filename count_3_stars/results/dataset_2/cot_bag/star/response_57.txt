Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 17)>
<1, (0, 6, 18)>
<2, (4, 9, 19)>
<3, (5, 7, 17)>
<4, (2, 10, 12)>
<5, (3, 13, 19)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<12, (4, 10, 0)>
<13, (1, 5, 18)>
<15, (3, 10, 18)>
<17, (0, 3, 19)>
<19, (2, 5, 17)>
