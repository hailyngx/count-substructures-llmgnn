Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 16) (18, 8) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (16, 17) (16, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors (8, 19, 11), so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <0, (8, 19, 11)>

For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (1, 8, 13, 15), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<3, (1, 8, 13)>, <3, (1, 8, 15)>, <3, (13, 8, 15)>, <3, (1, 13, 15)>

For node 5, there are 5 neighbors (6, 7, 11, 14, 18), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<5, (6, 7, 11)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (6, 11, 14)>, <5, (7, 11, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 18)>, <5, (6, 11, 18)>, <5, (6, 14, 18)>, <5, (7, 11, 18)>, <5, (7, 14, 18)>, <5, (11, 14, 18)>

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors (1, 5, 9, 12, 13), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 12)>, <7, (1, 5, 13)>, <7, (1, 9, 12)>, <7, (1, 9, 13)>, <7, (1, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 9, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <7, (5, 12, 13)>, <7, (9, 12, 13)>

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 18), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<8, (0, 3, 18)>, <8, (3, 4, 18)>, <8, (0, 4, 18)>, <8, (3, 4, 18)>

For node 10, there are 4 neighbors (6, 11, 15, 4), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<10, (6, 11, 15)>, <10, (6, 11, 4)>, <10, (6, 15, 4)>, <10, (11, 15, 4)>

For node 11, there are 5 neighbors (0, 5, 10, 12, 19), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<11, (0, 5, 19)>, <11, (0, 5, 12)>, <11, (0, 5, 10)>, <11, (0, 19, 12)>, <11, (0, 19, 10)>, <11, (0, 12, 10)>, <11, (5, 12, 19)>, <11, (5, 12, 10)>, <11, (5, 19, 10)>, <11, (12, 19, 10)>

For node 13, there are 3 neighbors (3, 7, 14), so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <13, (3, 7, 14)>

For node 14, there are 4 neighbors (5, 13, 17, 9), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<14, (5, 13, 17)>, <14, (5, 13, 9)>, <14, (5, 17, 9)>, <14, (13, 17, 9)>

For node 15, there are 4 neighbors (3, 10, 4, 15), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<15, (3, 4, 10)>, <15, (3, 4, 15)>, <15, (3, 10, 15)>, <15, (4, 10, 15)>

Adding the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of [48].
