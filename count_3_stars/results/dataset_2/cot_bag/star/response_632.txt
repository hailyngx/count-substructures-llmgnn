Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (8, 3), (8, 0), (8, 6), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 2), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0)  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 4 neighbors  
Node 1 has 5 neighbors  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
Node 3 has 6 neighbors  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors  
Node 7 has 7 neighbors  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)  
Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 35 + 4 = 87  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [87].  

List of unique 3-stars:   
<0, (7, 1, 9)>,   
<1, (3, 6, 9)>,   
<2, (1, 3, 6)>,   
<3, (1, 7, 9)>,   
<6, (1, 3, 5)>,   
<7, (0, 3, 6)>.
