Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 12) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using the given edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 1), (7, 12), (7, 2), (7, 13), (6, 5), (6, 12), (6, 13), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 10), (9, 1), (10, 4), (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 13), (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 0), (11, 8), (11, 2), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 2), (12, 1), (3, 11), (3, 5), (3, 14), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 5), (8, 3), (2, 7), (2, 11), (2, 5), (2, 12), (2, 14), (14, 9), (14, 3), (14, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), (1, 5), (1, 12), (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 10), (0, 4), (0, 11), (0, 5)

Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
0: 4, 11, 5
1: 4, 9, 5, 12
2: 7, 11, 5, 12, 14
3: 11, 5, 14, 8
4: 0, 10, 1
5: 6, 2, 8, 1, 0, 3
6: 5, 12, 13
7: 12, 2, 13
8: 9, 10, 11, 5, 3
9: 8, 14, 10, 1
10: 9, 4, 11, 8, 13
11: 10, 3, 0, 8, 2
12: 7, 6, 2, 1
13: 7, 6, 10
14: 9, 3, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

<5, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (9, 10, 3)>
<9, (8, 10, 1)>
<10, (9, 4, 13)>
