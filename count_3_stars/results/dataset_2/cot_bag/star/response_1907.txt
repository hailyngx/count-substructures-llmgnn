Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 5, 13, 8, 12, 0, 14, 6, 3, 1, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 86 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].
Unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (7, 1, 9)>
- <10, (3, 5, 14)>
- <11, (7, 12, 13)>
- <5, (0, 12, 14)>
