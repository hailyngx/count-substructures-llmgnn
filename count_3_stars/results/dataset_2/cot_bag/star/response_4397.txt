Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
Based on the information provided, we can first construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: (11, 0), (11, 18), (11, 8), (16, 7), (16, 3), (16, 5), (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 16), (7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 19), (7, 13), (14, 9), (14, 13), (17, 5), (17, 15), (12, 7), (12, 2), (12, 18), (12, 6), (0, 11), (0, 3), (1, 15), (1, 19), (1, 9), (5, 16), (5, 4), (5, 17), (19, 7), (19, 1), (15, 17), (15, 1), (15, 9), (2, 12), (3, 16), (3, 4), (3, 0), (9, 14), (9, 1), (9, 15), (9, 13), (10, 4), (10, 6), (10, 18), (6, 4), (6, 12), (6, 10), (18, 11), (18, 12), (18, 10), (18, 13), (13, 7), (13, 14), (13, 9), (13, 18), (8, 11)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (7, 3, 10)>, <4, (7, 6, 12)>, <4, (10, 6, 12)>, <4, (4, 3, 16)>, <5, (16, 17, 15)>, <7, (16, 5, 17)>, <7, (16, 4, 5)>, <7, (19, 1, 9)>, <9, (15, 17, 14)>, <13, (7, 14, 9)>, <13, (14, 18, 9)>, <13, (14, 18, 7)>, <13, (14, 18, 10)>, <18, (11, 12, 10)>, <18, (11, 10, 13)>
