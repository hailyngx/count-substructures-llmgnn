Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 16) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 1) (16, 17) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 18) (12, 6) (12, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \(C(5, 3) = 10\)  
For node 2: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)  
For node 3: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 5: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 6: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 7: \(C(5, 3) = 10\)  
For node 9: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 10: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)  
For node 11: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 14: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 15: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  
For node 17: \(C(5, 3) = 10\)  
For node 18: \(C(4, 3) = 4\)  
For node 19: \(C(3, 3) = 1\)  

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 44\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (11, 16, 17)>  
<2, (6, 10, 11)>  
<7, (0, 5, 17)>  
<7, (5, 10, 17)>  
<10, (2, 5, 7)>  
<17, (0, 1, 7)>  
<17, (1, 16, 7)>  
<17, (8, 16, 1)>  
<18, (13, 15, 4)>
