Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 4) (8, 6) (8, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 12) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 19

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (3-stars: <3, (15, 9, 12)>, <3, (15, 9, 6)>, <3, (15, 12, 19)>, <3, (9, 6, 12)>)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (3-star: <4, (16, 17, 10)>)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (3-stars: <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 13)>, <9, (2, 7, 17)>, <9, (6, 7, 13)>)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (3-stars: <10, (15, 13, 8)>, <10, (15, 13, 4)>, <10, (13, 8, 6)>, <10, (13, 8, 4)>)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (3-star: <14, (16, 19, 5)>)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (3-stars: <15, (11, 3, 10)>, <15, (11, 3, 13)>, <15, (3, 10, 13)>, <15, (10, 13, 7)>)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (3-stars: <19, (0, 14, 12)>, <19, (0, 14, 17)>, <19, (7, 17, 2)>, <19, (12, 4, 0)>)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 22
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
