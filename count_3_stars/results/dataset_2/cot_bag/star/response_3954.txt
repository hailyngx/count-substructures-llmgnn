Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 11) (14, 15) (14, 17) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 12) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to identify the 3-star patterns.

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {11, 19, 13, 6, 0}. So, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These include: <0, (11, 13, 19)>, <0, (11, 13, 6)>, and so on up to 10 unique 3-stars formed with node 0.

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {18, 8, 7, 11}. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These include: <2, (18, 8, 7)>, and so on up to 4 unique 3-stars formed with node 2.

3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {18, 13, 16}. It forms 1 3-star: <4, (18, 13, 16)>.

4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {1, 0, 12}. It forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 0, 12)>.

5. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {17, 10, 19}. It forms 1 3-star: <9, (17, 10, 19)>.

Adding all the unique 3-stars:
[10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [17]
