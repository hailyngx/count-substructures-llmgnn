Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 16) (7, 16) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 11) (8, 17) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 1, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 11, and 15.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 7 and 16.
So, node 1 contributes 2 3-stars.

For node 11:
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes 1 and 17.
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 18, and 11.
So, node 11 contributes 3 3-stars.

For node 13:
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 13, and 18.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 13, and 18.
So, node 13 contributes 2 3-stars.

For node 14:
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 14, and 18.
So, node 14 contributes 1 3-star.

For node 16:
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 16, and 17.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 16, and 19.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 16, and 1.
So, node 16 contributes 3 3-stars.

For node 17:
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 17, and 18.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 17, and 1.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 8.
So, node 17 contributes 3 3-stars.

For node 18:
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 18, and 13.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 18, and 6.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 18, and 8.
So, node 18 contributes 3 3-stars.

For node 19:
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 19, and 10.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 19, and 0.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 16, and 10.
So, node 19 contributes 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 20.

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<1, 2, 11, 15>, <1, 7, 16, 11>, <11, 5, 7, 9>, <13, 12, 13, 18>, <13, 0, 13, 18>, <14, 6, 14, 18>, <16, 7, 16, 17>, <16, 10, 16, 19>, <16, 15, 16, 1>, <17, 8, 17, 18>, <17, 11, 17, 1>, <17, 16, 17, 8>, <18, 9, 18, 13>, <18, 14, 18, 6>, <18, 17, 18, 8>, <19, 4, 19, 10>, <19, 15, 19, 0>, <19, 19, 16, 10>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars can be written as [20].
