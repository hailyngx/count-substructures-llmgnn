Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 16) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 3) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 19) (2, 9) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 2) (13, 17) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 9) (18, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 46.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (11, 17, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (0, 19, 4)>, <9, (12, 14, 9)>, <10, (10, 15, 11)>, <15, (7, 15, 16)>, <16, (12, 16, 17)>, <17, (0, 13, 17)>, <19, (2, 4, 19)>. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [46].
