Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 24) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 24) (9, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 11) (1, 26) (1, 27) (1, 8) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 14) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 19) (29, 24) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 4) (3, 27) (19, 29) (19, 27) (14, 26) (14, 28) (11, 20) (11, 4) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 18) (25, 23) (25, 16) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 24) (15, 2) (17, 23) (17, 28) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 16) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 15) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 27) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 29) (24, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors

Calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3}
\]

After calculating the values, we find there are 97 total 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [97].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (0, 15, 23)>
- <8, (1, 16, 27)>
- <25, (16, 23, 25)>
- <21, (0, 7, 10)>
- <20, (2, 11, 6)>
- <4, (3, 11, 12)>
- <17, (15, 23, 28)>
- <26, (1, 3, 28)>
- <14, (26, 27, 28)>
- <29, (13, 24, 19)>
