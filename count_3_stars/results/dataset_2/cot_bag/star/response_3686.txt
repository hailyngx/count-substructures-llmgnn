Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 14) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 11) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (16, 13) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 17) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (18, 10) (9, 0) (9, 17) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 49 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 8, 10)>, <1, (0, 15, 16)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <3, (10, 17, 3)>, <4, (2, 5, 12)>, <5, (4, 7, 10)>, <7, (5, 9, 17)>, <10, (0, 3, 18)>, <12, (4, 6, 15)>, <13, (2, 14, 16)>, <14, (1, 2, 13)>, <15, (7, 12, 17)>, <17, (7, 9, 15)>
