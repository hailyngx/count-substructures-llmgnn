Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node for easier reference:
- Node 0: 7, 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7, 6, 9, 0, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8, 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 5, 6, 2
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 7, 1, 5, 2
- Node 7: 4, 0, 6, 9, 2, 1
- Node 8: 4, 1, 3, 2, 0
- Node 9: 7, 1, 0

Now, let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
<0, (7, 1, 9)>, <0, (7, 1, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>

Node 1: It also has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars. 
<1, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 9, 0)>

Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 6)>

Node 4: It has 5 neighbors, forming 5 3-stars.
<4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>

Node 6: It has 5 neighbors, forming 5 3-stars.
<6, (4, 7, 1)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>, <6, (7, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 2)>

Node 7: It has 6 neighbors, forming 6 3-stars.
<7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>, <7, (6, 1, 2)>, <7, (9, 1, 2)>

Node 8: It has 5 neighbors, forming 5 3-stars.
<8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>, <8, (2, 0, 4)>

Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, forming 3 3-stars.
<9, (7, 1, 0)>, <9, (7, 0, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 36 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [36].
