Node 5: 12, 26
Node 6: 17, 11, 25, 4, 16
Node 7: 24, 15
Node 8: 22, 15
Node 9: 10, 23
Node 10: 17, 9
Node 11: 28, 24, 6
Node 12: 27, 20, 5, 21
Node 13: 4, 29, 18

Node 16: 3, 18, 6, 22
Node 17: 1, 10, 6, 23
Node 18: 20, 13, 19, 16
Node 19: 20, 18, 29
Node 20: 0, 12, 18, 19, 23
Node 21: 12, 14, 28
Node 22: 3, 14, 8, 16
Node 23: 17, 20, 15, 9
Node 24: 11, 7
Node 25: 1, 6
Node 26: 5, 2, 29
Node 27: 12
Node 28: 21, 11, 2
Node 29: 13, 4, 26, 19

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 4, we have only one 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 29)>.
For Node 6, we have the following 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 25)>, <6, (4, 16, 22)>, <6, (11, 16, 6)>, and <6, (16, 17, 6)>.
For Node 12, we have the 3-star: <12, (5, 20, 21)>.
For Node 14, we have the 3-star: <14, (21, 22, 28)>.
For Node 16, we have the following 3-stars: <16, (3, 18, 22)> and <16, (4, 6, 22)>.
For Node 18, we have the 3-star: <18, (13, 16, 19)>.
For Node 20, we have the following 3-stars: <20, (0, 19, 23)>, <20, (12, 21, 28)>, and <20, (18, 19, 29)>.
For Node 22, we have the 3-star: <22, (8, 16, 18)>.
For Node 26, we have only one 3-star: <26, (2, 29, 4)>.
For Node 28, we have only one 3-star: <28, (2, 21, 11)>.
For Node 29, we have only one 3-star: <29, (13, 19, 26)>.

Counting up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of 16 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [16].
