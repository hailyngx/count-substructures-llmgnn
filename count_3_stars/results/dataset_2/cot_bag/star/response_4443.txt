Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 6) (19, 17) (26, 22) (26, 15) (26, 11) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (9, 21) (9, 24) (0, 21) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 28) (20, 7) (20, 29) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 2) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 15) (13, 17) (13, 27) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 16) (14, 4) (14, 24) (14, 25) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 26) (15, 28) (15, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (1, 25) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 18) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 2) (27, 24) (24, 9) (24, 14) (24, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
   - Node 23 has 6 neighbors
   - Node 17 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 16 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 22 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 26 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 29 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 12 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 21 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 14 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 27 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 24 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors

2. Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
   - Node 23: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
   - Total = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

Some of the unique 3-stars found are:
- <23, (8, 1, 16)>
- <7, (3, 20, 29)>
- <5, (12, 3, 4)>
- <17, (23, 19, 28)>
- <16, (23, 12, 2)>
- <27, (28, 13, 2)>
- <29, (7, 20, 16)>
- <12, (16, 2, 11)>
