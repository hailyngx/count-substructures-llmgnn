Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 11) (4, 18) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 20) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 24) (20, 6) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 29) (22, 1) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 12) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 11) (14, 29) (14, 27) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 16) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 12) (24, 20) (24, 23) (24, 2) (24, 17) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 27) (28, 19) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (12, 23) (12, 13) (12, 8) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 8) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 27) (17, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 21) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (27, 14) (27, 16) (27, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of [140] 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (11, 26, 10)>, <1, (8, 11, 22)>, <2, (11, 24, 29)>, <3, (20, 21, 25)>, <4, (6, 16, 18)>, <5, (6, 10, 15)>, <7, (8, 12, 23)>, <13, (7, 12, 26)>, <14, (19, 27, 29)>, <17, (16, 19, 27)>, <18, (4, 6, 16)>, <20, (3, 24, 25)>, <22, (1, 2, 29)>, <23, (12, 15, 24)>, <26, (10, 13, 26)>
