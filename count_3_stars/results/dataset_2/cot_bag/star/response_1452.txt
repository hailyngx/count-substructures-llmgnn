Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 8, 1, 3).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 1).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 3).
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (9, 7, 0, 1, 3, 2).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (4, 0, 8).
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 8).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 3, 1).
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 0, 8, 2).
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 8, 2).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 1, 3).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node contributes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10] = 58 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>,
<4, (7, 0, 8)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (1, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>,
<1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 0, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>,
<3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>
