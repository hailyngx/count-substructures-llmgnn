Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 1) (0, 19) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- 0: (19)
- 1: (16, 18, 12, 9)
- 2: (7, 14)
- 3: (11, 4, 8)
- 4: (11, 7, 9, 3)
- 5: (14, 19, 15)
- 6: (10, 12)
- 7: (4, 2)
- 8: (13, 19, 14, 17, 3)
- 9: (4, 1)
- 10: (11, 6, 19, 14)
- 11: (3, 10, 4, 16)
- 12: (6, 15, 1)
- 13: (8, 19, 18)
- 14: (8, 10, 2, 5)
- 15: (16, 5, 12)
- 16: (11, 1, 15)
- 17: (8)
- 18: (13, 1)
- 19: (8, 13, 10, 0, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars and list them:

- Node 1: [1]
  - <1, (16, 9, 12)>
- Node 3: [1]
  - <3, (11, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: [1]
  - <4, (11, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: [1]
  - <5, (14, 19, 15)>
- Node 8: [1]
  - <8, (13, 17, 14)>
- Node 10: [1]
  - <10, (11, 6, 14)>
- Node 11: [1]
  - <11, (3, 10, 4)>
- Node 12: [1]
  - <12, (6, 15, 1)>
- Node 13: [1]
  - <13, (8, 19, 18)>
- Node 14: [1]
  - <14, (8, 10, 5)>
- Node 15: [1]
  - <15, (16, 5, 12)>
- Node 16: [1]
  - <16, (1, 15, 11)>
- Node 19: [1]
  - <19, (8, 10, 5)>

Combine all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13].
