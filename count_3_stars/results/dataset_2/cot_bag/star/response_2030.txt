Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

For node 0: Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around it. Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

For node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors as well, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed around it.

For node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 4: Node 4 has 6 neighbors, thus \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 6: Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars are formed around it.

For node 8: Node 8 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 9: Node 9 has 5 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 72 \).

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 2>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, 
<3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 2>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, 
<6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 0, 2>, <8, 4, 1>, <8, 4, 0>, 
<8, 6, 0>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 3>, <9, 3, 8>, <9, 3, 7>.
