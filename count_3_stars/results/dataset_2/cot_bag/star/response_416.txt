Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 5) (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 19) (2, 29) (2, 6) (29, 7) (29, 2) (29, 9) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 5) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 5) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 0) (26, 17) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 19) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 13) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (15, 12) (15, 14) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 0) (13, 28) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 14) (23, 26) (23, 24) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 11) (0, 26) (0, 9) (0, 25) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 13) (24, 23) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 1) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 27) (5, 28) (16, 3) (16, 14) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 16) (8, 26) (8, 3) (8, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 1 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <1, (5, 9, 10)>

4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 4:
<4, (7, 22, 28)>, <4, (7, 19, 11)>, <4, (7, 22, 26)>, <4, (7, 24, 13)>

5:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 5:
<5, (1, 21, 27)>, <5, (1, 21, 28)>, <5, (1, 21, 27)>, <5, (1, 27, 28)>, <5, (21, 27, 28)>, <5, (21, 27, 28)>, <5, (21, 27, 12)>, <5, (21, 27, 23)>, <5, (27, 23, 26)>, <5, (21, 27, 23)>

7:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
There are 20 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 7:
<7, (4, 11, 19)>, <7, (4, 11, 24)>, <7, (4, 19, 24)>, <7, (4, 19, 22)>, <7, (4, 22, 28)>, <7, (4, 22, 26)>, <7, (11, 19, 24)>, <7, (11, 19, 24)>, <7, (11, 19, 3)>, <7, (11, 3, 19)>, <7, (11, 3, 13)>, <7, (11, 3, 8)>, <7, (24, 13, 23)>, <7, (19, 24, 23)>, <7, (24, 13, 23)>, <7, (24, 23, 29)>, <7, (24, 27, 13)>, <7, (24, 27, 23)>, <7, (27, 13, 24)>, <7, (27, 24, 23)>

12:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 12 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <12, (21, 27, 15)>

13:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 13:
<13, (3, 17, 28)>, <13, (3, 17, 24)>, <13, (17, 24, 26)>, <13, (24, 23, 27)>

14:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 14:
<14, (12, 15, 25)>, <14, (12, 15, 16)>, <14, (15, 25, 27)>, <14, (25, 27, 16)>

20:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 20 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <20, (21, 17, 6)>

21:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 21 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <21, (1, 20, 5)>

22:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 22 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <22, (4, 28, 26)>

24:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 24:
<24, (7, 13, 23)>, <24, (7, 13, 27)>, <24, (7, 23, 26)>, <24, (13, 23, 27)>

26:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
There are 20 possible 3-stars that can be formed with node 26:
<26, (22, 23, 28)>, <26, (22, 23, 27)>, <26, (22, 23, 24)>, <26, (22, 24, 8)>, <26, (22, 24, 0)>, <26, (22, 24, 13)>, <26, (22, 28, 5)>, <26, (22, 28, 27)>, <26, (23, 24, 13)>, <26, (24, 8, 17)>, <26, (24, 0, 25)>, <26, (24, 8, 18)>, <26, (24, 13, 23)>, <26, (24, 13, 27)>, <26, (24, 8, 18)>, <26, (0, 25, 14)>, <26, (0, 25, 14)>, <26, (0, 25, 27)>, <26, (0, 25, 14)>, <26, (13, 27, 24)>

27:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 27 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <27, (5, 12, 21)>

28:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 28 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <28, (22, 5, 26)>

29:
Only one 3-star can be formed with node 29 since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <29, (2, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 72
Therefore, the final answer is [72].
