Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 73 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [73].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 10, 14)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 10)>
<5, (1, 9, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 13)>
<8, (2, 6, 14)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 1)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<13, (7, 10, 3)>
<14, (8, 6, 1)>
