Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
The graph has the following structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) 
(9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) 
(1, 11) (1, 4) 
(3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
(8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) 
(13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) 
(0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) 
(7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) 
(2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) 
(12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) 
(11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) 
(14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) 
(6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 
(10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) 
(4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14)

Let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 13, 7, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 13, 12, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 11, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 0, 3, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 0, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 11, 6, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 10, 6, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 10, 7, and 0.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 12, and 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 10, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 4.

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 13, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 13, 12)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 11)>
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 14)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (5, 13, 10)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 14, 10)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (1, 7, 12)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (8, 2, 10)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (8, 2, 0)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (5, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 12, so the final answer is [12].
