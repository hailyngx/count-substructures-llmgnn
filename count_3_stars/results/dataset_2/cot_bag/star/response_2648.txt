Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 14) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 16) (18, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, and 5.

For node 1:
- It has 4 neighbors: nodes 16, 15, 7, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (16, 15, 7)>, <1, (16, 15, 5)>, <1, (16, 7, 5)>, <1, (15, 7, 5)>

For node 4:
- It has 5 neighbors: nodes 18, 14, 6, 19, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (18, 14, 6)>, <4, (18, 14, 19)>, <4, (18, 14, 5)>, <4, (18, 6, 19)>, <4, (18, 6, 5)>, <4, (18, 19, 5)>, <4, (14, 6, 19)>, <4, (14, 6, 5)>, <4, (14, 19, 5)>, <4, (6, 19, 5)>

For node 5:
- It has 5 neighbors: nodes 12, 0, 1, 19, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (12, 0, 1)>, <5, (12, 0, 19)>, <5, (12, 0, 8)>, <5, (12, 1, 19)>, <5, (12, 1, 8)>, <5, (12, 19, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 19)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 19, 8)>, <5, (1, 19, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24
Therefore, the final answer is [24].
