Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 16) (1, 21) (1, 2) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 20) (18, 22) (18, 11) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 11) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 20) (17, 10) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 0) (28, 9) (28, 11) (28, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 14) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (13, 0) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 16) (25, 24) (14, 11) (14, 3) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 23) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 19) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 13) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 29) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (26, 6, 28, 16)
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors (9, 13, 16)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (21, 2)
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors (1, 0, 22, 2)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 3, 20)
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors (22, 11)
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors (21, 18, 10)
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors (5, 29, 12)
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (22, 17, 12, 19, 20)
- Node 17 has 1 neighbor (10)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (15, 10, 24, 0)
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (9, 11, 2)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (8, 5)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 20, 3)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (18, 27, 28, 14)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (26, 16, 24, 7, 0)
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (6, 10, 8, 19)
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors (15, 7, 16)
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors (11, 3)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (13, 29, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (15, 4, 7, 23)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 14, 19)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 21, 28)
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors (12, 13, 25)
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (21, 12, 13)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (9, 26, 13, 29)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors (10, 20, 3)

Now, we need to count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 22: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 24: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing these up, we get: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<9, (26, 6, 16)>, <21, (1, 0, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 20)>, <10, (22, 12, 19)>, <12, (15, 24, 0)>, <13, (26, 24, 7)>, <20, (10, 8, 19)>, <5, (15, 4, 23)>, <3, (6, 8, 19)>, and <16, (9, 26, 29)>.
