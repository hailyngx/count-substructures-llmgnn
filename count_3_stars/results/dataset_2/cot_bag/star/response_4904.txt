Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 1) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 19) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (9, 3) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 17)>, <1, (0, 8, 15)>, <2, (6, 5, 0)>, <3, (10, 9, 12)>, <6, (2, 0, 18)>, <10, (3, 11, 17)>, <11, (10, 18, 19)>, <12, (3, 19, 4)>, <13, (18, 4, 1)>, <15, (0, 2, 1)>, <16, (7, 19, 5)>, <17, (10, 0, 2)>, <18, (13, 6, 19)>, <19, (11, 12, 16)>.
