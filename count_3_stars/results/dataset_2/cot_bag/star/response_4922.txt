Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1 neighbor  
Node 1: 5 neighbors  
Node 2: 4 neighbors  
Node 3: 4 neighbors  
Node 4: 4 neighbors  
Node 5: 5 neighbors  
Node 6: 4 neighbors  
Node 7: 4 neighbors  
Node 8: 5 neighbors  
Node 9: 3 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

There are no 3-stars for Node 0 and Node 9 since they have less than 3 neighbors.  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (2, 7, 8)>  
<1, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (3, 7, 8)>  
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 8, 6)>  
<5, (1, 4, 7)>  
<5, (1, 4, 8)>  
<5, (1, 7, 8)>  
<5, (2, 6, 8)>  
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
