Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 3. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 2), so the number of 3-stars formed by node 0 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 2 has 6 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 1), so the number of 3-stars formed by node 2 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 3 has 7 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 8), so the number of 3-stars formed by node 3 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

Since there is only one unique 3-star for each node with exactly 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars is the sum of the 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 2, and 3, which is 75 in total. Thus, the final answer is [75].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
