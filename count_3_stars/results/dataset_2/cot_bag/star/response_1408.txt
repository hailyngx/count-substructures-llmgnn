Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 13) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 3) (18, 27) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 15) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 15) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 12) (27, 13) (8, 23) (8, 25) (0, 29) (0, 13) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (29, 0) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 21) (2, 15) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 3) (13, 9) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (16, 24) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 19) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 11) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 28) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 28) (14, 26) (14, 5) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 15) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 28) (19, 16) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 28) (25, 10) (10, 14) (10, 25) (21, 22) (21, 5) (21, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
4. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
10. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
12. Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is represented as [42], and the unique 3-star configurations are: <9, (22, 27, 13)>, <12, (27, 4, 15)>, <13, (9, 27, 0)>, <16, (24, 28, 7)>, <17, (29, 11, 7)>, <21, (22, 5, 4)>, <22, (9, 23, 11)>, <23, (22, 8, 15)>, <25, (8, 13, 10)>, <26, (24, 14, 3)>, <27, (9, 18, 12)>, <28, (16, 3, 1)>, <29, (0, 17, 11)>.
