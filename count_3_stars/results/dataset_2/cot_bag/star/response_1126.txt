Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 3) (0, 19) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 15) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 15) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 18) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
We'll first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {19, 9}
- 1: {2, 19}
- 2: {1, 11, 9}
- 3: {13, 9, 10, 12}
- 4: {15}
- 5: {10, 7}
- 6: {17, 16, 7, 15}
- 7: {17, 5, 6, 18}
- 8: {14, 15, 12}
- 9: {0, 2, 3}
- 10: {14, 5, 3}
- 11: {14, 19, 2}
- 12: {14, 8, 3}
- 13: {3}
- 14: {17, 11, 8, 12, 10}
- 15: {6, 8, 4, 18}
- 16: {17, 6}
- 17: {14, 17, 16, 18, 7}
- 18: {17, 7, 15}
- 19: {0, 11, 1}

Now let's identify the nodes that are centers of 3-stars by checking the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {14, 17, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 19}

Now we'll find the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula  \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node and summing up:

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{10}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \)

Total number of 3-stars = 120 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1

Total number of 3-stars = 153

Therefore, there are 153 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found within the graph are: 

<14, (17, 11, 10)>, <17, (14, 6, 18)>, <6, (17, 16, 15)>, <7, (17, 5, 18)>, <8, (14, 15, 12)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <10, (14, 5, 3)>, <11, (14, 19, 2)>, <12, (14, 8, 3)>, <15, (6, 8, 18)>, <19, (11, 1, 0)>.

Putting the final count in brackets: [153]
