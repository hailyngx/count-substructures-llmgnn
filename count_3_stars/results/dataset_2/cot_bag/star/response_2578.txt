Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 11) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 8) (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 26) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 13) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 19) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 4) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 23) (4, 18) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (26, 0) (26, 23) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 10) (29, 5) (29, 15) (29, 20) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 26) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (17, 9) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 17) (25, 1) (24, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 3) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 25) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 1, node 4, node 5, and node 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    - <1, 9, 25>
    - <1, 4, 14>
    - <1, 4, 25>

For node 4:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    - <4, 1, 14>

For node 5:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star:
    - <5, 3, 19>

For node 8:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, 2, 4>
    - <8, 4, 27>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28 \). Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
