Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [6 \cdot 4 + 10] = [34] \)

Therefore, there are 34 unique 3-stars in the provided graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
