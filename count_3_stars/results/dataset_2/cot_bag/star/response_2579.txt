Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 14)>
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 11)>
<5, (6, 9, 12)>
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<7, (3, 0, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 11)>
<9, (5, 11, 12)>
<10, (0, 13, 14)>
<11, (9, 8, 4)>
<12, (5, 9, 1)>
<14, (10, 11, 7)>
