Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 7) (22, 13) (9, 26) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 21) (21, 7) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 24) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 2) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 14) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 6) (2, 26) (2, 25) (8, 19) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 24) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 5) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 29) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 26) (3, 18) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 29) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 10) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 28) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 28) (20, 14) (20, 8) (20, 4) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 4) (4, 20) (4, 28) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 29) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 13, 26, 14, 17, 7, 0, 25, 12, 27, 2, 19, 29, 5, 16, 6, 11, 18, 1, 23, 10, 24, 20, 28.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

- Node 13: C(4, 3) = 4
  <13, (22, 12, 29)>, <13, (22, 12, 7)>, <13, (22, 29, 7)>, <13, (12, 29, 7)>

- Node 26: C(4, 3) = 4
  <26, (9, 2, 3)>, <26, (9, 2, 0)>, <26, (9, 3, 0)>, <26, (2, 3, 0)>

- Node 14: C(3, 3) = 1
  <14, (17, 27, 20)>

- Node 17: C(3, 3) = 1
  <17, (14, 11, 7)>

- Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4
  <7, (13, 17, 21)>, <7, (13, 17, 21)>, <7, (17, 21, 11)>, <7, (13, 17, 21)>

- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
  <0, (26, 25, 24)>

- Node 25: C(4, 3) = 4
  <25, (0, 19, 2)>, <25, (0, 19, 6)>, <25, (0, 2, 6)>, <25, (19, 2, 6)>

- Node 12: C(4, 3) = 4
  <12, (13, 27, 15)>, <12, (13, 27, 1)>, <12, (13, 15, 1)>, <12, (27, 15, 1)>

- Node 27: C(4, 3) = 4
  <27, (14, 12, 1)>, <27, (14, 6, 1)>, <27, (12, 6, 1)>, <27, (14, 6, 1)>

- Node 2: C(2, 3) = 0

- Node 19: C(4, 3) = 4
  <19, (9, 25, 8)>, <19, (9, 8, 16)>, <19, (9, 8, 16)>, <19, (25, 8, 16)>

- Node 29: C(5, 3) = 10
  <29, (13, 18, 1)>, <29, (13, 18, 23)>, <29, (13, 18, 15)>, <29, (13, 1, 23)>, <29, (13, 1, 15)>, <29, (13, 23, 15)>, <29, (18, 1, 23)>, <29, (18, 1, 15)>, <29, (18, 23, 15)>, <29, (1, 23, 15)>

- Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
  <5, (23, 11, 24)>

- Node 16: C(3, 3) = 1
  <16, (19, 15, 6)>

- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
  <6, (25, 27, 16)>, <6, (25, 27, 10)>, <6, (25, 16, 10)>, <6, (27, 16, 10)>

- Node 11: C(2, 3) = 0

- Node 18: C(4, 3) = 4
  <18, (29, 10, 3)>, <18, (29, 10, 28)>, <18, (29, 3, 28)>, <18, (10, 3, 28)>

- Node 1: C(2, 3) = 0

- Node 23: C(3, 3) = 1
  <23, (9, 5, 29)>

- Node 10: C(2, 3) = 0

- Node 24: C(3, 3) = 1
  <24, (0, 5, 28)>

- Node 20: C(3, 3) = 1
  <20, (14, 8, 4)>

- Node 28: C(3, 3) = 1
  <28, (10, 24, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1]. Summing these up gives us 41. 

Therefore, the final answer is [41].
