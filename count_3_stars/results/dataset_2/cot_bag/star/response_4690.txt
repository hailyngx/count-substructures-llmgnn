Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (10, 17) (10, 18) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 19) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 15) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 1) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

Now we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 15, 16)>, <1, (4, 7, 11)>, <3, (4, 8, 19)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 13, 17)>, <8, (4, 9, 18)>, <9, (6, 8, 12)>, <11, (1, 15, 17)>, <13, (2, 5, 16)>, <15, (0, 11, 5)>, <16, (0, 13, 7)>, <17, (10, 3, 5)>, <18, (8, 10, 12)>, <19, (1, 3, 7)>
