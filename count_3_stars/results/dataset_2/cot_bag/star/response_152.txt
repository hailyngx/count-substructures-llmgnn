Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 9, 0
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8, 0, 7
