Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (9, 7, 8, 5, 0)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (7, 8, 2, 4)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (7, 4, 2, 5)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (6, 1, 3, 2, 5)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 7, 3, 4)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (9, 2, 4)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (9, 0, 7, 1, 8)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (6, 8, 0)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 4)>, <1, (8, 2, 4)>, <3, (7, 4, 5)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>.
