Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 19) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 16) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 18, 15, 7, 16, 19, 2, 0, 13, and 14. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (2, 4, 16)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 13, 15)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<15, (0, 2, 19)>
<16, (2, 5, 12)>
