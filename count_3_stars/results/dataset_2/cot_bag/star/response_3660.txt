Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 --- 11
   /         \
 10 --- 2 --- 6 --- 1 --- 8
  |     |     |     |     |
 16 --- 7 --- 3 --- 17    9
  |         |     |     |
  |         13 --- 5 --- 19
  |          \         /
  |           18 --- 14
  |                /
  12 --- 4 --- 14
   \         |     \
    15 --- 19      7
      \     |     /
       17 --- 3
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to see how many 3-stars we can form:

- Node 2 has neighbors 10, 13, and 6. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors 7, 11, and 17. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors 9, 7, and 12. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 5 has no neighbors with degree 3 or more.
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 14, and 16. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 9, and 19. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors 16, 8, and 4. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 10 has neighbors 11, 16, and 2. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 11 has neighbors 0, 3, and 10. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 12 has neighbors 4, 15, and 17. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 13 has no neighbors with degree 3 or more.
- Node 14 has neighbors 16, 7, and 4. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 15 has neighbors 19, 7, and 12. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 16 has neighbors 9, 7, and 10. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 17 has neighbors 12, 3, and 13. So it forms one 3-star.
- Node 18 has no neighbors with degree 3 or more.
- Node 19 has neighbors 5, 15, and 8. So it forms one 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, 11, 17>
<4, 7, 16>
<8, 1, 9>
<9, 4, 16>
<10, 2, 16>
<11, 0, 10>
<12, 4, 17>
<14, 4, 7>
<14, 7, 16>
<15, 7, 19>
<16, 9, 7>
<17, 3, 12>
<19, 5, 8>
