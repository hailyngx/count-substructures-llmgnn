Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 24) (2, 25) (29, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 6) (22, 4) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 13) (18, 2) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (21, 9) (21, 19) (28, 11) (28, 26) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (17, 23) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (26, 28) (26, 16) (10, 13) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 24) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 24) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 22) (3, 5) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 20) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 6) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 13) (19, 0) (19, 21) (19, 1) (19, 17) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-star structures:

- Node 2: <2, (18, 24, 25)>
- Node 0: <0, (27, 14, 19)>
- Node 27: <27, (0, 6, 25)>
- Node 22: <22, (4, 25, 3)>
- Node 23: <23, (8, 15, 17)>
- Node 8: <8, (23, 5, 12)>
- Node 14: <14, (0, 9, 24)>
- Node 11: <11, (28, 9, 7)>
- Node 17: <17, (23, 1, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (18, 26, 9)>
- Node 15: <15, (23, 12, 4)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 17, 25)>
- Node 9: <9, (14, 21, 11)>
- Node 13: <13, (23, 10, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (27, 25, 12)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [14].
