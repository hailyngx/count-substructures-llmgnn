Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 3, 15, 9, 10, 2, 0, 14, 5, 13, 19, 4, 12, 1, 7, 16, 8, and 17.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 9, 10)>, <3, (0, 9, 15)>, <3, (10, 9, 15)>, <3, (0, 10, 15)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <15, (2, 5, 16)>, <15, (2, 16, 5)>, <15, (5, 16, 19)>, <15, (2, 16, 6)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <9, (1, 11, 3)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <10, (4, 8, 3)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <2, (14, 17, 15)>

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <0, (14, 3, 8)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <5, (19, 15, 2)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (1, 4, 11)>, <13, (1, 4, 12)>, <13, (1, 11, 12)>, <13, (4, 11, 12)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <19, (1, 5, 7)>, <19, (1, 7, 17)>, <19, (5, 7, 17)>, <19, (1, 5, 17)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (10, 12, 13)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <12, (4, 13, 16)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (9, 13, 19)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (16, 18, 19)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <16, (6, 7, 15)>, <16, (6, 7, 12)>, <16, (7, 12, 15)>, <16, (6, 12, 15)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 10, 17)>, <8, (0, 17, 18)>, <8, (10, 17, 18)>, <8, (0, 10, 18)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <17, (2, 8, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of $4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33$ unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is $[33]$.
