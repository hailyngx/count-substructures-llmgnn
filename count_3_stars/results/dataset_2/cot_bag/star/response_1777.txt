Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 67 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 67 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
Putting this number inside brackets: [67]

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (3, 4, 10)>  
<1, (4, 10, 13)>  
<1, (4, 13, 0)>  
<1, (10, 13, 9)>  
<2, (8, 11, 12)>  
<2, (11, 12, 4)>  
<2, (11, 12, 2)>  
<2, (11, 12, 7)>  
<2, (12, 7, 5)>  
<3, (1, 10, 13)>  
<3, (1, 13, 0)>  
<3, (4, 10, 12)>  
<3, (4, 12, 7)>  
<4, (1, 10, 13)>  
<5, (3, 7, 14)>
