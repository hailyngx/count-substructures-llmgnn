Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 63.
The final result within brackets [] is 63.

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<1, 2, 14>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 10, 14>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 9, 13>, <3, 0, 12>, <4, 7, 13>, <5, 6, 13>, <7, 10, 13>, <8, 4, 12>, <8, 2, 12>, <10, 6, 13>, <11, 0, 6>, <11, 1, 6>
