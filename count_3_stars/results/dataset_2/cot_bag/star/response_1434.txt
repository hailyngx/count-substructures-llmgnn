Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 14) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 6, 8, 13, 5, 3, 11, 2, 12, 7, 14, 1, 10, and 4. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars from these nodes:

- Node 6:  <6, (5, 4, 3)> = 1 3-star
- Node 8:  <8, (6, 0, 7)>, <8, (13, 1, 11)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 13: <13, (8, 1, 11)>, <13, (10, 2, 1)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 5:  <5, (6, 0, 4)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 3:  <3, (6, 11, 7)>, <3, (2, 14, 7)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 11: <11, (8, 13, 3)>, <11, (12, 2, 10)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 2:  <2, (3, 12, 7)>, <2, (1, 14, 7)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)> = 3 3-stars
- Node 12: <12, (11, 10, 14)>, <12, (2, 10, 14)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 7:  <7, (8, 2, 1)>, <7, (3, 2, 10)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 14: <14, (9, 3, 12)>, <14, (3, 2, 12)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 1:  <1, (8, 13, 2)>, <1, (13, 2, 7)> = 2 3-stars
- Node 10: <10, (13, 2, 12)>, <10, (2, 12, 7)>, <10, (4, 12, 7)> = 3 3-stars
- Node 4:  <4, (6, 5, 10)> = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1] = [24].
