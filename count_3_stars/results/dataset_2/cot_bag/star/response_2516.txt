Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 40 edges in the graph, here is the calculation for the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
6. Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 (with 6 neighbors), there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 3 and 4 (with 5 neighbors), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Adding up these numbers gives: \( 4 * 20 + 2 * 10 = 100 \).

So, there are 100 3-stars in the graph. Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:

\[ \begin{align*} 
&<0, 1, 5> \\
&<0, 2, 4> \\
&<0, 2, 8> \\
&<0, 4, 8> \\
&<0, 5, 6> \\
&<0, 5, 7> \\
&<1, 2, 4> \\
&<1, 2, 8> \\
&<1, 4, 8> \\
&<1, 7, 5> \\
&<1, 3, 5> \\
&<2, 4, 8> \\
&<2, 6, 5> \\
&<2, 6, 3> \\
&<3, 5, 6> \\
&<3, 5, 1> \\
&<4, 7, 5> \\
&<4, 8, 2> \\
&<5, 6, 3> \\
&<5, 7, 1> \\
&<5, 9, 0> \\
&<6, 3, 2> \\
&<7, 5, 1> \\
&<8, 2, 4> \\
&<8, 4, 0> \\
&<9, 0, 5> \\
\end{align*} \]
