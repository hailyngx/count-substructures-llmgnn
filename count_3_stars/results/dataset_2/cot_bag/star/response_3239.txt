Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9, 10
- Node 1: 7, 10, 12
- Node 2: 0, 8, 10, 11
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8, 9, 11, 14
- Node 5: 8, 10, 11
- Node 6: 0, 8, 13
- Node 7: 1, 3, 11, 12, 14
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8, 13
- Node 10: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 11: 2, 4, 5, 7, 14
- Node 12: 1, 7, 13
- Node 13: 6, 9, 12, 14
- Node 14: 4, 7, 11, 13

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 58.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
