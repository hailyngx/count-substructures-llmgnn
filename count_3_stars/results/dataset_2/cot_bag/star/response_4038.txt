Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 25) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 0) (7, 22) (6, 28) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 29) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 23) (28, 4) (28, 6) (28, 25) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 5) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 23) (19, 8) (19, 2) (5, 17) (5, 2) (26, 6) (26, 2) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 26) (24, 3) (24, 10) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 20) (14, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 15) (23, 10) (21, 8) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 25) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) 

Response:
Looking at the provided edges, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (1,12), (1,15), (1,22), (2,5), (2,12), (2,19), (2,26), (3,14), (3,15), (3,23), (3,24), (3,29), (4,13), (4,28), (5,17), (6,26), (6,28), (7,22), (8,9), (8,11), (8,21), (8,18), (9,10), (9,17), (10,15), (10,23), (10,24), (11,17), (11,8), (12,16), (12,27), (13,14), (13,25), (14,20), (14,15), (15,29), (15,23), (16,25), (16,12), (17,5), (17,29), (17,9), (18,8), (19,2), (19,8), (20,21), (21,20), (22,1), (22,7), (22,29), (23,3), (23,10), (23,15), (23,27), (24,10), (24,3), (25,28), (25,16), (25,13), (26,6), (26,2), (27,12), (27,23), (28,25), (28,6), (28,4), (29,22), (29,3), (29,15), (29,17)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [61].
