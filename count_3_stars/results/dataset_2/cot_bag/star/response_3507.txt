Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (17, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (8, 7) (9, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 11, 16, 1, 3, 5, 10, 6, 19, 18, 14, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [74].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <11, (16, 5, 4)>
- <16, (11, 15, 1)>
- <1, (16, 5, 19)>
- <3, (0, 10, 6)>
- <5, (11, 16, 1)>
- <10, (16, 3, 13)>
- <6, (3, 5, 15)>
- <19, (1, 17, 18)>
- <18, (3, 19, 14)>
- <14, (18, 7, 2)>
- <0, (3, 18, 19)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <11, (16, 5, 4)>, <16, (11, 15, 1)>, <1, (16, 5, 19)>, <3, (0, 10, 6)>, <5, (11, 16, 1)>, <10, (16, 3, 13)>, <6, (3, 5, 15)>, <19, (1, 17, 18)>, <18, (3, 19, 14)>, and <14, (18, 7, 2)>.
