Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 8, 13, 10, 11, 7, 12, 5, 0, 2, 9, 4.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

1. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
8. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 93 \)

Therefore, we have a total of [93] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (5, 14, 3)>, <13, (5, 10, 1)>, <10, (11, 6, 7)>, <11, (9, 12, 4)>, <7, (12, 0, 9)>, <12, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 1)>, <0, (3, 9, 12)>, <2, (14, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 12, 0)>, <4, (10, 5, 1)>
