Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 9) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (18, 9) (18, 13) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (0, 11) (0, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we can first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 17, 2
- Node 6 has neighbors: 11, 9, 12, 19
- Node 7 has neighbors: 16, 13, 1, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 12
- Node 9 has neighbors: 16, 6, 18
- Node 12 has neighbors: 6, 8, 0
- Node 13 has neighbors: 16, 7, 18
- Node 14 has neighbors: 1, 10, 3, 19
- Node 15 has neighbors: 5, 1, 19
- Node 16 has neighbors: 7, 13, 9
- Node 17 has neighbors: 4, 5, 19
- Node 19 has neighbors: 6, 15, 14, 17

Now, we'll apply the formula for the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \sum_{{\text{{node with }} \geq 3 \text{{ neighbors}}}} \binom{{\text{{degree of the node}}}}{3} \]

Calculating for each node:

- Node 4 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has degree 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has degree 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has degree 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has degree 3, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has degree 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (8, 17, 2)>, <6, (11, 9, 12)>, <7, (16, 13, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <9, (16, 6, 18)>, <12, (6, 8, 0)>, <13, (16, 7, 18)>, <14, (1, 10, 3)>, <15, (5, 1, 19)>, <16, (7, 13, 9)>, <17, (4, 5, 19)>, <19, (6, 15, 14)>.
