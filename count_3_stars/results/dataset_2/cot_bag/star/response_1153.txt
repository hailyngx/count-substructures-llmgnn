Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can analyze which nodes have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 (each with 5 neighbors): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 3 (with 3 neighbors): only 1 3-star (it needs at least 2 more neighbors to form a 3-star).

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 \times 6 + 1 = 61 \)

So, the final count of total 3-stars is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
