Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 6, 2, 8, 0, 7, 9, 1, and 3.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and find the total:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<5, (6, 3, 1)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<5, (2, 6, 1)>
<5, (2, 3, 1)>
<5, (8, 6, 1)>
<5, (8, 3, 1)>
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<5, (2, 8, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (5, 8, 3)>

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (5, 3, 1)>
<2, (8, 6, 7)>

For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<8, (5, 6, 0)>

For nodes 0, 7, 9, 1, and 3: they all have exactly 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 21.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
