This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (12, 4) (12, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes. 

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 12, 5, 6, 11
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors: 4, 11, 10, 14, 9, 1, 7
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 7, 3, 2, 13, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 0, 13, 2, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 9, 13
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 7, 1, 6
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8, 5, 12
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, 5
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 7, 14
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 14, 5
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 7, 10, 2
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 4, 11, 13, 0, 2
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: 4, 13

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 10 unique 3-stars starting from node 4
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
    - 35 unique 3-stars starting from node 7
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 10 unique 3-stars starting from node 1
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 10 unique 3-stars starting from node 3
- Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed from node 6 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed from node 9 as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 10 unique 3-stars starting from node 11
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - 20 unique 3-stars starting from node 13
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed from node 0 as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed from node 10 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 4 unique 3-stars starting from node 2
- Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed from node 14 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 10 unique 3-stars starting from node 5
- Node 12: No 3-stars can be formed from node 12 as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 99 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [99].
