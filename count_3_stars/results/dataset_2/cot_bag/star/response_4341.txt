Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is constructed as follows:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 11, 13 <0, (4, 7, 10)>
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 13, 14 <No 3-star>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 13, 14 <7, (0, 1, 13)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 11 <8, (1, 3, 11)>
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 12, 13, 14 <10, (0, 1, 12)>
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 2, 10, 12, 14 <12, (2, 10, 14)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 10 <No 3-star>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 10, 12, 13 <14, (0, 2, 10)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
