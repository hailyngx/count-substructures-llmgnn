Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 3) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 74 \). Hence, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 14)>, <2, (0, 3, 14)>, <3, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (6, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 0, 13)>, <6, (4, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 13, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 0)>, <11, (1, 9, 12)>, <13, (5, 0, 9)>, <14, (2, 3, 12)>.
