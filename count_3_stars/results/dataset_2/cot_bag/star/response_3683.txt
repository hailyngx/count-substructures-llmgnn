Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 15) (21, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 18) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 24) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 19) (28, 12) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 15) (26, 5) (26, 12) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 25) (12, 28) (12, 26) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 10) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 27) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 24) (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 20) (13, 16) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (24, 18) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 27) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 23) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star can be formed.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 21, 20, 25>, <5, 26, 7, 23>, <6, 10, 17, 27>, <8, 14, 19, 22>, <10, 6, 8, 11>, <11, 14, 8, 27>, <15, 21, 19, 9>
