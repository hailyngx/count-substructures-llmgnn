Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 0)>.
