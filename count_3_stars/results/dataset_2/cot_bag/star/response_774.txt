Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 27) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 10) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (1, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (23, 14) (23, 8) (23, 9) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 16) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 26) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 27) (9, 23) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 19) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 2) (27, 17) (27, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 5) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 21) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 4) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 12) (10, 7) (10, 22) (10, 24) (12, 26) (12, 24) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 4) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 13) (24, 15) (24, 10) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 4) (4, 5) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 28) (19, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
(3, 15), (3, 11), (15, 24), (15, 21), (15, 16), (14, 17), (14, 23), (14, 2), (14, 25), (17, 27), (7, 21), (7, 6), (7, 10), (21, 20), (21, 5), (1, 8), (22, 2), (22, 10), (23, 8), (23, 9), (8, 16), (28, 29), (29, 6), (29, 26), (11, 0), (11, 27), (9, 19), (25, 18), (27, 11), (16, 6), (2, 9), (5, 26), (26, 12), (10, 24), (12, 24), (20, 4), (0, 13)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, thus it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 42. 

Therefore, the final answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<8, 16, 6>
<9, 2, 25>
<9, 2, 14>
<9, 29, 26>
<11, 0, 27>
