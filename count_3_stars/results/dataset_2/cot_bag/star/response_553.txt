Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be found as follows:

For node 0: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 1: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>

For node 3: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>

For node 4: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 5: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 6: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 8: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 2)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 9: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Adding up all the cases where 3-stars were formed, we get:
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

So, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [62].
