Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
We can start by identifying nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

When the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes is summed up, we get 40 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
