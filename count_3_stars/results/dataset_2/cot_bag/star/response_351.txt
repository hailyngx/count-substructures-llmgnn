Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's analyze each of these to determine the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 2: It has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 9, 26, and 6).
   - Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)    
   - <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 26)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 9, 26)>, <2, (1, 9, 6)>, <2, (1, 26, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 26)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 26, 6)>, <2, (9, 26, 6)>.

2. Node 3: It has 5 neighbors (1, 12, 13, 24, and 28).
   - Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <3, (1, 12, 13)>, <3, (1, 12, 24)>, <3, (1, 12, 28)>, <3, (1, 13, 24)>, <3, (1, 13, 28)>, <3, (1, 24, 28)>, <3, (12, 13, 24)>, <3, (12, 13, 28)>, <3, (12, 24, 28)>, <3, (13, 24, 28)>.

3. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (8, 16, 22, and 29).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
   - <4, (8, 16, 22)>.

4. Node 11: It has 4 neighbors (0, 12, 27, and 28).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
   - <11, (0, 12, 27)>.

5. Node 17: It has 4 neighbors (0, 13, 21, and 22).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
   - <17, (0, 13, 21)>.

6. Node 20: It has 3 neighbors (0, 10, and 14).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 0
   
7. Node 21: It has 4 neighbors (7, 17, 27, and 17).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
   - <21, (7, 27, 17)>.

8. Node 22: It has 4 neighbors (4, 10, 17, and 27).
   - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
   - <22, (4, 10, 27)>.

9. Node 26: It has 5 neighbors (2, 6, 10, 23, and 28).
   - Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <26, (2, 10, 23)>, <26, (2, 10, 28)>, <26, (2, 10, 6)>, <26, (2, 23, 28)>, <26, (2, 23, 6)>, <26, (2, 28, 6)>, <26, (10, 23, 28)>, <26, (10, 23, 6)>, <26, (10, 28, 6)>, <26, (23, 28, 6)>.

10. Node 27: It has 4 neighbors (21, 11, 25, and 22).
    - Total number of 3-stars = 1 
    - <27, (21, 11, 25)>.

Therefore, [10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 36 3-stars are formed in the given graph.
