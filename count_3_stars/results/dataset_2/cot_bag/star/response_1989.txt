Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 22) (17, 4) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 16) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 10) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (6, 17) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 6) (21, 8) (21, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 8) (16, 23) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 14) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 12) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 0) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 13) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 9) (3, 26) (3, 12) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 1) (10, 25) (26, 6) (26, 3) (26, 2) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 26) (2, 4) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 12) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 16) (4, 17) (4, 24) (4, 2) (12, 19) (12, 28) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the listed nodes:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 259 \]

So, there are a total of 259 3-stars in this graph.
\[ [259] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (14, 19, 28)>
<2, (15, 21, 4)>
<4, (17, 22, 24)>
<8, (8, 21, 0)>
<9, (9, 12, 25)>
<11, (11, 20, 24)>
<12, (12, 19, 28)>
<13, (13, 20, 28)>
<14, (1, 15, 29)>
<15, (2, 15, 27)>
<16, (0, 18, 23)>
