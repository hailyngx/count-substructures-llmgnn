Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) >> Total: 4
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) >> Total: 4
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) >> Total: 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) >> Total: 1
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) >> Total: 10
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) >> Total: 1

Summing up the totals for each node, we get: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 84

Therefore, there are 84 total 3-stars in this graph.
