Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors. Calculating for each:

Node 0: 3 neighbors.
Node 2: 4 neighbors.
Node 4: 5 neighbors.
Node 5: 4 neighbors.
Node 6: 4 neighbors.
Node 8: 6 neighbors.
Node 9: 3 neighbors.

Adding all nodes that can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
