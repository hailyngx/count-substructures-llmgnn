Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
There are three nodes with exactly three neighbors: node 1, node 4, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

For node 1:
The three neighbors are: 3, 13, 4
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<1, (3, 13, 4)>

For node 4:
The three neighbors are: 15, 1, 12
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<4, (15, 1, 12)>

For node 9:
The three neighbors are: 6, 2, 11
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
<9, (6, 2, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.
