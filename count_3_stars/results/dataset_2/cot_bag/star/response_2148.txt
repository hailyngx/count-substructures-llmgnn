Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (9, 4, 3)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 3, 2)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 1, 3)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (6, 1, 0, 2)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (5, 0, 1, 7)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (2, 8, 4, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (7, 3, 2, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 1, 8)
- Node 8: 6 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 3)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (8, 0)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 contributes $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 1 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 2 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes $\binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars.

Summing up, there are $1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 45$ 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (9, 4, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 1, 2)>, 
<1, (7, 8, 5)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, 
<2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>,
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 0, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 2)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (8, 9, 6)>, <6, (7, 1, 8)>, 
<6, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 1)>, 
<8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (7, 6, 3)>
