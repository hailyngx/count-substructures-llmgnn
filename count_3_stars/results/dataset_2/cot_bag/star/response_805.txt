Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (1, 23) (21, 0) (21, 12) (6, 5) (6, 26) (6, 27) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 21) (0, 26) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 27) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (17, 4) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (29, 18) (29, 17) (29, 19) (24, 27) (24, 26) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 25) (19, 29) (19, 15) (14, 22) (14, 12) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 28) (23, 16) (23, 1) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 25) (13, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 28) (28, 4) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with multiple neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 3 + 4 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 72 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [72].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 8, 28)>, <4, (3, 17, 29)>, <5, (15, 20, 25)>, <6, (1, 16, 23)>, <8, (2, 10, 28)>, <9, (2, 18, 10)>, <10, (8, 9, 28)>, <12, (14, 17, 25)>, <15, (5, 19, 25)>, <16, (1, 11, 23)>, <17, (4, 12, 22)>, <18, (9, 20, 29)>, <20, (13, 18, 28)>, <22, (14, 17, 22)>, <24, (26, 27, 24)>, <25, (12, 15, 26)>, <26, (6, 24, 27)>, <27, (4, 6, 7)>, <28, (2, 10, 20)>, <29, (17, 18, 19)>.
