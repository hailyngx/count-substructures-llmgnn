This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 21) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) (23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 19) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (29, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) (14, 24) (14, 12) (22, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 28.
Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 26, 7, 28, 6
Node 0 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 9, 16, 23, 25, 26
Node 2 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 11, 24, 28
Node 3 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 15
Node 4 contributes 1 3-star

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 15, 16, 24
Node 6 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 16, 17, 21, 28, 8
Node 8 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 10 contributes 1 3-star

Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 21, 22
Node 11 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 21, 26, 27
Node 13 contributes 1 3-star

Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 4, 20, 6
Node 15 contributes 1 3-star

Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 28
Node 16 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 1, 20, 23
Node 19 contributes 1 3-star

Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 13, 17, 29
Node 21 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 2, 19, 9
Node 23 contributes 1 3-star

Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 14, 27
Node 24 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 12, 13, 27
Node 26 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 16
Node 28 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding up the contributions from each node, we get a total of 69 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
