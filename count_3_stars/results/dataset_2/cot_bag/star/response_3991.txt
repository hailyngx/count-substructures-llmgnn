Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 10, 13, and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 2, 3, 10, and 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 10, and 1
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 3, and 13
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 2, 11, and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 2, 1, and 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 13
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 4, 5, 14, and 8
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 3, 11, and 9
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 9, 4, and 13

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 4 and Node 12 have exactly three neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, and Node 14 have more than three neighbors, so we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of them:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

\[ = 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 \]

\[ = 115 \]

Total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 12) + 115 = 117.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [117].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (12, 5, 14)>
<12, (4, 5, 14)>
<0, (8, 9, 14)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 4)>
<3, (7, 10, 13)>
<4, (10, 3, 1)>
<5, (10, 1, 12)>
<7, (3, 13, 14)>
<8, (11, 3, 1)>
<9, (1, 13, 14)>
<10, (3, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 13, 8)>
<12, (5, 4, 8)>
<13, (7, 11, 9)>
<14, (9, 13, 0)>
