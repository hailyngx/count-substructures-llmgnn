Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 2 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all these up: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 84\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 14, 2)>
- <2, (0, 14, 13)>
- <3, (6, 12, 13)>
- <4, (5, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 9, 14)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 14)>
- <11, (1, 7, 8)>
- <12, (6, 9, 14)>
- <13, (0, 2, 6)>
- <14, (0, 5, 9)>
