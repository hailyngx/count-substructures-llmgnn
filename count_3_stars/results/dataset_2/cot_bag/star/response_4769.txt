Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 27) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 28) (4, 5) (4, 8) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 24) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 27) (1, 8) (1, 18) (24, 28) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 14) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 12) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 23) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-stars formed with node 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors).
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 5).
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 6).
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars are formed with node 8).
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars are formed with node 11).
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 12).
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 13).
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 14).
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 15).
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 18).
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 21).
- For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 22).
- For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 24).
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 25).
- For node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-stars formed with node 26 as it has less than 3 neighbors).
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 27).
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star is formed with node 28).
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars are formed with node 29).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 44 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
