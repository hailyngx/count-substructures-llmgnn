Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 0, and 12. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.

For node 3, there are 4 neighbors: 13, 11, 10, and 12. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 5, and 1. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.

For node 5, there are 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, and 12. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 4, and 8. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors: 4, 2, 13, 5, and 1. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.

For node 8, there are 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 11, 12, and 1. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8.

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 14, and 10. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

For node 10, there are 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 0, and 5. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10.

For node 12, there are 5 neighbors: 8, 3, 5, 14, and 1. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12.

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 2, and 3. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 10+4+4+4+4+10+10+4+10+10+4 = 70 \).

So, there are a total of 70 3-stars in this graph.   
Therefore, the final answer is [70].
