Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 2) (18, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 3, 15, 1, 14, 7, 8, 16, 12, 11, 10, 13, 17, and 0. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 22.

Thus, the answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (5, 16, 13)>, 
<15, (8, 14, 11)>, 
<1, (11, 16, 7)>, 
<14, (15, 0, 12)>, 
<7, (5, 1, 11)>, 
<8, (15, 19, 10)>, 
<16, (9, 1, 0)>, 
<12, (14, 6, 11)>, 
<11, (15, 1, 7)>, 
<10, (8, 2, 4)>, 
<13, (9, 2, 18)>, 
<17, (8, 19, 2)>.
