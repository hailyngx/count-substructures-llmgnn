Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, and 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding them up: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 46 \)

So, there are 46 total 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (8, 11, 14)>, <9, (10, 12, 5)>, <6, (0, 12, 13)>, <1, (3, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 11, 4)>, <4, (0, 10, 8)>.
Inside brackets []: [46].
