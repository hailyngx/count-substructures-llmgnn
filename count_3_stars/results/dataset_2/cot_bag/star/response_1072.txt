Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (1 unique 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 3)>)

Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (1 unique 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 7)>)

Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 (10 unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>)

Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (1 unique 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 8)>)

Node 4: \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35 (35 unique 3-stars, too many to list)

Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (1 unique 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 4)>)

Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 (1 unique 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>)

Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 (10 unique 3-stars, too many to list)

Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 (4 unique 3-stars, too many to list)

Adding these up, we get a total of [63] 3-stars in the graph.
