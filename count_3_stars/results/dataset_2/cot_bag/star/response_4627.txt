Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 25) (21, 9) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 17) (1, 15) (1, 25) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 10) (22, 2) (24, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 20) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 29) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 11) (13, 20) (13, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 5) (27, 10) (27, 19) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 10) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 27) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 12, 14)>
<2, (10, 19, 22)>
<4, (0, 12, 25)>
<9, (6, 21, 23)>
<11, (6, 13, 28)>
<14, (0, 25, 29)>
<15, (1, 16, 24)>
<17, (12, 25, 26)>
<18, (8, 12, 26)>
<26, (17, 23, 29)>
