Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 46
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
