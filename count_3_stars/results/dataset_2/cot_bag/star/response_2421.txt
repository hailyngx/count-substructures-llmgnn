Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<1, (5, 3, 4)>

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (5, 1, 4)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (1, 0, 7)>

Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<7, (9, 8, 6)>

Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (3, 2, 4)>, <6, (8, 7, 4)>

Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 6)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20] = [69] \]

Therefore, there are 69 unique 3-stars in this graph.
