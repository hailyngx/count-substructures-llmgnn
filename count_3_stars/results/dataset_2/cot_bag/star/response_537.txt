Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 3, 8, 12, 0, 10, 11, 14, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 11, 4, and 14, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 0, and 4, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 12, 13, and 3, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 12, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 8, and 0, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 13, 8, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 6, 3, 2, 14, 10, 11, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 2, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 13, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 13, 14, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 5, 1, 2, 8, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 10, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 0, 10, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 85.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].
