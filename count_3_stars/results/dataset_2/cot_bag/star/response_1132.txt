Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) 

Response:
First, let's organize the information provided in the form of a list of nodes and their neighbors:

1: (10, 8, 0, 12, 7)
2: (11, 12, 7, 4)
3: (14, 4, 13)
4: (6, 2, 3, 12)
5: (6, 10, 0, 14)
6: (5, 14, 4, 0)
7: (10, 2, 1, 13)
8: (10, 0, 12, 1)
9: (12)
10: (11, 8, 7, 1, 13, 5)
11: (10, 14, 2)
12: (9, 2, 8, 4, 13, 1)
13: (10, 3, 12, 7)
14: (6, 11, 5, 3)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1, 10, and 13 have more than 3 neighbors, so they will form some 3-stars.
- Node 4 is the only node with exactly 3 neighbors, so it forms only one 3-star.
- Sum up the 3-stars formed by nodes 1, 10, and 13: 
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Total 3-stars: 10 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 10) + 4 (from node 13) + 1 (from node 4) = 35

So, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (10, 8, 12)> <1, (10, 8, 7)> <1, (10, 12, 7)> <1, (8, 12, 7)> <1, (10, 8, 0)> <1, (10, 12, 0)>
<1, (10, 7, 0)> <1, (8, 12, 0)> <1, (8, 7, 0)> <1, (12, 7, 0)> <10, (8, 12, 7)> <10, (10, 8, 12)>
<10, (10, 12, 7)> <10, (10, 8, 7)> <10, (8, 12, 7)> <13, (10, 12, 7)> <13, (10, 8, 12)> <13, (10, 8, 7)>
<13, (8, 12, 7)> <4, (6, 2, 12)>
