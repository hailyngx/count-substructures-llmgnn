Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are given by: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (9, 4, 2)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (6, 9, 3, 2, 4)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (9, 1, 8, 7, 0)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (6, 1, 5, 4)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (9, 1, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (6, 3, 1)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (5, 1, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (8, 2, 0)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (6, 4, 2, 7)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (4, 2, 1, 0)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 3 * 1 = 3 3-stars 
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \) 3-stars 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3 + 40 = 43, which can be written as [43].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (6, 3, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 0)>, <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 5)>, <3, (6, 4, 0)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <4, (9, 1, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 3, 1)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (8, 2, 0)>
