Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 5) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 11) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (14, 15) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 1) (13, 18) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 17, 10, 18, 7, 12, 8, 1, 15, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 10: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
For node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding them up: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<6, 9, 17>
<17, 5, 11>
<7, 12, 4>
<7, 8, 19>
<8, 19, 1>
<8, 15, 19>
<1, 19, 15>
