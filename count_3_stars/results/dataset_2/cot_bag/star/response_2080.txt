Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are a few nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

Node 1:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 2:  \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 3:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 4:  \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 5:  \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 7:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 9:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 10:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 11:  \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
Node 12:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 13:  \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 14:  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \(4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 85\)

Therefore, there are a total of 85 3-stars in this graph. Listing them all would be quite lengthy, so let's represent each unique 3-star just once:

[85]

<1, (4, 9, 13)>, <2, (0, 3, 14)>, <4, (1, 5, 10)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <11, (6, 10, 13)>
