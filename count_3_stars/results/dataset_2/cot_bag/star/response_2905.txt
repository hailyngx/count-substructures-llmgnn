Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([1 + 20 + 10]\). 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 8, 6)>
- <9, (4, 8, 7)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (4, 9, 6)>
- <9, (4, 9, 7)>
- <9, (4, 9, 8)>
- <9, (5, 8, 9)>
