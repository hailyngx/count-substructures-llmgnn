Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 18) (10, 14) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 1) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 30 \)

So, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 2, 12)>
<1, (14, 18, 9)>
<2, (16, 7, 0)>
<3, (7, 9, 16)>
<4, (11, 5, 19)>
<5, (9, 0, 19)>
<6, (9, 14, 18)>
<7, (13, 12, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 18)>
<11, (16, 13, 4)>
<13, (11, 7, 12)>
<14, (10, 1, 6)>
<16, (2, 11, 3)>
<17, (15, 18, 8)>
<18, (17, 15, 1)>
