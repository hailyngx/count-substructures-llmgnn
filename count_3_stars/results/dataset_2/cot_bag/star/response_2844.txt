Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 19) (15, 2) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 16) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:  
- Node 0 has neighbors {5, 10, 14, 19}  
- Node 1 has neighbors {4, 9, 12, 13, 17}  
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 6, 9}  
- Node 6 has neighbors {3, 4, 5, 11, 14}  
- Node 8 has neighbors {11, 12, 17}  
- Node 9 has neighbors {1, 4, 5}  
- Node 11 has neighbors {6, 8, 10, 12}  
- Node 12 has neighbors {1, 8, 11}  
- Node 14 has neighbors {0, 2, 6, 16}  
- Node 15 has neighbors {2, 16, 19}  
- Node 16 has neighbors {14, 15, 19}  
- Node 19 has neighbors {0, 7, 15, 16}  

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 12 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 15 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 16 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 19 forms 1 3-star.  

Adding them up:  
1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32  
\[ [32] \]  

The unique 3-stars are:   
<0, (5, 10, 19)>  
<1, (4, 9, 13)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<6, (5, 11, 14)>  
<8, (11, 12, 17)>  
<9, (1, 4, 5)>  
<11, (6, 8, 10)>  
<12, (1, 8, 11)>  
<14, (0, 6, 16)>  
<15, (2, 16, 19)>  
<16, (14, 15, 19)>  
<19, (0, 15, 16)>
