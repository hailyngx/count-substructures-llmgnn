Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 1) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 14) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 7) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 0) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 14) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 12, 16, 3, and 15. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- <0, (12, 16, 3)>
- <0, (12, 16, 15)>
- <0, (12, 3, 15)>
- <0, (16, 3, 15)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 15, and 18. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- <2, (8, 12, 15)>
- <2, (8, 12, 18)>
- <2, (8, 15, 18)>
- <2, (12, 15, 18)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 9, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 17)>
- <3, (0, 9, 17)>
- <3, (7, 9, 17)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 11, 12, and 1. So, there is 1 3-star with node 4.
- <4, (11, 12, 1)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 13, 14, and 17. So, there is 1 3-star with node 5.
- <5, (13, 14, 17)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 13, 7, and 17. So, there is 1 3-star with node 6.
- <6, (13, 7, 17)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 15, 18, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- <8, (2, 15, 18)>
- <8, (2, 15, 8)>
- <8, (2, 18, 8)>
- <8, (15, 18, 8)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 18, 3, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 9.
- <9, (18, 3, 7)>

Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, and 19. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 12.
- <12, (0, 2, 4)>
- <12, (0, 2, 19)>
- <12, (0, 4, 19)>
- <12, (2, 4, 19)>

Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 16, and 17. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13.
- <13, (5, 6, 16)>
- <13, (5, 6, 17)>
- <13, (5, 16, 17)>
- <13, (6, 16, 17)>

Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 15.
- <15, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 13, 14, and 0. So, there is 1 3-star with node 16.
- <16, (13, 14, 0)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 19, and 11. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 18.
- <18, (8, 9, 19)>
- <18, (8, 9, 11)>
- <18, (8, 19, 11)>
- <18, (9, 19, 11)>

Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 1, 12, and 18. So, there is 1 3-star with node 19.
- <19, (1, 12, 18)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
