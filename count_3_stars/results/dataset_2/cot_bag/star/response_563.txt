Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (7, 11, 14)>
<1, (6, 8, 13)> 
<5, (7, 10, 14)>
