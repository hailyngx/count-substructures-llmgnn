Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 4, 8, 5, 13, 0, 7, 11, 12, 10, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 75

So, the final answer is [75]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
- <6, (9, 7, 12)>
- <9, (6, 1, 8)>
- <1, (9, 4, 5)>
- <4, (6, 1, 8)>
- <8, (9, 4, 14)>
- <5, (1, 13, 11)>
- <13, (6, 5, 14)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (9, 13, 0)>
- <11, (3, 5, 4)>
- <12, (6, 9, 1)>
- <14, (8, 13, 7)>
