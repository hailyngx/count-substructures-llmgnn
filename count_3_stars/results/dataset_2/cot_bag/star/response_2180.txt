Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 2) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 25) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 5) (20, 16) (29, 0) (29, 5) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 5) (14, 1) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 11) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 22) (16, 20) (16, 7) (16, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 24) (11, 26) (11, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 5) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 24) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 21) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 18) (21, 8) (21, 0) (27, 18) (27, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 22) (22, 7) (22, 12) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes.

Starting with node 0:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Moving on to node 2:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 3:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 4:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 5:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 6:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 8:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 10:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 12:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 13:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 15:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 16:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 19:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 20:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 23:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 25:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 26:
\( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 28:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 29:
\( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node gives us a total of 41 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
