Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 28) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 11) (17, 7) (15, 5) (15, 20) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 23) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 23) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 27) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 1) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 2) (27, 28) (27, 4) (7, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (19, 29) (22, 20) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 13) (18, 6) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 20) (23, 14) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 22) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes have the potential to form 3-stars. From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 2, 29, 3, 25, 17, 15, 20, 14, 13, 26, 16, 28, 8, 27, 4, 11, 18, 23, and 24.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions from the nodes listed above gives a total of 82 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].
