Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 10, 11, 8, 13, 4, 7, 12, 5, 0, 1, 6, 3, 14, 2, and 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing these up: 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 100.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [100], and the unique 3-stars are:
