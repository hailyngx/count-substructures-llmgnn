The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are (0, 1, 12), (0, 5, 26), (0, 18, 19) <0, (1, 12, 19), (1, 12, 29), (1, 29, 10), (1, 29, 9), (1, 29, 2), (1, 29, 4)>
- For node 6, there are (6, 9, 29), (6, 9, 22) <6, (9, 22, 17), (9, 22, 2)>
- For node 9, there are (9, 22, 17), (9, 22, 2) <9, (22, 2, 10)>
- For node 12, there are (12, 29, 1) <12, (29, 1, 10)>
- For node 15, there are (15, 20, 16) <15, (20, 16, 14)>
- For node 16, there are (16, 20, 15) <16, (20, 15, 18)>
- For node 18, there are (18, 15, 20), (18, 15, 28) <18, (15, 28, 25)>
- For node 19, there are (19, 18, 15) <19, (18, 15, 28)>
- For node 20, there are (20, 16, 15) <20, (16, 15, 18)>
- For node 21, there are (21, 7, 25) <21, (7, 25, 28)>
- For node 22, there are (22, 9, 14) (22, 9, 6) <22, (9, 6, 29)>
- For node 25, there are (25, 21, 7) <25, (21, 7, 23), (21, 7, 25)>

Counting up these combinations, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph.
