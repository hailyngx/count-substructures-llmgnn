Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 10) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node gives:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 1 = 31 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [31].
