Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 70 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70], and they are: 

<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 10>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 5, 11>, <0, 5, 14>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 14>, <0, 10, 1>, <0, 10, 5>, <0, 10, 13>, <0, 13, 8>, <0, 13, 10>, <0, 13, 14>, <0, 14, 2>, <0, 14, 4>, <0, 14, 9>, <0, 14, 13>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 0, 10>, <1, 0, 13>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 11>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 10, 0>, <1, 10, 5>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 11, 6>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 13, 8>, <1, 13, 10>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 11>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 11>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 11, 6>, <2, 11, 9>, <2, 11, 5>, <2, 11, 14>, <2, 14, 6>, <2, 14, 9>, <2, 14, 0>, <2, 14, 4>, <2, 14, 5>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 13>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 1, 11>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 11>, <3, 13, 0>, <3, 13, 10>, <3, 13, 14>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 14>, <4, 1...
