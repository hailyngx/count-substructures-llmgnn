Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 2) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 13) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 9, 6, 14, 17, 1, 8, 7, 0, 12, 15, and 3.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:  
\(1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:

- <11, 16, 7, 19>
- <11, 16, 7, 8>
- <11, 16, 3, 14>
- <16, 7, 1, 17>
- <16, 7, 1, 4>
- <16, 7, 1, 12>
- <16, 7, 19, 12>
- <9, 5, 15, 6>
- <9, 6, 15, 14>
- <6, 9, 14, 3>
- <14, 9, 6, 15>
- <17, 11, 8, 19>
- <17, 11, 8, 7>

- <0, 3, 14, 15>
- <15, 5, 9, 14>
- <5, 9, 14, 15>
