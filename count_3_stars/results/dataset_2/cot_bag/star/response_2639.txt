Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 11) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 12
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 10, 11
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 10, 11
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 11, 12
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 10, 14
- Node 8: 4, 5, 10, 14
- Node 9: 4, 10, 12, 14
- Node 10: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 11: 2, 3, 5, 13
- Node 12: 1, 5, 9, 11
- Node 13: 11, 14
- Node 14: 7, 8, 9, 13

We see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14.  
For each of these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 10 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 45 3-stars in the graph: [45].
The unique 3-stars are:
