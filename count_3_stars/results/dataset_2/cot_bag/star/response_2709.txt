Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars with this node as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). The unique 3-stars involving node 5 are:
   - <5, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (3, 4, 6)>

2. Node 9 also has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 5. We calculate the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). The unique 3-stars involving node 9 are:
   - <9, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Since nodes 5 and 9 each have 20 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].
