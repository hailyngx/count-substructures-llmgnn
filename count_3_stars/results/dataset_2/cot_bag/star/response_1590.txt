Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 16) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30.

So, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 18)>
<0, (7, 14, 18)>
<0, (8, 16, 18)>
<0, (8, 16, 5)>
<5, (12, 9, 5)>
<5, (12, 9, 18)>
<5, (13, 19, 5)>
<5, (13, 19, 11)>
<5, (13, 19, 15)>
<5, (13, 19, 9)>
<7, (14, 15, 7)>
<7, (14, 15, 18)>
<11, (17, 19, 11)>
<11, (17, 19, 13)>
<13, (17, 19, 13)>
<15, (12, 4, 15)>
