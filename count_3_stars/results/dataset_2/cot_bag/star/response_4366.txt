Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 4 neighbors each: 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 1.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
