Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 19) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 18) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<14, (1, 15, 17)>, 
<17, (8, 14, 19)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 15)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 15)>, 
<7, (8, 12, 16)>, 
<12, (8, 11, 7)>, 
<3, (11, 13, 16)>, 
<11, (12, 19, 3)>, 
<8, (7, 12, 19)>, 
<19, (8, 11, 18)>, 
<18, (0, 8, 19)>, 
<1, (10, 14, 15)>, 
<16, (7, 13, 3)>, 
<9, (2, 10, 9)>, 
<0, (18, 8, 19)>, 
<2, (3, 9, 15)>, 
<10, (1, 12, 4)>, 
<13, (3, 15, 16)>.
