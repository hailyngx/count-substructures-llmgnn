Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 1) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 19) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (5, 16) (5, 17) (5, 1) 

Response:
Within the given graph, nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 8, 18, 19, 10, 14, 1, and 5.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the 3-stars formed by each node: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 42.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
