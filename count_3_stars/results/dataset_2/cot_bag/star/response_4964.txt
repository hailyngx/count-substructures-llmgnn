Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 3) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 27) (11, 4) (2, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 28) (4, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 25) (26, 13) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 24) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 9) (28, 4) (28, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 29) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 27) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 27) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 20) (15, 18) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 20) (20, 8) (20, 9) (20, 3) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 21) (24, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 3 has 4 neighbors, node 4 has 5 neighbors, node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 8 has 4 neighbors, node 9 has 4 neighbors, node 12 has 3 neighbors, node 13 has 3 neighbors, node 14 has 4 neighbors, node 16 has 3 neighbors, node 17 has 3 neighbors, node 18 has 4 neighbors, node 19 has 5 neighbors, node 20 has 3 neighbors, node 21 has 3 neighbors, node 22 has 3 neighbors, node 24 has 4 neighbors, node 25 has 3 neighbors, node 26 has 3 neighbors, node 27 has 4 neighbors, and node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Summing up the nodes with 3 or more neighbors gives a total of 22 nodes. Calculating \( \binom{3}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives us \( 1+1+4+10+10+4+4+1+1+4+1+1+4+10+1+1+1+4+1+4+1+1 = 61 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [61].
