Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 40 edges, each node must have a degree sum of \( \frac{2 \times 40}{10} = 8 \) since each edge contributes to the degrees of 2 nodes.   
Let's organize the nodes based on their connections:  

- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections

Now, we'll find the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (9, 6, 4)>
  - <5, (9, 8, 4)>
  - <5, (9, 6, 3)>
  - <5, (9, 8, 1)>
  - <5, (6, 4, 3)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (5, 6, 4)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 3)>
  - <9, (5, 8, 4)>
  - <9, (5, 8, 1)>
  - <9, (6, 4, 3)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 0)>
  - <9, (4, 8, 1)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (5, 9, 4)>
  - <6, (5, 9, 3)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 4)>
  - <6, (5, 4, 3)>
  - <6, (9, 7, 0)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (5, 9, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 9, 1)>
  - <4, (5, 8, 1)>
  - <4, (9, 2, 1)>
  - <4, (8, 1, 7)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (5, 9, 4)>
  - <8, (5, 9, 1)>
  - <8, (9, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 1, 7)>

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated from each node, we get a total of [54].
