Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the 3-star graph and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 26, 0, and 27.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 21, 24, and 15.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 25, 4, and 28.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 18, 25, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 16, 29, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 19, 21, and 27.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 20, 0, 21, and 11.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 26, 6, 24, and 12.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 15, 17, and 7.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 15, 23, and 14.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 21, and 10.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 19, and 16.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 5, 19, and 6.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 18, 29, and 27.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 13, 22, 8, and 26.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 26, 0 and 27.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 21, 15, and 24.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 25, 4, and 28.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 18, and 27.
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes 16, 29, and 10.
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 12, 19, and 21.
- Node 15 forms 3-stars with nodes 20, 0, and 11.
- Node 18 forms 3-stars with nodes 26, 6, and 12.
- Node 20 forms 3-stars with nodes 15, 7, and 17.
- Node 21 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 14, and 23.
- Node 23 forms 3-stars with nodes 8, 4, and 10.
- Node 24 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 18, and 19.
- Node 25 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 6, and 19.
- Node 26 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 29, and 27.

Considering the above information, the total number of 3-stars is 25. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 25, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 26, 0)>, <3, (1, 21, 15)>, <5, (25, 4, 28)>, <6, (2, 18, 27)>, <13, (16, 29, 10)>, <14, (2, 12, 19)>, <15, (20, 0, 11)>, <18, (26, 6, 12)>, <20, (15, 7, 17)>, <21, (3, 14, 23)>, <23, (8, 4, 10)>, <24, (3, 18, 19)>, <25, (5, 6, 19)>, <26, (1, 29, 27)>
