Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (29, 7) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 14) (23, 25) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (8, 5) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 26) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 7) (28, 20) (11, 28) (11, 15) (24, 0) (24, 4) (26, 23) (26, 21) (4, 24) (4, 27) (4, 25) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 13) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 25) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 15) (14, 1) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 21) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 23) (19, 17) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 20) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 16) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (20, 28) (20, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 9, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 3.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 6.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 21.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 23.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 25.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 26.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 28.

Adding up all the 3-stars for these nodes, we get a total of 36 3-stars [36].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (3, 14, 25)>
- <1, (3, 19, 23)>
- <1, (6, 12, 25)>
- <1, (21, 26, 28)>
- <3, (1, 19, 23)>
- <6, (9, 12, 25)>
- <21, (12, 26, 28)>
- <23, (19, 14, 25)>
- <25, (6, 4, 16)>
- <26, (21, 28, 16)>
- <28, (21, 7, 16)>
- <28, (21, 7, 20)>
