Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62\)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 10)>, <0, (3, 9, 13)>, <0, (3, 10, 13)>, <0, (4, 9, 13)>, <0, (4, 10, 13)>, <3, (0, 9, 10)>, <3, (0, 9, 13)>, <4, (0, 9, 10)>, <4, (0, 9, 13)>, <5, (2, 6, 12)>, <5, (2, 6, 14)>, <5, (2, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 12, 14)>, <9, (1, 7, 11)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 13)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 11, 6)>, <14, (6, 12, 3)>, <14, (6, 12, 5)>, <14, (6, 3, 12)>, <14, (6, 5, 12)>
