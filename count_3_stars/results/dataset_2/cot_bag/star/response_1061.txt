Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 13) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get:
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [31]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 11, 19)>
<1, (9, 12, 13)>
<3, (4, 6, 17)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 10)>
<8, (15, 19, 4)>
<10, (6, 17, 18)>
<11, (0, 13, 14)>
<15, (8, 14, 17)>
<17, (10, 15, 18)>
<18, (16, 17, 10)>
<19, (0, 8, 15)>
