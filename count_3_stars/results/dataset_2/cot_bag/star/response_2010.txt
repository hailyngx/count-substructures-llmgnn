Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 13) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 10) (25, 2) (22, 6) (23, 18) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 21) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 5) (4, 23) (4, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 29) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 28) (21, 9) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 15) (26, 5) (26, 15) (5, 27) (5, 26) (5, 29) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 29) (20, 9) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 20) (11, 7) (11, 15) (17, 28) (17, 24) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 19) (18, 23) (18, 27) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 21) (9, 20) (7, 8) (7, 28) (7, 11) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 11) (2, 25) (24, 12) (24, 17) (10, 25) (10, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes that have exactly three neighbors are nodes 3, 8, 4, 1, 27, 21, 16, 20, 29, 14, 15, 6, 7, 25, and 10. We will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 46 \)

So there are a total of 46 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [46] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 13, 25)>, <8, (0, 4, 14)>, <4, (0, 8, 12)>, <1, (0, 3, 14)>, <27, (5, 12, 21)>, <21, (9, 12, 27)>, <16, (15, 20, 29)>, <20, (3, 16, 29)>, <29, (5, 20, 16)>, <14, (1, 6, 8)>, <15, (11, 16, 26)>, <6, (14, 19, 22)>, <7, (10, 11, 28)>, <25, (2, 3, 27)>.
