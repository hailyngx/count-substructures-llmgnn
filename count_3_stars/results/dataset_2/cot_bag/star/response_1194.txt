Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, here is the representation of the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 10
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 10, 14
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 12
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 13
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 11, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 10, 13, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 12, 13

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- By counting the neighbors of each node, we find that nodes 3, 4, 5, 10, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors.
- For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
  - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 50 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (9, 10, 13)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 14)>, <10, (2, 3, 13)>, <13, (3, 6, 14)>
