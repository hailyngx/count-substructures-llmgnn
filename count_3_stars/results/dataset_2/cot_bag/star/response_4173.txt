Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 0)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 14)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 10), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 13)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 3), (6, 2)
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 0)
- Node 10: (10, 9), (10, 11), (10, 3), (10, 13)
- Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 13)
- Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 12), (13, 14), (13, 3)
- Node 14: (14, 7), (14, 11), (14, 6), (14, 12), (14, 2), (14, 13)

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 6: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 14: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node gives us: 96

So, there are a total of [96] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 1, 8)>
<1, (9, 0, 8)>
<1, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 0, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (9, 3, 14)>
<2, (9, 6, 14)>
<3, (5, 10, 6)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<3, (10, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (5, 0, 6)>
<9, (2, 10, 1)>
<9, (2, 10, 13)>
<9, (2, 6, 14)>
<10, (9, 11, 13)>
<11, (10, 14, 13)>
<13, (10, 14, 12)>
<13, (10, 14, 11)>
<13, (10, 14, 3)>
<14, (7, 11, 6)>
<14, (7, 11, 13)>
<14, (7, 12, 13)>
<14, (7, 12, 6)>
