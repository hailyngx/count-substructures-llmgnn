Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <0, (7, 13, 17)>, <0, (7, 16, 8)>, <0, (13, 16, 15)>, <0, (13, 16, 8)>, <0, (13, 18, 10)>, <0, (16, 15, 8)>, <0, (16, 15, 9)>, <0, (16, 15, 13)>, <0, (16, 15, 18)>, <0, (16, 8, 15)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <2, (5, 12, 14)>, <2, (5, 12, 3)>, <2, (5, 14, 4)>, <2, (5, 14, 8)>, <2, (12, 3, 6)>, <2, (12, 3, 14)>, <2, (12, 14, 4)>, <2, (3, 6, 17)>, <2, (3, 14, 8)>, <2, (3, 14, 12)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <3, (2, 12, 6)>, <3, (6, 12, 17)>, <3, (6, 17, 0)>, <3, (6, 17, 12)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 11)>, <7, (0, 1, 13)>, <7, (1, 11, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <8, (0, 14, 15)>, <8, (0, 14, 16)>, <8, (14, 15, 16)>, <8, (14, 15, 18)>

- Node 9: Only 1 3-star: <9, (4, 10, 11)>

- Node 10: Only 1 3-star: <10, (9, 11, 18)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <13, (0, 5, 18)>, <13, (0, 16, 15)>, <13, (5, 16, 19)>, <13, (16, 18, 19)>

- Node 14: Only 1 3-star: <14, (2, 4, 8)>

- Node 15: Only 1 3-star: <15, (8, 10, 16)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [44] \)
