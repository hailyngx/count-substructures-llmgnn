Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 17) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 25) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 21) (8, 27) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 21) (22, 16) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 15) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 18) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 11) (17, 24) (17, 18) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (27, 25) (27, 8) (26, 11) (26, 29) (26, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 19) (0, 3) (0, 12) (4, 9) (20, 8) (20, 21) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 20) (21, 14) (7, 1) (7, 24) (7, 28) (24, 17) (24, 29) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 18) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 24) (10, 25) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 10) (6, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 24) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 8, Node 13, and Node 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 8:
There is 1 3-star with Node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 19, 27)>

For Node 13:
There is 1 3-star with Node 13 as the center: <13, (5, 15, 18)>

For Node 16:
There is 1 3-star with Node 16 as the center: <16, (2, 6, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <8, (2, 19, 27)>, <13, (5, 15, 18)>, and <16, (2, 6, 22)>.
