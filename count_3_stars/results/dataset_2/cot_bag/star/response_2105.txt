Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (17, 5) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, and 19. 

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
12. Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars. So, the answer is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, 2, 14>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 7, 12>, <0, 9, 10>, <2, 7, 11>, <2, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 6>, <9, 12, 7>, <16, 1, 18>, <16, 6, 4>
