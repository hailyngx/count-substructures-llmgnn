Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 5) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 2, 18, 7, 12, 8, 0, 4, 5, 13, 19, 15, 16, 14, 17, 10, 11, 9, and 6.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes (3, 14, 19).
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes (1, 8, 11).
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes (18, 6, 11).
- Node 18 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 10, 13).
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes (12, 10, 14).
- Node 12 forms 3-stars with nodes (7, 10, 6).
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes (3, 11, 4).
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes (16, 15, 17).
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes (11, 6, 17).
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes (19, 17, 9).
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes (18, 9, 19).
- Node 19 forms 3-stars with nodes (1, 5, 9).
- Node 15 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 16, 14).
- Node 16 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 6, 10).
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes (1, 7, 15).
- Node 17 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 4, 5).
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with nodes (18, 7, 12).
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 8, 4).
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes (13, 19, 14).
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 12, 16).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes, we get 19 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 14, 19)>, <3, (1, 8, 11)>, <2, (18, 6, 11)>, <18, (2, 10, 13)>, <7, (12, 10, 14)>, <12, (7, 10, 6)>, <8, (3, 11, 4)>, <0, (16, 15, 17)>, <4, (11, 6, 17)>, <5, (19, 17, 9)>, <13, (18, 9, 19)>, <19, (1, 5, 9)>, <15, (0, 16, 14)>, <16, (0, 6, 10)>, <14, (1, 7, 15)>, <17, (0, 4, 5)>, <10, (18, 7, 12)>, <11, (2, 8, 4)>, <9, (13, 19, 14)>, <6, (2, 12, 16)>.
