Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and the specified 40 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars and identify them.

We will first find which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [52].

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:

- <5, (9, 4, 0)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <5, (9, 2, 7)>
- <5, (7, 4, 0)>
- <5, (7, 6, 8)>
- <5, (7, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 4, 7)>
- <9, (6, 5, 2)>
- <9, (6, 1, 8)>
- <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- <6, (5, 1, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 2)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <7, (9, 0, 5)>
- <7, (9, 4, 2)>
- <7, (4, 5, 2)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 7, 3)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
