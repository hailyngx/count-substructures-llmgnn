Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can find the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes.

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 62. 
Putting this number inside brackets: [62]

The unique 3-stars found are:
