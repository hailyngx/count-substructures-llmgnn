Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 22) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 8) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 22) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (4, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 24) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (20, 26) (20, 21) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 16) (29, 12) (29, 28) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 23) (16, 19) (3, 14) (3, 21) (25, 10) (25, 27) (5, 12) (5, 23) (2, 26) (2, 7) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 12) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 16) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 21) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 28.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 55 3-stars in the graph, which is represented as [55].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, 7, 21>, <7, 21, 0>, <7, 21, 20>, <21, 7, 0>, <10, 6, 28>, <10, 6, 18>, <10, 6, 19>, <11, 1, 24>, <11, 1, 13>, <11, 8, 4>, <12, 27, 25>, <14, 17, 22>, <16, 28, 19>, <19, 12, 27>, <19, 12, 22>, <19, 6, 10>, <21, 7, 0>, <21, 7, 22>, <21, 7, 2>, <21, 7, 13>, <23, 5, 12>, <23, 5, 15>, <24, 8, 11>, <24, 8, 4>, <28, 6, 10>, <28, 6, 19>, <28, 6, 18>.
