Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, in this graph, there are a total of [36] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 9, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (6, 9, 8)>
- <4, (5, 9, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 9, 4)>
- <6, (7, 9, 8)>
- <6, (9, 8, 0)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- <9, (6, 8, 5)>
