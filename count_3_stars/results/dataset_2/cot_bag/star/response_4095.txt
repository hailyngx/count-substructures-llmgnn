Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 3>.
