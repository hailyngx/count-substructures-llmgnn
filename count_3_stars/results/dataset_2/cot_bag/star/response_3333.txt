Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with a degree of 3 or more: nodes 6, 9, 10, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, hence there is 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, hence there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \), which we will write as [13].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<9, (6, 15, 13)>
<10, (3, 17, 19)>
<17, (10, 12, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 11)>
<6, (14, 18, 16)>
<9, (15, 19, 13)>
<9, (0, 13, 10)>
<10, (17, 5, 7)>
<17, (12, 8, 0)>
<17, (7, 11, 13)>
<17, (5, 7, 12)>
<17, (7, 12, 0)>
