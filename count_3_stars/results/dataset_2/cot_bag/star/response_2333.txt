Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 15) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 18) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 18) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 5) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 14.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <0, (7, 14, 17)>, <0, (7, 14, 12)>, <0, (14, 5, 12)>, <0, (17, 5, 12)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-stars: <4, (8, 11, 9)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars: <7, (14, 6, 2)>, <7, (14, 5, 2)>, <7, (14, 6, 18)>, <7, (14, 6, 18)>, <7, (14, 6, 18)>, <7, (14, 5, 6)>, <7, (14, 5, 6)>, <7, (14, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 17, 12)>, <7, (2, 16, 10)>

For node 14:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <14, (7, 5, 6)>, <14, (7, 5, 6)>, <14, (7, 5, 6)>, <14, (5, 17, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
