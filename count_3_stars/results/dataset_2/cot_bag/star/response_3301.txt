Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (7, 3, 5)>
  - <1, (7, 3, 10)>
  - <1, (7, 5, 12)>
  - <1, (1, 3, 5)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <2, (7, 3, 12)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (1, 11, 10)>
  - <3, (1, 2, 10)>
  - <3, (11, 8, 18)>
  - <3, (1, 11, 2)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (7, 13, 19)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (11, 0, 18)>
  - <8, (11, 14, 18)>
  - <8, (0, 14, 18)>
  - <8, (0, 14, 5)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (12, 15, 19)>
  - <9, (12, 15, 9)>
  - <9, (12, 9, 16)>
  - <9, (12, 9, 10)>
  - <9, (15, 9, 16)>
  - <9, (15, 9, 10)>
  - <9, (19, 16, 10)>
  - <9, (19, 16, 9)>
  - <9, (19, 10, 16)>
  - <9, (19, 10, 9)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <10, (1, 3, 13)>
  - <10, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <10, (1, 9, 10)>
  - <10, (9, 13, 10)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <11, (3, 8, 18)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <12, (2, 5, 0)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <13, (4, 6, 10)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <18, (11, 17, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars we found from each node: 
4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31].
