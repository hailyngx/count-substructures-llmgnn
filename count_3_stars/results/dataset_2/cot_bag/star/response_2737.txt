Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph are nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

Adding the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 2)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
