Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of \(4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 70\), so the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 14)>, <0, (4, 10, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 6)>, <1, (9, 13, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 12)>, <3, (11, 6, 4)>, <4, (0, 11, 6)>, <5, (7, 9, 12)>, <8, (2, 13, 3)>, <8, (2, 14, 3)>, <8, (8, 14, 13)>, <9, (1, 12, 4)>, <10, (0, 6, 4)>, <10, (6, 12, 4)>.
