Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 
Node 0 (with 5 neighbors), Node 1 (with 4 neighbors), Node 2 (with 5 neighbors), Node 3 (with 4 neighbors), Node 4 (with 4 neighbors), Node 5 (with 4 neighbors), Node 6 (with 4 neighbors), Node 7 (with 5 neighbors), Node 8 (with 4 neighbors), Node 10 (with 4 neighbors), Node 11 (with 5 neighbors), Node 12 (with 3 neighbors), Node 13 (with 3 neighbors), Node 14 (with 5 neighbors).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 10, 14)>, <3, (10, 12, 13)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 11)>, <8, (10, 11, 13)>, <10, (1, 2, 8)>, <11, (4, 7, 14)>.
