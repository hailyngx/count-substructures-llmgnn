Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 18) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 7) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 12, 16
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 12, 14, 15
- Node 3: 8, 16, 18, 19
- Node 4: 1, 15
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9, 10, 18
- Node 7: 10, 17, 18, 19
- Node 8: 3, 14
- Node 9: 5, 6, 11, 15
- Node 10: 6, 7, 19
- Node 11: 9, 13, 14
- Node 12: 0, 2, 14
- Node 13: 11
- Node 14: 2, 8, 11, 12
- Node 15: 2, 4, 9, 18
- Node 16: 0, 3, 17
- Node 17: 7, 16
- Node 18: 3, 6, 7, 15
- Node 19: 3, 7, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19}

For these 11 nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 -> 3 = [] 1  
- Node 3 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 6 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 7 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 9 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 11 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 14 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 15 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 16 -> 3 = [] 1  
- Node 18 -> 4 = [] 4  
- Node 19 -> 3 = [] 1  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [] 29. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 16, 12)>
<3, (8, 19, 18)>
<3, (8, 16, 18)>
<3, (16, 17, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 18)>
<6, (5, 9, 10)>
<6, (9, 18, 15)>
<7, (10, 19, 18)>
<7, (10, 19, 7)>
<7, (17, 16, 7)>
<7, (17, 16, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 15)>
<9, (5, 11, 15)>
<9, (9, 6, 10)>
<9, (9, 11, 15)>
<11, (13, 14, 9)>
<14, (2, 12, 14)>
<14, (2, 11, 14)>
<14, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (12, 2, 14)>
<15, (2, 18, 4)>
<15, (2, 18, 9)>
