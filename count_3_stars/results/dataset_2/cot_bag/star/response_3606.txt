Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's outline the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 14, 7, 10, 4
- Node 1: 10, 5, 8, 4
- Node 2: 7, 5, 4
- Node 3: 14, 11, 7, 12
- Node 4: 6, 0, 2, 1
- Node 5: 11, 2, 12, 8, 1
- Node 6: 9, 4, 0, 13
- Node 7: 9, 0, 3, 10, 2
- Node 8: 11, 5, 1
- Node 9: 6, 14, 10, 7
- Node 10: 9, 0, 14, 7, 1
- Node 11: 3, 13, 5, 8
- Node 12: 3, 13, 5
- Node 13: 6, 11, 12
- Node 14: 9, 0, 3, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 16.
Putting it all together: [16]
Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 6, 4, 14>
- <1, 10, 4, 5>
- <2, 7, 4, 5>
- <3, 11, 7, 14>
- <4, 0, 1, 6>
- <4, 1, 2, 5>
- <5, 1, 2, 8>
- <6, 0, 4, 13>
- <7, 0, 2, 4>
- <8, 1, 5, 11>
- <9, 7, 10, 14>
- <10, 1, 4, 5>
- <11, 13, 3, 5>
- <12, 13, 3, 5>
- <13, 12, 3, 11>
- <14, 9, 0, 3>
