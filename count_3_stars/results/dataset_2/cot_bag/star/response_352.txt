Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
We will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors based on the given edge list. Then, we will count the total number of 3-stars from those nodes.

From the given edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [1, 4, 5, 9]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [4, 6, 7, 9]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [0, 4, 5, 8]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [0, 5, 7, 9]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: [0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). (List of 3-stars will be long)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: [2, 3, 5, 8, 9]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). (List of 3-stars will be long)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [2, 4, 5, 6]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [0, 3, 4, 5, 1]. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). (List of 3-stars will be long)

Counting all the 3-stars from each node, we find a total of 58 3-stars. 

Putting this into brackets: [58].
