Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 nodes with 15 nodes having three or more neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
3. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
4. Node 13 has 8 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
6. Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
7. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
8. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
10. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
11. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
12. Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
13. Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
14. Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
15. Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars from each node:

\( 4 + 4 + 56 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 233 \)

In total, there are 233 3-stars in this graph.
