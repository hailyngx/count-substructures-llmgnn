Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
To begin, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - Node 0: {5, 9, 4, 1, 6}
  - Node 1: {7, 3, 2, 0}
  - Node 2: {4, 7, 1, 8}
  - Node 3: {1, 8}
  - Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 2}
  - Node 5: {9, 6, 0}
  - Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 0}
  - Node 7: {9, 4, 6, 2, 1}
  - Node 8: {9, 4, 3, 2, 6}
  - Node 9: {5, 8, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 neighbors => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 9, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>
