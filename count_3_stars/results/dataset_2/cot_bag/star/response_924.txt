Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Here is the list of such nodes along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 9, 11, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 13, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {12, 13, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 12, 17}
- Node 15: Neighbors {17, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 8, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 3, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars calculated for each node, we get: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 35\)

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's list them as follows:
<0, (6, 9, 18)>
<3, (5, 16, 18)>
<4, (5, 12, 17)>
<5, (3, 4, 19)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 8, 17)>
<10, (12, 13, 16)>
<12, (10, 11, 14)>
<14, (4, 12, 17)>
<16, (3, 8, 10)>
<17, (4, 14, 15)>
<18, (0, 3, 15)>
<19, (3, 5, 7)>
