Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (7, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) (15, 17) (15, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36\)

Therefore, the final answer is \([36]\). The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 9, 17)>, <1, (4, 9, 16)>, <1, (4, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 9, 17)>, <3, (4, 9, 18)>, <3, (4, 9, 1)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 16)>, <4, (3, 9, 1)>, <4, (3, 9, 18)>, <8, (1, 9, 16)>, <8, (1, 9, 19)>, <8, (9, 16, 13)>, <8, (9, 16, 1)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <9, (1, 4, 3)>, <9, (3, 4, 18)>, <10, (1, 5, 19)>, <10, (1, 5, 10)>, <10, (5, 14, 8)>, <10, (5, 14, 19)>, <13, (8, 16, 9)>, <13, (8, 16, 1)>, <13, (9, 16, 1)>, <14, (5, 10, 19)>, <14, (5, 10, 7)>, <14, (8, 5, 19)>, <14, (8, 5, 17)>, <16, (8, 9, 13)>, <17, (1, 5, 10)>, <17, (1, 5, 19)>, <17, (3, 5, 10)>, <17, (3, 5, 10)>, <17, (5, 10, 15)>
