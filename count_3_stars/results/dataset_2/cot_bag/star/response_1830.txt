Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 7) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 1: This node has 2 neighbors (2, 3). So, no 3-star is formed with Node 1.

For Node 2: This node has 5 neighbors (1, 7, 9, 11, 12). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 

For Node 3: This node has 7 neighbors (1, 8, 13, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

For Node 4: This node has 5 neighbors (0, 6, 14, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (8, 13, 12, 14). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For Node 7: This node has 5 neighbors (11, 6, 10, 9, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 8: This node has 6 neighbors (3, 13, 9, 5, 10, 11). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For Node 9: This node has 5 neighbors (8, 2, 10, 7). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 10: This node has 5 neighbors (8, 0, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 10 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 11: This node has 5 neighbors (8, 7, 12, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 11 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 12: This node has 5 neighbors (5, 0, 14, 2). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 12 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For Node 13: This node has 6 neighbors (3, 8, 14, 5). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 13 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For Node 14: This node has 5 neighbors (13, 5, 12, 4). So, the number of 3-stars with Node 14 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up all the 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 149 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [149]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 8, 13)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 14)>, 
<5, (8, 13, 12)>, 
<7, (11, 6, 10)>, 
<8, (3, 13, 9)>, 
<9, (8, 2, 10)>, 
<10, (8, 0, 7)>, 
<11, (8, 7, 12)>, 
<12, (5, 0, 14)>, 
<13, (3, 8, 14)>, 
<14, (13, 5, 12)>.
