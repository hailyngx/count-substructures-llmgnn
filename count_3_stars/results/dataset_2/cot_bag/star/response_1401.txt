Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 6) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 22) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (18, 20) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 13) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 12) (26, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 23) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 28) (3, 16) (3, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 27) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 14) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 26) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (29, 7) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (27, 24) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 9) (23, 0) (23, 9) 

Response:
The central nodes with at least three neighbors are: 20, 25, 10, 11, 17, 2, 18, 15, 26, 7, 16, 22, 5, 14, 6, 0, 24, 8, 9, 13, 12, 23. 
        For each of these central nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
        - For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
        - For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
        - For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - For node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

        Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
        \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 52 \)
        
        So, there are 52 3-stars in this graph.
        
        Thus, the final answer is: \[ 52 \] 
        
        The unique 3-stars found are: 
        <20, 15, 10, 11>, 
        <25, 5, 26, 6>, 
        <11, 14, 13, 5>, 
        <2, 1, 6, 28>, 
        <6, 1, 26, 12>, 
        <26, 12, 9, 6>, 
        <0, 7, 23, 28>, 
        <7, 0, 24, 28>, 
        <0, 24, 27, 28>, 
        <7, 24, 8, 28>, 
        <9, 10, 23, 12>, 
        <16, 3, 13, 8>, 
        <13, 11, 19, 14>.
