Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we get [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <10, (11, 1, 8)>
- <10, (6, 1, 17)>
- <10, (6, 8, 18)>
- <11, (10, 5, 2)>
- <6, (10, 1, 17)>
- <6, (15, 2, 4)>
- <6, (15, 4, 7)>
- <6, (17, 7, 15)>
- <15, (13, 2, 4)>
- <15, (13, 4, 7)>
- <15, (6, 2, 4)>
- <15, (6, 4, 7)>
