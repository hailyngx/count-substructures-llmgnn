Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are connected in the following way:

Node 0: 1, 3, 2, 7
Node 1: 3, 0, 2, 8, 7
Node 2: 6, 1, 4, 5, 0
Node 3: 1, 0, 5, 8
Node 4: 6, 9, 5, 2
Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 2, 7
Node 6: 7, 2, 4
Node 7: 6, 1, 5, 0
Node 8: 9, 1, 3, 5
Node 9: 8, 4

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 5)>, <1, (3, 0, 5)>, <1, (7, 6, 5)>, <1, (7, 5, 0)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>.
