Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 4, 7, 9
2: 0, 8, 12, 13
3: 0, 6, 7, 8, 14
4: 1, 6, 8, 9, 10
5: 0, 8, 10
6: 3, 4, 7
7: 1, 3, 6, 9, 10
8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 14
9: 1, 4, 7, 10, 11
10: 4, 5, 7, 9, 12
11: 0, 9
12: 0, 2, 10, 13
13: 2, 12, 14
14: 3, 8, 13

Let's find the total number of 3-stars. 

For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
- <4, (1, 5, 6)> 
- <4, (1, 6, 8)> 
- <4, (1, 8, 9)> 
- <4, (5, 8, 10)>

For node 8, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
- <8, (2, 5, 14)> 
- <8, (2, 12, 13)> 
- <8, (2, 13, 14)> 
- <8, (3, 4, 14)> 
- <8, (3, 5, 14)> 
- <8, (3, 6, 14)> 
- <8, (4, 5, 14)> 
- <8, (4, 8, 14)> 
- <8, (5, 8, 14)> 
- <8, (6, 8, 14)>

For node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
- <9, (1, 7, 10)>
- <9, (4, 7, 10)> 
- <9, (4, 7, 1)> 
- <9, (7, 10, 11)> 
- <9, (7, 10, 4)> 
- <9, (7, 10, 1)> 
- <9, (7, 10, 9)> 
- <9, (7, 11, 1)> 
- <9, (7, 11, 10)>
- <9, (10, 11, 1)>

For node 10, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
- <10, (4, 7, 9)>
- <10, (5, 7, 9)> 
- <10, (5, 7, 12)> 
- <10, (7, 9, 11)> 
- <10, (7, 9, 12)> 
- <10, (7, 9, 4)> 
- <10, (7, 9, 5)> 
- <10, (7, 12, 5)> 
- <10, (7, 12, 9)> 
- <10, (9, 11, 12)>

In total, there are 34 3-stars: 4 from node 4, 10 from node 8, 10 from node 9, and 10 from node 10.
So the final answer is [34].
