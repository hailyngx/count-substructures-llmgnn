Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes, we'll first represent it visually:

          1 - 2
         / \ / \
        3 - 4 - 5
         \ / \ /
          6 - 7
               |
               8
               |
               9
               |
               0

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 9, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 7, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {7, 3, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 6, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 3, 2}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 3, 6}
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6}

For each of the identified nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars we get: 10 + 35 + 35 + 10 + 10 = 100

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [100].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
