Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we will identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Let's start by examining each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9, 4, 2, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {13, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 7, 10, 6, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {6, 0, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 0, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {14, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {14, 13, 0}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {3, 5, 4, 2, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 5, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {14}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {9, 2, 11, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {8, 9, 12, 13, 10}

Nodes with at least three neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up these results, the total number of 3-stars is   [98].

<0, (1,5,2)>
<0, (1,9,4)>
<0, (1,9,2)>
<0, (1,4,2)>
<0, (5,9,4)>
<0, (5,9,2)>
<0, (5,4,2)>
<1, (3,6,11)>
<2, (13,10,7)>
<3, (7,10,6)>
<5, (11,13,0)>
<13, (9,14,0)>
<13, (2,11,14)>
<13, (2,14,10)>
<14, (8,12,13)>
<14, (8,13,10)>
