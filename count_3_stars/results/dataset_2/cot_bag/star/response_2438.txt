Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (19, 4) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 8) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 10) (2, 14) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 6) (11, 17) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 16.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
6. Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
7. Node 12 has 2 neighbors -> 0 3-stars
8. Node 13 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
9. Node 14 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
10. Node 16 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (7, 12, 16)>, <3, (5, 9, 15)>, <4, (18, 13, 19)>, <6, (3, 8, 11)>, <7, (1, 8, 12)>, <9, (0, 3, 15)>, <13, (4, 10, 16)>, <14, (0, 2, 18)>, <16, (1, 13, 17)>.
