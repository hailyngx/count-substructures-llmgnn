Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 7) (3, 27) (3, 24) (3, 10) (7, 27) (7, 17) (12, 15) (6, 21) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 2) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 20) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 0) (26, 17) (1, 9) (1, 22) (2, 21) (2, 26) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 20) (28, 4) (28, 13) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (29, 6) (29, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 22) (23, 5) (23, 0) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 17) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 11) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 25) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 10) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (0, 26) (0, 23) (0, 25) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 16) (20, 22) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 26, 23, 25, 0, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 27, 24, 10, 3, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 27, 28, 20, 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 16, 23, 25, 22, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 21, 17, 29, 6, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 25, 5, 1, 13, 9, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 21, 9, 28, 11, 13, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 26, 20, 14, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 22, 5, 20, 16, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 7, 6, 26, 19, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 29, 24, 10, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 16, 22, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 6, 13, 2, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: 1, 16, 5, 20, 22, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 3, 18, 25, 24, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 24, 5, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 14, 2, 0, 17, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 15, 4, 7, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 18, 19, 6, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 70 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].
