Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. We'll then calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 74 \).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 13)>
- <0, (1, 4, 13)>
- <0, (3, 9, 13)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 13)>
- <2, (3, 4, 13)>
- <2, (1, 9, 13)>
- <2, (4, 9, 13)>
- <3, (0, 8, 13)>
- <4, (1, 2, 11)>
- <5, (6, 10, 13)>
- <9, (10, 12, 14)>
