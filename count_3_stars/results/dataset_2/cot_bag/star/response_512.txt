Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {7, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 0, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 3}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 3, 1, 7}

Next, we'll list the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 4)>
2. Node 3: <3, (5, 9, 4)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
\[
\binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 + 1 = 2
\]

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
