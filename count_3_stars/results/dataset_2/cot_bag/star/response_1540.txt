Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 3) (1, 21) (1, 11) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 18) (21, 2) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (15, 7) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 6) (17, 23) (29, 27) (29, 0) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 6) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 0) (2, 21) (2, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 18) (0, 29) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 5) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 24) (11, 1) (14, 13) (14, 26) (25, 16) (25, 0) (25, 4) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 27) (24, 5) (3, 22) (27, 29) (27, 24) (27, 5) (27, 6) (12, 18) (9, 13) (9, 15) (5, 0) (5, 24) (5, 27) (5, 4) (23, 17) (28, 22) (28, 15) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 12) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 5) (6, 20) (6, 26) (6, 27) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 13: (22, 9, 14, 7, 18)
- Node 22: (13, 28, 24, 3)
- Node 21: (1, 7, 8, 18, 2)
- Node 7: (13, 21, 16, 15)
- Node 15: (7, 20, 26, 9, 28)
- Node 20: (15, 6)
- Node 19: (8, 10, 16)
- Node 16: (7, 19, 24, 25, 18)
- Node 0: (29, 8, 10, 25, 5)
- Node 10: (19, 0, 24)
- Node 14: (13, 26)
- Node 26: (15, 14, 6)
- Node 8: (21, 19, 0)
- Node 2: (21, 4)
- Node 16: (7, 25, 0)
- Node 24: (22, 16, 10, 27, 5)
- Node 27: (29, 24, 5, 6)
- Node 5: (0, 24, 27, 4)

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in using \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node gives us \[ [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [90] \]

So, there are 90 unique 3-star subgraphs in this graph, and some of them include:
<13, (22, 9, 14, 7, 18)>
<22, (13, 28, 24, 3)>
<21, (1, 7, 8, 18, 2)>
<7, (13, 21, 16, 15)>
<15, (7, 20, 26, 9, 28)>
<19, (8, 10, 16)>
<16, (7, 19, 24, 25, 18)>
<0, (29, 8, 10, 25, 5)>
... and more.
