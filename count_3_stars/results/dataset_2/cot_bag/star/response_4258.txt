Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (16, 24) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (23, 24) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 9) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (24, 14) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 29) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 25) (28, 22) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 5) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 21) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 24) (14, 7) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 2) (9, 23) (9, 13) (9, 1) (6, 22) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 27) (29, 4) (29, 25) (19, 3) (19, 1) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

From the given edges, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 1
- Node 29: degree 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these 3-stars gives us:
\( [4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [60] \)

Therefore, there are 60 unique 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as:
<2, (3, 15, 18)>, <3, (2, 15, 21)>, <4, (7, 8, 17)>, <7, (4, 14, 21)>, <12, (2, 17, 25)>, <14, (4, 7, 15)>, <15, (3, 14, 24)>, <21, (3, 4, 25)>, <22, (6, 12, 23)>, <23, (7, 8, 24)>, <24, (14, 15, 23)>, <25, (7, 12, 21)>
