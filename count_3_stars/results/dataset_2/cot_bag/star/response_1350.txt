Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 17) (15, 5) (15, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 13) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 10) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 16) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following graph:

```
20 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) 
(18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 5) 
(12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11)
(8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 17) (15, 5) (15, 9) 
(17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 13) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 10) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) 
(19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 16)
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern:
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 19) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <1, (3, 2, 19)>
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 16), (2, 10) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <2, (1, 18, 12)>
- Node 4: (4, 19), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 11) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <4, (19, 13, 10)>
- Node 7: (7, 18), (7, 0), (7, 19) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <7, (18, 0, 19)>
- Node 8: (8, 10), (8, 16), (8, 11), (8, 6) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <8, (10, 16, 11)>
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 15), (9, 11) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <9, (0, 14, 15)>
- Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 16) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <10, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 11: (11, 18), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 9) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <11, (18, 4, 8)>
- Node 12: (12, 2), (12, 17) -> Total 3-Stars: [0]
- Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 17) -> Total 3-Stars: [0]
- Node 15: (15, 5), (15, 9) -> Total 3-Stars: [0]
- Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 8), (16, 10) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <16, (2, 8, 10)>
- Node 17: (17, 18), (17, 12), (17, 13) -> Total 3-Stars: [0]
- Node 18: (18, 2), (18, 11), (18, 7), (18, 17) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <18, (2, 11, 7)>
- Node 19: (19, 1), (19, 7), (19, 4) -> Total 3-Stars: [1] <19, (1, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
