Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. Based on the information given, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:  
- Node 0: degree 4  
- Node 1: degree 3  
- Node 2: degree 4  
- Node 3: degree 2  
- Node 4: degree 3  
- Node 5: degree 4  
- Node 6: degree 5  
- Node 7: degree 4  
- Node 8: degree 6  
- Node 9: degree 4  

Let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:
- Nodes 6 and 8 have 5 and 6 neighbors respectively.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 20] = 30 \).

Here are the unique 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 2, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 0)>
- <6, (8, 0, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 3)>
- <8, (6, 3, 4)>
- <8, (6, 4, 0)>
- <8, (6, 0, 2)>
- <8, (6, 2, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 0)>
- <8, (3, 0, 8)>
- <8, (4, 0, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 9, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 3)>
- <8, (4, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 0, 8)>
- <8, (2, 8, 6)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 3)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
