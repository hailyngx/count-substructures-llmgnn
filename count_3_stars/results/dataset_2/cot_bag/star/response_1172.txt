Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with at least three neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 12, 2, 3, 11, 0, 10, 1, 14, 9, 13, 6

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [62]

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (3, 11, 6)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (6, 12, 11)>, <4, (6, 12, 10)>, <7, (12, 13, 0)>, <7, (12, 13, 10)>, <8, (14, 1, 9)>, <12, (7, 13, 10)>, <3, (4, 11, 6)>, <3, (8, 0, 10)>, <3, (11, 1, 5)>, <3, (11, 6, 10)>, <11, (4, 2, 6)>, <11, (6, 10, 13)>, <0, (8, 10, 13)>, <10, (12, 0, 13)>, <1, (11, 5, 14)>, <9, (2, 0, 1)>, <13, (7, 0, 10)>, <6, (4, 11, 10)>
