Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (9, 15) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 12) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 8) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 10) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 7, and node 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes.

Node 4:
- Connected to nodes 7, 19, and 2. There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 19, 2)>

Node 7:
- Connected to nodes 9, 4, 15, 10. There are 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 4, 15)>

Node 12:
- Connected to nodes 4, 6, 1, 11. There are 2 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (4, 6, 1)> and <12, (4, 11, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 2] = [4]
