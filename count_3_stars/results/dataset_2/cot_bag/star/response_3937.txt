Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (9, 7) (9, 11) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (6, 11, 12)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 13)>
<3, (2, 7, 13)>
<4, (3, 10, 13)>
<4, (10, 13, 14)>
<5, (10, 12, 14)>
<5, (12, 13, 14)>
