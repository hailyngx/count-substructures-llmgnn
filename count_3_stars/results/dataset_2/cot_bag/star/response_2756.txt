Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

For node 0:
- It has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 4, 9.
- It can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 8, 6)>.

For node 1:
- It has 4 neighbors: 6, 2, 4, 7.
- It can form 1 3-star: <1, (6, 2, 4)>.

For node 2:
- It has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9, 4.
- It can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>.

For node 4:
- It has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 0, 9.
- It can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 0)>.

For node 5:
- It has 6 neighbors: 3, 6, 2, 8, 7.
- It can form 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 2)>.

For node 6:
- It has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 0.
- It can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 8)>.

For node 8:
- It has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 0.
- It can form 1 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 8, 6)>
- <1, (6, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 0)>
- <5, (3, 6, 2)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 2)>
