Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 22) (16, 27) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 5) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 18) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 24) (26, 10) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 22) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 28) (17, 6) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 27) (3, 18) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 18) (25, 11) (25, 0) (4, 2) (12, 2) (12, 18) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 20) (10, 26) (10, 23) (10, 24) (10, 5) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 12) (28, 8) (28, 23) (28, 0) (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 20) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 20) (27, 16) (27, 29) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 13) (20, 19) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 14) (14, 1) (14, 24) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 5) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 27) (5, 22) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \) potential 3-stars in this graph. Let's now list the unique 3-stars formed:

- <1, 11, 21>
- <1, 11, 25>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <21, 1, 7>
- <21, 1, 13>
- <21, 1, 5>
- <6, 17, 29>
- <23, 10, 28>
- <2, 4, 15>
- <2, 4, 20>
- <2, 12, 18>
- <10, 26, 24>
- <18, 6, 9>
- <18, 3, 0>
- <18, 3, 12>
- <18, 3, 4>
- <18, 12, 4>
- <18, 12, 15>
- <18, 12, 20>
- <27, 16, 29>
- <15, 17, 24>
- <15, 17, 5>
- <15, 17, 2>
- <15, 17, 19>
- <15, 5, 27>
- <5, 21, 7>
- <5, 21, 13>
- <5, 21, 27>
- <5, 21, 22>    

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
