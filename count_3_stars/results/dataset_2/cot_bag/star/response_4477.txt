Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars.

We will first list out the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 11
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9, 11
- Node 2: 0, 4, 11, 14
- Node 3: 8, 13
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 13
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 11, 12
- Node 6: 4, 8, 13
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 10, 14
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 11
- Node 9: 1, 10, 11, 13, 14
- Node 10: 7, 9, 12, 13
- Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 12: 5, 10, 14
- Node 13: 3, 4, 6, 9, 10
- Node 14: 2, 7, 9, 12

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 7, 11)>
<2, (0, 11, 14)>
<4, (2, 5, 13)>
<5, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (1, 5, 14)>
<8, (3, 6, 13)>
<9, (10, 11, 14)>
<10, (7, 9, 13)>
<11, (0, 5, 9)>
<12, (5, 10, 14)> 
<13, (4, 6, 10)>
<14, (7, 9, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [47].
