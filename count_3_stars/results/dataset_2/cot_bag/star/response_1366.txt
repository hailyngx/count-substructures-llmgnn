Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to first identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 3, 9, 8, 2
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 7, 6, 9, 3
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 0
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 3
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 2, 0
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 1, 2
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 1
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 7, 9, 0
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 0

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 8: No 3-stars formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- For node 9: No 3-stars formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are given below:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 4, 2)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (9, 1, 4)>, 
<0, (8, 7, 3)>, 
<1, (7, 6, 3)>, 
<1, (6, 2, 5)>, 
<1, (9, 3, 7)>, 
<3, (4, 7, 1)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 3)>, 
<5, (6, 4, 2)>, 
<6, (7, 4, 1)>
