Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 72

So, there are 72 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 3)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (7, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 0, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (8, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (9, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 7, 8)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].
