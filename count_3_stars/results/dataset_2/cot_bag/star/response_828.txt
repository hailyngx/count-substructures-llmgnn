Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 1, 3, 12, 0, 14, 5, 6, 2, 8, 13, 11, 7, and 4.

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1,3), (1,6), (1,2). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3,1), (3,11), (3,7), (3,14), (3,9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (12,13), (12,5), (12,8). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0,14), (0,10), (0,13). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (14,3), (14,0), (14,2). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5,12), (5,13), (5,2), (5,10). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6,1), (6,11), (6,8), (6,4). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2,1), (2,14), (2,5), (2,8), (2,4). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8,7), (8,12), (8,6), (8,2), (8,9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (13,12), (13,0), (13,5), (13,4), (13,11). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (11,3), (11,7), (11,6), (11,13), (11,4). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7,3), (7,11), (7,10), (7,8). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4,6), (4,2), (4,13), (4,11), (4,10). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars found for each node: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 6, 2)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 14)>, 
<12, (13, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (14, 10, 13)>, 
<14, (3, 0, 2)>, 
<5, (12, 13, 2)>, 
<6, (1, 11, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (7, 12, 6)>, 
<13, (12, 0, 5)>, 
<11, (3, 7, 13)>, 
<7, (3, 11, 10)>, 
<4, (6, 2, 13)>.
