Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {10, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 12, 13)>
- <2, (6, 7, 12)>
- <6, (3, 8, 10)>
- <8, (1, 9, 13)>
- <10, (5, 11, 14)>
- <11, (4, 8, 12)>
- <12, (0, 4, 9)>
- <13, (1, 7, 10)>
