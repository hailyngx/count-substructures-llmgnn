Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (3, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 120

So, there are a total of 120 3-stars in this graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets: [120]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 4, 10>, 
<0, 4, 12>, 
<0, 1, 6>, 
<0, 1, 7>, 
<0, 1, 5>, 
<0, 1, 2>, 
<1, 2, 4>, 
<1, 2, 7>, 
<1, 2, 10>, 
<1, 2, 12>, 
<4, 7, 10>, 
<4, 7, 2>, 
<4, 7, 1>, 
<6, 5, 1>, 
<6, 5, 3>,

<14, 9, 12>
