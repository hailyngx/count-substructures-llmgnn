Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 5
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 4, 7, 1
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 4
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 9, 0, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 4, 0
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 2
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 9, 2
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up these, we have: \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 80 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 8, 4)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (8, 9, 2)>
- <2, (6, 7, 0)>
