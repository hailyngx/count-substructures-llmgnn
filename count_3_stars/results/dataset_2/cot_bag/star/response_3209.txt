Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 21) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 24) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 19) (24, 6) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 25) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 27) (0, 3) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 20) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 7) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 4) (4, 28) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 10, 11, 8, 23, 5, 6, 26, 13, 9, 22, 23, 2, 19, 18, 7, 21, 25, 12, 16, 20, 27, and 17.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 53 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (15, 19, 0)>, <10, (11, 21, 25)>, <23, (10, 8, 26)>, <5, (6, 13, 21)>, <26, (23, 28, 2)>, <13, (5, 25, 0)>, <9, (10, 22, 18)>, <2, (22, 19, 7)>, <19, (1, 2, 25)>, <7, (3, 8, 2)>, <25, (11, 8, 13)>, <21, (11, 23, 5)>, <16, (18, 20, 27)>, and <20, (26, 21, 16)>.
