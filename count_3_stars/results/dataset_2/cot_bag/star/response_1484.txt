Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 14) (4, 9) (13, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9, 15, 12
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3, 0, 7, 8, 2, 18
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 17, 14

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For nodes with 5 neighbors: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For nodes with 4 neighbors: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For nodes with 3 neighbors: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Adding these up, we get: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 \]

So, there are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (16, 0, 15)>
<17, (0, 12, 18)>
<14, (18, 19, 17)>
<3, (1, 10, 8)>
<7, (0, 11, 6)>
<8, (12, 10, 2)>
<2, (0, 12, 15)>
<18, (17, 3, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 15)>
<15, (10, 5, 2)>
<0, (2, 17, 7)>
<12, (8, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<6, (12, 1, 7)>
<11, (1, 13, 7)>

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we have [15].
