Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 8) (19, 11) (19, 7) (8, 18) (8, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: (10, 15, 12, 3)
- Node 4: (17, 18, 12, 13, 2)
- Node 5: (9, 17, 7)
- Node 7: (5, 14, 18, 19, 13)
- Node 9: (16, 5, 2)
- Node 13: (14, 6, 4, 7)
- Node 18: (4, 7, 3, 8)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 15, 12, 3)>
<4, (17, 18, 12, 13, 2)>
<5, (9, 17, 7)>
<7, (5, 14, 18, 19, 13)>
<9, (16, 5, 2)>
<13, (14, 6, 4, 7)>
<18, (4, 7, 3, 8)>
