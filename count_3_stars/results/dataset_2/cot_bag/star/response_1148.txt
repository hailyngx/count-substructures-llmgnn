Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 20) (25, 6) (25, 3) (25, 21) (0, 3) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 27) (20, 18) (1, 28) (26, 4) (26, 22) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 12) (22, 26) (22, 2) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 17) (13, 11) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 29) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 8) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 21) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 5) (16, 7) (16, 27) (23, 15) (23, 24) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 17) (24, 18) (29, 5) (29, 10) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 15) (17, 5) (17, 24) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 18) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 21) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 14) (18, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 7, 3, 25, 28, 12, 10, 15, 2, 22, 5, 27, 20, 21, 18, 24, 29, 8, 17, and 11.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node gives us a total of 46 3-stars. 
\[ 46 \]
