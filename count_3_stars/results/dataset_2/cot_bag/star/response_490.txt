Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) 

Response:
There are eight nodes with more than three neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 3, there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are 2 possible 3-stars.
- For node 10, there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 11, there are 0 possible 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are 1 possible 3-stars.
- For node 17, there are 4 possible 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for these nodes, we get 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 18.

Therefore, the final answer is [18]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, (15, 7, 9)>
<3, (15, 12, 17)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<4, (7, 10, 5)>
<5, (1, 11, 10)>
<5, (1, 14, 10)>
<6, (13, 1, 18)>
<6, (13, 1, 19)>
<10, (8, 6, 17)>
<10, (8, 6, 13)>
<10, (8, 6, 1)>
<10, (8, 6, 19)>
<17, (12, 15, 18)>
<17, (12, 15, 1)>
<17, (12, 18, 1)>
<17, (15, 3, 9)>
