Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 18) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 17) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 18) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 8, 3, 11, 10, 15, 13, 17, 9, 7, 16, 12, 18, 5, 0, 14, 6, 1, 4 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
11. Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
12. Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
13. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 0: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
16. Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
17. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
19. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 18)>, <3, (0, 3, 9)>, <11, (3, 5, 7)>, <10, (4, 6, 15)>, <15, (5, 10, 17)>, <13, (4, 7, 11)>, <17, (15, 17, 18)>, <9, (2, 8, 16)>, <7, (11, 13, 7)>, <16, (5, 9, 16)>, <12, (2, 12, 14)>, <18, (1, 8, 17)>, <5, (2, 11, 15)>, <14, (6, 12, 14)>, <6, (4, 6, 10)>.
