Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can then calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

The nodes and their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: {2, 14, 5, 13, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 0, 9, 7}
- Node 3: {14, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 2, 11, 0}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 2, 11, 10, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {8, 6, 0, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 0, 11, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: 

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 82 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [82].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 14)>, <1, (5, 13, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 7)>, <7, (5, 13, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 1, 14)>, <7, (13, 11, 1)>, <11, (8, 6, 7)>, <13, (1, 11, 3)>.
