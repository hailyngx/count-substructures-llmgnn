Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 5) (8, 0) (8, 11) (13, 18) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 23) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (29, 16) (29, 21) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 19) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 22) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 27) (22, 6) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 19) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 20) (23, 0) (23, 12) (23, 11) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 24) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 21) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 21) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 17) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (24, 7) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (25, 2) (4, 10) (4, 20) (17, 2) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 7, and node 28.

For node 0:
It has 4 neighbors: 12, 18, 8, 23
Number of 3-stars formed with node 0 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (12, 18, 8)>, <0, (12, 18, 23)>, <0, (12, 8, 23)>, <0, (18, 8, 23)>

For node 7:
It has 4 neighbors: 12, 24, 28, 27
Number of 3-stars formed with node 7 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (12, 24, 28)>, <7, (12, 24, 27)>, <7, (12, 28, 27)>, <7, (24, 28, 27)>

For node 28:
It has 4 neighbors: 15, 7, 6, 14
Number of 3-stars formed with node 28 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<28, (15, 7, 6)>, <28, (15, 7, 14)>, <28, (15, 6, 14)>, <28, (7, 6, 14)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars calculated from the nodes: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
