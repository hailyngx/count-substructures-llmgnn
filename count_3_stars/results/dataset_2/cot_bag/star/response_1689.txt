Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 15) (5, 10) (5, 11) (13, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 13) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (4, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 15) (6, 12) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 16) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 16) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
There are 22 nodes with at least 3 neighbors in this graph, namely: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up these totals, we get: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36], and they are as follows:
<0, 7, 19>, <2, 10, 11>, <3, 1, 17>, <8, 2, 19>, <8, 14, 16>, <14, 16, 18>, <12, 15, 19>
