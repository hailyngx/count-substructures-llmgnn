Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors, node 4 and node 7. These are the potential center nodes for forming 3-stars.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 7, 12, and 9.
Node 7 has 8 neighbors: 4, 11, 10, 2, 5, 8, 1, and 3.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 4.

For node 7:
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]
So, there are 56 3-stars centered at node 7.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 (from node 4) + 56 (from node 7) = 57.

Hence, the final answer is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<7, (4, 11, 10)>
<7, (4, 11, 2)>
