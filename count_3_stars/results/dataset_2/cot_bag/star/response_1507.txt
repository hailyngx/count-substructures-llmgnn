Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 2) (27, 1) (3, 26) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 19) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 5) (12, 5) (10, 17) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (9, 18) (9, 22) (24, 18) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 2) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (28, 8) (28, 1) (23, 2) (23, 29) (1, 27) (1, 28) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 13) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (8, 26) (8, 28) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 29) (14, 10) (14, 6) (2, 15) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 7) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (21, 25) (21, 4) (21, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (5, 22) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 4) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (19, 20) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26

The unique 3-stars are:
<15, 2, 4>,
<18, 6, 1>,
<18, 6, 14>,
<18, 6, 19>,
<18, 9, 22>,
<18, 24, 4>,
<18, 24, 7>,
<18, 24, 2>,
<20, 4, 21>,
<22, 9, 5>,
<24, 7, 26>,
<25, 20, 4>,
<25, 20, 21>,
<25, 21, 4>,
<26, 2, 7>,
<26, 2, 23>,
<26, 7, 29>,
<29, 0, 18>,

The total number of 3-stars is [26].
