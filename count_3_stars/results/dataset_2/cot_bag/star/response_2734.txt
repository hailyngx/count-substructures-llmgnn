Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 is connected to: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1 is connected to: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 2 is connected to: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
Node 3 is connected to: {0, 5}
Node 4 is connected to: {1, 2, 8}
Node 5 is connected to: {0, 3, 7, 9}
Node 6 is connected to: {0, 2, 7, 9}
Node 7 is connected to: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
Node 8 is connected to: {4, 9}
Node 9 is connected to: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62.

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>.
