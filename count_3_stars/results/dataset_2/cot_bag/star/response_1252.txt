Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 8, 2
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 0
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 5, 2
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 2
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 0
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 4, 2
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 5, 0
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes gives a total of \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56 \) 3-stars.  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
