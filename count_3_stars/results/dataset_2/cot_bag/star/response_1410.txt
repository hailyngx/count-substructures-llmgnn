Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 2) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 10, 5, 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 14, 2, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 2, 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 12, 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 0, 13, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 0, 7, 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 8, 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 11, 5, 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 4, 5.

Identifying nodes with three or more neighbors, we find the following:

- Node 1, 3, 7, 8, 12, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these identified nodes:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (6, 9, 13)>, <8, (1, 11, 12)>, <12, (6, 11, 8)>, <14, (3, 11, 4)>.
