Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 16) (12, 10) (9, 7) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 0) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (13, 14) (0, 19) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 1, 6, 8, 11, 16, 14, 7, 10, 19, 17, 5, and 0.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 11, 17)>
<6, (1, 15, 18)>
<8, (4, 14, 16)>
<7, (1, 10, 16)>
<10, (2, 7, 12)>
<19, (0, 4, 15)>
<17, (3, 6, 18)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<0, (2, 5, 19)>
