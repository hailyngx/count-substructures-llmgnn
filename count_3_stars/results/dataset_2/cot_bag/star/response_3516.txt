Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) 

Response:
We'll first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 2, and 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 2, and 1
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 13, 10, and 2
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 11, and 14
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 2, 5, 11, and 0
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 6, 9, 4, 8, 12, and 14
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 8, 3, 5, and 13
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 10, and 3
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 1, 13, and 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 0, and 12
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 9 and 11
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 8, 0, 12, 11, and 14
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 4, 0, and 11
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 12, and 14
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 5, and 10

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 85 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [85]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (3, 2, 9)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 11, 14)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <0, (8, 3, 5)>, <12, (2, 5, 10)>, <11, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (8, 0, 12)>, <13, (4, 0, 11)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <14, (7, 2, 5)>
