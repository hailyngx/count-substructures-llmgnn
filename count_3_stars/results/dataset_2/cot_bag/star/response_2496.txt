Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 1) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) 

Response:
With 20 nodes and 60 edges given, we can construct the graph as described below:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 12.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 17, 2, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 13, 1, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 0, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 10, 19, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 3, 7, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7 and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 17, 15, and 2.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 16 and 14.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 19, and 15.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14 and 1.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 19, and 16.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 18, and 1.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (4, 9, 19)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 7)
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with (1, 15, 19)
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with (1, 16, 18)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <6, (4, 9, 19)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <16, (1, 15, 19)>, and <19, (1, 16, 18)>.
