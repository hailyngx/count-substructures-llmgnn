Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 8, 2, 11, 1, 6, 10, 14, 5, 9, 12, and 13. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
6. For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them all up gives us a total of 69 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, 1, 6, 14>
<4, 1, 10, 9>
<4, 8, 2, 5>
<4, 8, 2, 13>
<4, 8, 5, 12>
<8, 5, 7, 3>
<8, 5, 12, 14>
<2, 10, 7, 5>
<2, 5, 12, 14>
<11, 6, 1, 14>
<1, 9, 10, 4>
<1, 11, 6, 4>
<6, 12, 5, 8>
<6, 12, 5, 14>
<10, 9, 0, 7>
<13, 0, 7, 5>
