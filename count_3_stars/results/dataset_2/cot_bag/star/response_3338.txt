Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 8, 13
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 11, 3, 7
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 6, 10, 13, 3, 7
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 6, 8, 12, 4, 2, 0
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 12, 0, 7
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 5, 3, 1
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 5, 4
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 11, 13, 5
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 13, 12, 14, 2
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 11, 7, 2
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 11, 13, 14, 4, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 6, 9, 8, 13, and 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 5, 12, and 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 0 and 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from these nodes, we get \( 5 \times 4 + 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 1 = 36 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 13)>, <6, (9, 8, 13)>, <6, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 3)>, <9, (6, 11, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (11, 3, 7)>, <8, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (6, 13, 3)>, <8, (6, 13, 7)>, <8, (10, 13, 3)>, <8, (10, 13, 7)>, <13, (6, 8, 12)>, <13, (6, 8, 4)>, <13, (6, 8, 2)>, <13, (6, 12, 4)>, <13, (6, 12, 2)>, <13, (8, 12, 4)>, <13, (8, 12, 2)>, <13, (12, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 12, 7)>, <5, (6, 12, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <5, (12, 7, 0)>, <12, (11, 5, 4)>, <12, (13, 5, 4)>, <12, (13, 5, 2)>, <12, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (11, 13, 5)>, <4, (13, 12, 2)>, <7, (9, 8, 3)>, <7, (9, 8, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 5, 3)>, <2, (11, 13, 4)>, <2, (11, 13, 1)>, <2, (13, 4, 1)>
