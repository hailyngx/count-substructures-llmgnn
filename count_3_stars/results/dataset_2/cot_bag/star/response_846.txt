Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors:  
- Node 5 has neighbors 6, 8, 11, and 3.  
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 1, 14, 10, and 2.  
- Node 8 has neighbors 5, 9, 2, and 7.  
- Node 7 has neighbors 9, 6, 8, 13, and 0.  
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 12, 0, 14, and 11.  
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 8, 12, 10, and 14.  
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 4, 7.  
- Node 10 has neighbors 3, 13, 2, 7, and 12.  
- Node 12 has neighbors 13, 4, 2, and 10.  
- Node 14 has neighbors 3, 4, 2.  

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we find that:  
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.  
- Node 3 can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 8 can form 2 3-stars.  
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 4 can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 2 can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.  
- Node 10 can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 12 can form 4 3-stars.  
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star.  

Adding all these up gives us a total of 49 3-stars in the graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [49], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
