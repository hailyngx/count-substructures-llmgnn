Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 19) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (5, 14) (9, 4) (2, 17) (2, 12) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 0: <0, (12, 19, 4)>, <0, (12, 19, 7)>, <0, (12, 4, 7)>, <0, (19, 4, 7)>
  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 4: <4, (19, 3, 10)>, <4, (19, 9, 10)>, <4, (3, 9, 10)>, <4, (3, 19, 10)>, <4, (3, 9, 19)>, <4, (13, 10, 9)>, <4, (13, 10, 19)>, <4, (13, 9, 19)>, <4, (13, 3, 19)>, <4, (13, 3, 10)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 8: <8, (17, 7, 3)>, <8, (17, 7, 11)>, <8, (17, 3, 11)>, <8, (7, 3, 11)>

- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 10: <10, (13, 3, 4)>, <10, (13, 3, 19)>, <10, (13, 4, 19)>, <10, (13, 4, 9)>, <10, (13, 19, 9)>, <10, (1, 3, 16)>, <10, (1, 3, 13)>, <10, (1, 16, 13)>, <10, (1, 16, 16)>, <10, (1, 13, 16)>

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 11: <11, (13, 6, 16)>, <11, (13, 6, 8)>, <11, (13, 16, 8)>, <11, (6, 16, 8)>

- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 12: <12, (0, 13, 14)>, <12, (0, 13, 2)>, <12, (0, 14, 2)>, <12, (13, 14, 2)>

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 13: <13, (3, 6, 11)>, <13, (3, 6, 8)>, <13, (3, 11, 8)>, <13, (6, 11, 8)>, <13, (10, 1, 4)>, <13, (10, 1, 6)>, <13, (10, 4, 6)>, <13, (1, 4, 6)>, <13, (1, 4, 8)>, <13, (1, 6, 8)>

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 14: <14, (2, 12, 17)>, <14, (2, 12, 5)>, <14, (2, 17, 5)>, <14, (12, 17, 5)>

- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 16: <16, (6, 10, 11)>, <16, (6, 10, 3)>, <16, (6, 11, 3)>, <16, (10, 11, 3)>

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  Unique 3-stars for node 17: <17, (2, 8, 14)>, <17, (2, 8, 15)>, <17, (2, 14, 15)>, <17, (8, 14, 15)>

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us \[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
