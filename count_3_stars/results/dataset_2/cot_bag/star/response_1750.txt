Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (18, 8) (18, 11) (19, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 9) (0, 17) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors they have are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 1 neighbor

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 or more neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 \times 7 + 10 \times 2 = 56 \).

Putting the final count inside brackets []: [56]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 11, 13)>
<2, (6, 11, 13)>
<5, (1, 6, 15)>
<6, (1, 5, 10)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<10, (6, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 6, 14)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (1, 6, 12)>
<14, (7, 10, 11)>
<15, (5, 9, 16)>
<16, (9, 15, 17)>
<17, (14, 16, 0)>
<18, (8, 11, 18)>
<19, (7, 10, 0)>

This is the information regarding the 3-stars in the given graph.
