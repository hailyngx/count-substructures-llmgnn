Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 17) (4, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 8>, <2, 8, 14>, <3, 13, 14>, <6, 15, 17>, <7, 1, 19>, <9, 8, 2>, <12, 9, 18>, <13, 14, 6>, <15, 6, 17>, <16, 17, 6>
