Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
  0 --- 3 --- 6 --- 2
  |     |     |     |
  4 --- 7 --- 5 --- 1
  |           |     |
  8           9     
```

There are several nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors, so we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: There are 4 neighbors connected to node 0, so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
   - <0, (4, 3, 5)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1: There are 3 neighbors connected to node 1, so there is 1 3-star:
   - <1, (5, 4, 9)>

3. Node 3: There are 4 neighbors connected to node 3, so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
   - <3, (5, 4, 0)>
   - <3, (5, 6, 0)>
   - <3, (5, 4, 6)>
   - <3, (4, 6, 0)>

4. Node 4: There are 5 neighbors connected to node 4, so we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars:
   - <4, (7, 5, 8)>
   - <4, (7, 5, 1)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 0)>
   - <4, (7, 0, 3)>
   - <4, (7, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 3)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 9)>
   - <4, (5, 9, 1)>
   - <4, (1, 0, 3)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 8)>

5. Node 5: There are 7 neighbors connected to node 5, so we can form 7 choose 3 = 35 3-stars. Since this is the center node for all the 3-stars formed, we do not need to list them.

6. Node 6: There are 5 neighbors connected to node 6, so we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars:
   - <6, (9, 5, 3)>
   - <6, (9, 5, 8)>
   - <6, (9, 7, 4)>
   - <6, (9, 7, 5)>
   - <6, (9, 7, 5)>
   - <6, (5, 3, 0)>
   - <6, (5, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (3, 0, 4)>
   - <6, (2, 8, 0)>
   - <6, (8, 0, 4)>

7. Node 8: There are 4 neighbors connected to node 8, so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
   - <8, (6, 2, 0)>
   - <8, (6, 0, 4)>
   - <8, (6, 4, 0)>
   - <8, (2, 0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 33.
