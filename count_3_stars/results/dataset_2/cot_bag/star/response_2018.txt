Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 25) (3, 9) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 8) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 2) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 7) (20, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (26, 0) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 14) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 18) (27, 9) (10, 14) (10, 20) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 23) (5, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (23, 5) (23, 21) (6, 14) (6, 22) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 1) (9, 3) (9, 27) (18, 24) (18, 27) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 22) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 8) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 8) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges as described. Now let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2: <2, (8, 11, 21)>
2. Node 4: <4, (5, 11, 17)> 
3. Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 12)> 
4. Node 7: <7, (1, 17, 20)>
5. Node 8: <8, (2, 11, 21)> 
6. Node 11: <11, (4, 8, 17)>
7. Node 13: <13, (2, 19, 21)>
8. Node 14: <14, (6, 10, 17)>
9. Node 17: <17, (4, 7, 14)> 
10. Node 21: <21, (2, 8, 23)>
11. Node 22: <22, (6, 8, 28)>
12. Node 24: <24, (16, 18, 19)> 
13. Node 27: <27, (14, 25, 28)> 

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 13 * 1 = 13
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0 (None in this case)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
