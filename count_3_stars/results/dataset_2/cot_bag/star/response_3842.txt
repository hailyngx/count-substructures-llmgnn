Let's count the number of 3-stars formed starting from each node:

Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 15: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 23: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 25: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 26: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 27: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 28: [inom{1}{3}] = 0  
Node 29: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 52\)  
Therefore, there are [52] 3-stars in this graph.

<4, (26, 27, 1)>  
<5, (7, 23, 17)>  
<7, (26, 0, 25)>
