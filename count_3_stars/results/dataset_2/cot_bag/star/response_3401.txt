This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 16, 24, 12  
Node 1: 26, 17, 7  
Node 2: 10, 14, 21  
Node 3: 23, 5, 18  
Node 4: 25, 24, 23  
Node 5: 3, 13, 18, 15  
Node 6: 27, 13, 8  
Node 7: 1, 11, 21  
Node 8: 25, 22, 6  
Node 9: 15  
Node 10: 2  
Node 11: 20, 17, 7, 22  
Node 12: 0, 24, 21  
Node 13: 27, 5, 6  
Node 14: 28, 2  
Node 15: 26, 5, 18, 19, 9  
Node 16: 0, 18, 24  
Node 17: 1, 23, 22, 11  
Node 18: 3, 5, 19, 15, 16  
Node 19: 18, 15  
Node 20: 25, 29, 11  
Node 21: 29, 12, 2, 7  
Node 22: 17, 28, 11, 8  
Node 23: 3, 17, 4  
Node 24: 0, 16, 12, 4  
Node 25: 20, 8, 4  
Node 26: 1, 15, 29  
Node 27: 6, 13  
Node 28: 22, 14  
Node 29: 20, 26, 21  

Now, let's count the 3-stars by finding nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29  
Number of 3-stars for each node: 
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 18: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- Node 20: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 22: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 24: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 25: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1  

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [48].

Unique 3-stars:
