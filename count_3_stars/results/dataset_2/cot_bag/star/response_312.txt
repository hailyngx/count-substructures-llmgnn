Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 10, 13)>
- <0, (3, 10, 1)>
- <0, (1, 14, 13)>
- <0, (11, 2, 1)>
- <4, (7, 12, 8)>
- <6, (2, 13, 11)>
- <6, (2, 5, 13)>
- <6, (3, 12, 0)>
- <6, (12, 13, 14)>
- <9, (4, 14, 13)>
- <9, (11, 8, 0)>
- <12, (0, 3, 12)>
- <12, (7, 4, 8)>
- <13, (0, 2, 13)>
- <13, (2, 14, 13)>
