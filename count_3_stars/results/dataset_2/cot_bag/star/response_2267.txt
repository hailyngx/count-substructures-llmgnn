Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 26) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 16) (29, 3) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 22) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 11) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 9) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 18) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 5) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 27) (19, 2) (5, 26) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 16) (25, 12) (25, 9) (14, 3) (14, 28) (24, 28) (24, 8) (27, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (16, 22) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 17) (17, 0) (17, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 23) (6, 8) (6, 23) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 3, node 9, and node 28. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 3: There are 6 edges incident to this node, so the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- For node 9: There are 5 edges incident to this node, so the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- For node 28: There are 5 edges incident to this node, so the number of 3-stars with node 28 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up these numbers, we have a total of 40 3-stars: [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 18, 29)>
<3, (9, 18, 13)>
<3, (14, 28, 21)>
<9, (20, 12, 25)>
<9, (8, 12, 25)>
<28, (21, 1, 2)>
<28, (1, 22, 24)>
<28, (22, 16, 14)>

And the final result is: [40].
