Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 19) (21, 15) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 29) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (6, 25) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 7) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 0) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 24) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 29) (16, 20) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 18) (28, 16) (2, 27) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 10) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 0) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 18) (29, 10) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 24) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 0) (10, 9) (10, 22) (10, 29) (23, 1) (23, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 25, 27, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: 1 3-star
7: 3 3-stars
12: 6 3-stars
13: 6 3-stars
16: 5 3-stars
18: 3 3-stars
19: 3 3-stars
20: 3 3-stars
25: 3 3-stars
27: 4 3-stars
29: 5 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 39 3-stars. Hence, the answer is [39].

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (7, 9, 23)>
<7, (1, 15, 25)>
<7, (15, 21, 24)>
<7, (17, 24, 25)>
