Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: 3 neighbors  
Node 1: 4 neighbors  
Node 2: 4 neighbors  
Node 3: 4 neighbors  
Node 4: 4 neighbors  
Node 5: 4 neighbors  
Node 6: 4 neighbors  
Node 7: 3 neighbors  
Node 11: 3 neighbors  
Node 12: 3 neighbors  
Node 13: 2 neighbors  
Node 14: 3 neighbors  
Node 15: 3 neighbors  
Node 16: 3 neighbors  
Node 17: 4 neighbors  
Node 18: 3 neighbors  

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3}] = [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [34] \]

So, there are a total of 34 3-stars in the graph.
  
Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 17, 18)>
<1, (0, 13, 17)>
<2, (12, 15, 16)>
<3, (2, 14, 17)>
<4, (6, 7, 12)>
<5, (6, 9, 11)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<10, (15, 16, 18)>
<11, (1, 2, 5)>
<12, (4, 6, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 17)>
<14, (3, 4, 16)>
<15, (15, 18, 2)>
<16, (10, 14, 17)>
<17, (0, 13, 3)>
<18, (1, 10, 15)>
<19, (17, 0, 19)>

This completes the analysis of the 3-stars in the given graph.
