Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 13) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 23) (18, 20) (18, 28) (22, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (29, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 12) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 2) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 7) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 2) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 29) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 21) (21, 13) (2, 14) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 23) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 23) (20, 18) (20, 23) (8, 3) (8, 17) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 5) (19, 24) (19, 7) (19, 16) (5, 29) (5, 16) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with at least three neighbors are: 15, 27, 6, 9, 28, 17, 29, 0, 14, 26, 1, 3, 23, 13, 20, 16, and 7.

Next, we can apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we have \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 74 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [74].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <15, 10, 14>
- <27, 9, 13>
- <6, 9, 14>
- <28, 6, 18>
- <17, 1, 7>
- <29, 13, 21>
- <23, 11, 12>
- <16, 14, 2>
- <7, 19, 13>
- <16, 19, 24>
