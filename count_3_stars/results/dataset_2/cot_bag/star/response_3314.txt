Response:
First, let's organize the given edges based on the nodes they connect:

Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 24)
Node 1: (1, 15), (1, 18), (1, 19)
Node 2: (2, 12), (2, 22), (2, 25)
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 11), (3, 18)
Node 4: (4, 17), (4, 20), (4, 22)
Node 5: (5, 26)
Node 6: (6, 16)
Node 7: (7, 17)
Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 14)
Node 9: (9, 14)
Node 10: (10, 27), (10, 21), (10, 29)
Node 11: (11, 3), (11, 21), (11, 25)
Node 12: (12, 2), (12, 22), (12, 24), (12, 28)
Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 21)
Node 14: (14, 8), (14, 9), (14, 16)
Node 15: (15, 1), (15, 12), (15, 27), (15, 28), (15, 29)
Node 16: (16, 6), (16, 14), (16, 29)
Node 17: (17, 4), (17, 7), (17, 24), (17, 28)
Node 18: (18, 3), (18, 1), (18, 26), (18, 29)
Node 19: (19, 1), (19, 20), (19, 28)
Node 20: (20, 4), (20, 19), (20, 29)
Node 21: (21, 10), (21, 11), (21, 13), (21, 23)
Node 22: (22, 2), (22, 4), (22, 12), (22, 25)
Node 23: (23, 21), (23, 26)
Node 24: (24, 0), (24, 12), (24, 17), (24, 27)
Node 25: (25, 2), (25, 11), (25, 22)
Node 26: (26, 5), (26, 18), (26, 23)
Node 27: (27, 10), (27, 15), (27, 24)
Node 28: (28, 12), (28, 15), (28, 17), (28, 19)
Node 29: (29, 10), (29, 15), (29, 16), (29, 18), (29, 20)

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 15: 4 neighbors (15, 1), (15, 12), (15, 28), (15, 29)
Node 18: 4 neighbors (18, 1), (18, 26), (18, 29)
Node 21: 4 neighbors (21, 10), (21, 11), (21, 13)
Node 22: 4 neighbors (22, 2), (22, 4), (22, 12)
Node 24: 4 neighbors (24, 0), (24, 12), (24, 17) 
Node 26: 3 neighbors (26, 5), (26, 18), (26, 23)
Node 28: 4 neighbors (28, 12), (28, 15), (28, 17), (28, 19)
Node 29: 5 neighbors (29, 10), (29, 15), (29, 16), (29, 18), (29, 20)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node, total \( 4*5 = 20 \)
For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node, total 3
Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 3 = 23 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<15, (1, 12, 28)>  
<15, (1, 28, 29)>  
<15, (12, 28, 29)>  
<18, (1, 26, 29)>  
<21, (10, 11, 13)>  
<22, (2, 4, 12)>  
<24, (0, 12, 17)>  
<26, (5, 18, 23)>  
<28, (12, 15, 17)>  
<29, (10, 16, 18)>  
Our work here is complete.
