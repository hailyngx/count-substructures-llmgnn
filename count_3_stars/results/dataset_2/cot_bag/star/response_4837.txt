Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 17) (29, 11) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 5) (20, 0) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 26) (18, 15) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 21) (22, 4) (22, 26) (22, 1) (26, 2) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 3) (27, 4) (27, 13) (28, 2) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 17) (21, 19) (21, 25) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 12) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 1) (7, 23) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 21) (25, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 17) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 24) (14, 9) (14, 7) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 23) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with only two neighbors: nodes 6, 18, 10, and 4. Thus, they cannot form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 2, 9, 24, and 29 have exactly three neighbors but they have multiple triangles and no 3-star. 

Let's focus on nodes 1, 3, 5, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, and 26 since they have at least four neighbors, which is a prerequisite for forming a 3-star. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
4. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 13: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
6. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 17: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
8. Node 19: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
9. Node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
10. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
11. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 26: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes, we get: 
\[ 20 + 20 + 35 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 224 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 224, which can be represented as: \[ [224] \]

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
