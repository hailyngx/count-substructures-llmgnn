Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 2, 8, 5, 13, 9, and 6.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10] = [85] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 11, 14)>
- <3, (1, 6, 12)>
- <10, (5, 11, 14)>
- <11, (3, 10, 14)>
- <12, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (8, 13, 14)>
- <8, (0, 9, 12)>
- <5, (4, 10, 12)>
- <13, (2, 9, 14)>
- <9, (0, 8, 13)>
- <6, (3, 8, 13)>
