Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (0, 1)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6)

We'll calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [3]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
