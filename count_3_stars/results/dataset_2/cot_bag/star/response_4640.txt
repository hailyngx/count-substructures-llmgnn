Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 18) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges in the graph. Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 11, 6, 12, 1
Node 1: 0, 19
Node 2: 3, 12, 16, 4
Node 3: 15, 7, 2
Node 4: 5, 19, 2
Node 5: 11, 6, 12, 7, 4
Node 6: 15, 5, 7, 0
Node 7: 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 13, 9, 14
Node 9: 8, 14, 16
Node 10: 11
Node 11: 10, 0, 5, 17
Node 12: 5, 0, 2
Node 13: 8, 17, 18
Node 14: 8, 9
Node 15: 3, 6, 18, 16
Node 16: 15, 9, 19, 2
Node 17: 13, 11
Node 18: 15, 13
Node 19: 1, 4, 16

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [0]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [0]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [0]
Node 11: [1]
Node 12: [0]
Node 13: [0]
Node 14: [0]
Node 15: [1]
Node 16: [1]
Node 17: [0]
Node 18: [1]
Node 19: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [9]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (11, 12, 5)>
<1, (0, 19, 16)>
<2, (3, 12, 16)>
<4, (5, 19, 2)>
<5, (11, 6, 7)>
<6, (15, 5, 7)>
<11, (10, 0, 17)>
<15, (3, 6, 18)>
<16, (15, 9, 19)>
