Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can see that each node has the following number of neighbors:  
- Node 1: 3 neighbors  
- Node 2: 5 neighbors  
- Node 3: 3 neighbors  
- Node 4: 3 neighbors  
- Node 5: 4 neighbors  
- Node 6: 3 neighbors  
- Node 7: 4 neighbors  
- Node 8: 4 neighbors  
- Node 9: 7 neighbors  
- Node 0: 5 neighbors  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
- For Node 1, there is 1 3-star.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there is 1 3-star.
- For Node 4, there is 1 3-star.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there is 1 3-star.
- For Node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 

Summing up all the 3-stars gives 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 = 71.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [71].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:   
<1, (0, 2, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 8)>  
<2, (0, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (6, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 5, 9)>  
<4, (2, 8, 9)>  
<5, (0, 7, 9)>  
<7, (5, 8, 9)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
