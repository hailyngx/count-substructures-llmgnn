Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

We can see that nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [28] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (8, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
