Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (0, 27) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 18) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 1) (10, 24) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 6) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 17) (29, 19) (6, 0) (6, 28) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 19) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 15) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 21) (3, 18) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (24, 16) (24, 10) (1, 20) (1, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 21) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 9) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 28) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 11, 18, 20, and 25. 

For node 11:
- There are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center: <11, (16, 8, 26)>

For node 18:
- There are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 18 as the center: 
  <18, (22, 20, 13)>, 
  <18, (22, 20, 8)>, 
  <18, (22, 13, 8)>, 
  <18, (20, 13, 8)>, 
  <18, (22, 20, 3)>, 
  <18, (22, 13, 3)>, 
  <18, (20, 13, 3)>, 
  <18, (22, 20, 8)>, 
  <18, (22, 13, 8)>, 
  and <18, (20, 13, 8)>

For node 20:
- There are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 20 as the center: <20, (18, 14, 25)>

For node 25:
- There are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 25 as the center: <25, (20, 15, 19)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
