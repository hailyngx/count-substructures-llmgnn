Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) we find that the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 59. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 25, 14>, <0, 25, 12>, <0, 14, 15>, <2, 1, 17>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 28>, <2, 17, 7>, <2, 17, 28>, <2, 7, 28>, <2, 7, 20>, <2, 28, 15>, <4, 27, 24>, <4, 27, 28>, <4, 24, 10>, <4, 24, 6>, <4, 24, 27>, <4, 28, 18>, <6, 20, 24>, <7, 25, 11>, <7, 25, 29>, <7, 25, 2>, <7, 11, 29>, <7, 11, 12>, <9, 3, 20>, <10, 24, 6>, <10, 24, 27>, <11, 1, 7>, <13, 21, 19>, <13, 21, 15>, <13, 19, 15>, <14, 0, 15>, <15, 28, 13>, <17, 20, 2>, <18, 17, 26>, <18, 28, 26>, <20, 17, 2>, <20, 17, 6>, <20, 2, 28>, <20, 6, 24>, <22, 1, 16>, <22, 1, 5>, <22, 1, 12>
