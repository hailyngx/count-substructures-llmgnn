Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: 5, 4, 8, 6
2: 8, 6, 3
3: 5, 9, 7, 2, 0, 6
4: 5, 9, 8, 6, 1
5: 9, 4, 1, 0, 3
6: 4, 2, 1, 3
7: 9, 3
8: 9, 4, 2, 0, 1
9: 5, 9, 8, 7, 3

Calculating the 3-stars for each node:

Node 5 forms 1 3-star (5, 1, 4) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star (9, 8, 4) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star (4, 6, 1) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 7 has less than 3 neighbors so does not form any 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star (8, 2, 0) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 2 has less than 3 neighbors so does not form any 3-stars.
Node 0 has less than 3 neighbors so does not form any 3-stars.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star (1, 6, 4) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star (6, 3, 4) and may form additional 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star (3, 7, 9) and may form additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found are <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (8, 4, 6)>, <4, (6, 1, 3)>, <8, (2, 0, 1)>, and <3, (7, 9, 3)>.
