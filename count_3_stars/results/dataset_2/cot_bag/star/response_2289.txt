Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 10, 12, 14
- Node 1: 7,8,14
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9, 10, 11
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 9, 10
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 10
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9, 11
- Node 7: 1, 3, 11, 12
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 10: 0, 2, 4, 5, 10
- Node 11: 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 12: 0, 7, 11
- Node 13: 8, 10, 11
- Node 14: 0, 1, 11 

Now let's count the number of 3-stars. 
  
Node 0: [1]
<Node 0, (3, 4, 10)>
<Node 0, (4, 10, 12)>
<Node 0, (10, 12, 14)>

Node 1: [0]

Node 2: [1]
<Node 2, (4, 9, 10)>

Node 3: [0]

Node 4: [1]
<Node 4, (0, 2, 5)>
<Node 4, (0, 2, 10)>
<Node 4, (0, 5, 10)>
<Node 4, (2, 5, 10)>

Node 5: [0]

Node 6: [1]
<Node 6, (5, 9, 11)>

Node 7: [1]
<Node 7, (11, 12, 14)>

Node 8: [0]

Node 9: [0]

Node 10: [1]
<Node 10, (0, 2, 4)>
<Node 10, (0, 4, 10)>
<Node 10, (2, 4, 10)>
<Node 10, (4, 5, 10)>

Node 11: [3]
<Node 11, (6, 7, 12)>
<Node 11, (6, 7, 14)>
<Node 11, (7, 12, 14)>

Node 12: [0]

Node 13: [0]

Node 14: [0]

Total number of 3-stars: \(1+0+1+0+1+0+1+1+0+0+1+3+0 = 8\)
The final count is [8].
