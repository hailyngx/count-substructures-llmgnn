Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 17) (22, 10) (22, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 28) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 11) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 4) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 15) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 0) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 5) (12, 2) (12, 28) (12, 29) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (14, 11) (14, 20) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 21) (0, 29) (24, 25) (24, 16) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 16) (8, 11) (8, 16) (20, 19) (20, 14) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 21) (15, 18) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 28) (21, 0) (21, 29) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 22) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 23) (28, 10) (28, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 25

So, there are 25 total 3-stars in this graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [25]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 12, 28)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 13)>, 
<4, (18, 26, 15)>, 
<5, (16, 17, 27)>, 
<6, (3, 10, 26)>, 
<7, (3, 11, 22)>, 
<10, (6, 23, 28)>, 
<11, (7, 14, 17)>, 
<13, (1, 0, 26)>, 
<16, (5, 8, 24)>, 
<17, (18, 11, 5)>, 
<18, (4, 15, 17)>, 
<19, (2, 26, 20)>, 
<26, (19, 4, 13)>, 
<28, (2, 10, 12)>
