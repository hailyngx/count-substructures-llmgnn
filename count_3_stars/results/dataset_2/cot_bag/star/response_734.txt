Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9  
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7  
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 3: 2  
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8  
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9  
Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9  
Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 9  
Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 2  
Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 0  

Checking the nodes, we see that only Node 5 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors (which is 3 or more as required by the rules for forming 3-stars).
So, applying the formula:  
For Node 5, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 9, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 5)>
