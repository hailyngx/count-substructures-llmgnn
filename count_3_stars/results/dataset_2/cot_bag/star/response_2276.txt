Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star).
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star).
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star).
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
10. Node 9 has 7 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
From nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, we have \(6 \times \binom{4}{3} = 24\) possible 3-stars.
From node 9, we have \(1 \times \binom{7}{3} = 35\) possible 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \(24 + 35 = 59\).

Therefore, the final answer is [59] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
