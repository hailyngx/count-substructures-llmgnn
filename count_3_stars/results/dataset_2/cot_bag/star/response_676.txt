Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 3) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (7, 1) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 1) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph are nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
