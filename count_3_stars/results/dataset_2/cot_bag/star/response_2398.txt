Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will analyze each of them to find the 3-stars. 

For node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 8, and 6.
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 0.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 0 are <>.

For node 1:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 2, and 7.
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 1.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 1 are <>.

For node 2:
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, and 7.
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 2.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 2 are <>.

For node 3:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 4, and 2.
There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 3 are <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (1, 4, 2)>.

For node 4:
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 3, 0, and 8.
There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 4.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 4 are <4, (9, 6, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (9, 3, 0)>, <4, (9, 3, 8)>, <4, (9, 0, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 0)>, <4, (6, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 8)>, <4, (3, 0, 8)>.

For node 5:
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, and 4.
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 5 are <>.

For node 6:
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 4, 8, and 0.
There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 6.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 6 are <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>.

For node 9:
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 4, 2, and 1.
There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 9.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 9 are <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>.

For node 7:
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 1, and 2.
There is 1 3-star with node 7.
The unique 3-star formed with node 7 is <>.

For node 8:
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 0, and 4.
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 8.
The unique 3-stars formed with node 8 are <>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4] = 61.
