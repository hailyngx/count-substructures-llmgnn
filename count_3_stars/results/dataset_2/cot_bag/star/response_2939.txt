Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are six nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 17.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
Total neighbors: 4 (8, 9, 0, 5)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <4, (8, 9, 0)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <4, (8, 0, 5)>, <4, (9, 0, 5)>

For node 8:
Total neighbors: 4 (4, 10, 3, 8)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <8, (4, 10, 3)>, <8, (4, 10, 8)>, <8, (4, 3, 8)>, <8, (10, 3, 8)>

For node 9:
Total neighbors: 4 (4, 18, 14, 12)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <9, (4, 18, 14)>, <9, (4, 18, 12)>, <9, (4, 14, 12)>, <9, (18, 14, 12)>

For node 12:
Total neighbors: 5 (17, 9, 19, 3, 14)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars: <12, (17, 9, 19)>, <12, (17, 9, 3)>, <12, (17, 9, 14)>, <12, (17, 19, 3)>, <12, (17, 19, 14)>, <12, (17, 3, 14)>, <12, (9, 19, 3)>, <12, (9, 19, 14)>, <12, (9, 3, 14)>, <12, (19, 3, 14)>

For node 13:
Total neighbors: 4 (17, 19, 0, 13)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <13, (17, 19, 0)>, <13, (17, 19, 13)>, <13, (17, 0, 13)>, <13, (19, 0, 13)>

For node 17:
Total neighbors: 4 (13, 12, 2, 7)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <17, (13, 12, 2)>, <17, (13, 12, 7)>, <17, (13, 2, 7)>, <17, (12, 2, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30
So, the final count of 3-stars is [30].
