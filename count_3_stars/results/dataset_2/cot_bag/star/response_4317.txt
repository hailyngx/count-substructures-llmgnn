Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:  
Node 0: 12, 14, 17  
Node 1: 12  
Node 2: 18, 12, 19  
Node 3: 18, 13, 17, 16  
Node 4: 18, 13, 11  
Node 5: 7, 16  
Node 6: 14, 13, 8  
Node 7: 12, 10, 9, 5  
Node 8: 15, 6  
Node 9: 7, 15, 19, 16  
Node 10: 7, 14  
Node 11: 18, 4  
Node 12: 2, 7, 0, 1  
Node 13: 4, 17, 3, 6  
Node 14: 0, 19, 6, 10  
Node 15: 9, 8  
Node 16: 5, 3, 9  
Node 17: 0, 13, 3  
Node 18: 2, 4, 11, 3  
Node 19: 2, 14, 9  

Let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:  
Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (18, 12, 19)>  
Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (12, 9, 10)>  
Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (2, 0, 1)>  
Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (0, 10, 19)>  
Node 16 forms one 3-star: <16, (5, 3, 9)>  
Node 18 forms one 3-star: <18, (2, 4, 11)>  
Node 19 forms one 3-star: <19, (2, 9, 14)>  

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have 6 3-stars in total.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
