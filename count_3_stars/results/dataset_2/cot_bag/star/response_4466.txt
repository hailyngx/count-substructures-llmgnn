Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars formed in this graph:

[50]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <5, (4, 1, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 8, 5)>, <8, (7, 6, 2)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>
