Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
The central nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 9.
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each central node based on their neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 64 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
