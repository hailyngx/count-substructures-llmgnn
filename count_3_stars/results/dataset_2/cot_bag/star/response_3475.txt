Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 72. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ <0, (1, 4, 12)>, <0, (1, 4, 13)>, <0, (1, 4, 14)>, <0, (1, 12, 13)>, <0, (1, 12, 14)>, <0, (1, 13, 14)>, <0, (4, 12, 13)>, <0, (4, 12, 14)>, <0, (4, 13, 14)>, <0, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (5, 12, 14)>, <2, (11, 12, 14)>, <2, (2, 3, 12)>, <2, (2, 3, 14)>, <2, (2, 11, 14)>, <2, (3, 11, 14)>, <3, (2, 8, 11)>, <3, (8, 11, 13)>, <3, (2, 8, 13)>, <3, (2, 11, 13)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)> \]
