Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68.

So, the final answer would be [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (8, 1, 0)>
<0, (9, 3, 6)>
