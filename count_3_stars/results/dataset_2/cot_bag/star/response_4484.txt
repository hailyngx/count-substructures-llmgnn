Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has neighbors: [6, 8, 9]
- Node 1 has neighbors: [2, 3, 9]
- Node 2 has neighbors: [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
- Node 3 has neighbors: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
- Node 4 has neighbors: [2, 3, 6, 8]
- Node 5 has neighbors: [2, 3, 7]
- Node 6 has neighbors: [0, 4, 7, 8]
- Node 7 has neighbors: [3, 5, 6]
- Node 8 has neighbors: [0, 4, 6, 9]
- Node 9 has neighbors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 6 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
