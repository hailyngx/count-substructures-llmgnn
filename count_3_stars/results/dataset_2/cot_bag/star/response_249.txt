Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 27) (0, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 13) (20, 22) (17, 27) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 4) (18, 17) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 16) (8, 5) (1, 24) (15, 26) (15, 21) (15, 28) (19, 18) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 22) (10, 14) (3, 24) (3, 22) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 7) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 13) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 24) (23, 5) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 19) (2, 16) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 12) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 23) (16, 26) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (22, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 5, 9, 27, 17, 29, 18, 26, 18, 25, 10, 24, 7, 23, 4, and 14.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from the above calculations: 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 27, 8)>, <27, (9, 29, 17)>, <17, (27, 29, 18)>, <29, (27, 17, 7)>, <18, (27, 26, 19)>, <26, (18, 15, 11)>, <25, (18, 4, 28)>, <10, (5, 0, 12)>, <24, (1, 3, 11)>, <7, (29, 28, 24)>, <23, (5, 4, 21)>, <4, (29, 25, 23)>, <14, (25, 10, 23)>.
