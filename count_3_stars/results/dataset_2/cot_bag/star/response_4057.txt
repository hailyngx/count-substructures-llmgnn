Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 4) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (14, 15, 17)>
- <1, (17, 7, 8)>
- <4, (17, 16, 2)>
- <8, (17, 10, 1)>
- <10, (6, 11, 0)>
- <15, (9, 14, 18)>
- <17, (1, 8, 0)>
