Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes, we get \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 14)>, <0, (2, 10, 13)>, <0, (3, 10, 13)>, <0, (3, 8, 14)>, <1, (2, 12, 5)>, <1, (5, 8, 14)>, <2, (0, 10, 14)>, <4, (6, 9, 11)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 11, 13)>, <8, (0, 10, 14)>, <10, (0, 13, 14)>, <11, (4, 7, 10)>, <14, (8, 10, 5)>.
