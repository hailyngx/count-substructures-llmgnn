Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 18) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 18) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Based on the given edges, the graph is as follows:

0 ---- 16
1 ---- 7, 9, 11
2 ---- 8, 12, 13, 17
3 ---- 5, 17
5 ---- 11, 17
6 ---- 13, 17
7 ---- 1, 9
8 ---- 2, 10, 15, 18
9 ---- 1, 7, 15
10 ---- 8, 14, 16, 18
11 ---- 5, 12
12 ---- 2, 11, 18, 19
13 ---- 0, 2, 6, 18
14 ---- 10, 19
15 ---- 8, 9, 16
16 ---- 0, 10, 15
17 ---- 2, 3, 5, 6
18 ---- 8, 10, 12, 13, 19
19 ---- 12, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 2: C(4,3) = 4
For node 5: C(2,3) = 0
For node 6: C(2,3) = 0
For node 8: C(4,3) = 4
For node 9: C(2,3) = 0
For node 10: C(4,3) = 4
For node 11: C(2,3) = 0
For node 12: C(4,3) = 4
For node 13: C(2,3) = 0
For node 15: C(3,3) = 1
For node 16: C(2,3) = 0
For node 17: C(4,3) = 4
For node 18: C(5,3) = 10
For node 19: C(2,3) = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (8, 12, 18)>
<8, (2, 12, 18)>
<10, (8, 14, 18)>
<12, (2, 11, 18)>
<18, (8, 10, 12)>
