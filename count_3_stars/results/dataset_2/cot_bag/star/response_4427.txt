Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {8, 14, 19}
- Node 2: {3, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {16, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 12}
- Node 7: {3, 12, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10, 15}
- Node 10: {9, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 13: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 17}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 5, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {10, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 12, 13}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

- Node 1 forms 1 three-star: <1, (8, 11, 19)>
- Node 2 forms 1 three-star: <2, (3, 16, 17)>
- Node 3 forms 1 three-star: <3, (2, 7, 16)>
- Node 9 forms 1 three-star: <9, (4, 6, 15)>
- Node 10 forms 1 three-star: <10, (13, 15, 18)>
- Node 11 forms 7 three-stars: 
  - <11, (4, 8, 14)>
  - <11, (4, 8, 17)>
  - <11, (4, 14, 17)>
  - <11, (8, 14, 17)>
  - <11, (4, 14, 15)>
  - <11, (4, 17, 15)>
  - <11, (14, 15, 17)>  
- Node 12 forms 3 three-stars:
  - <12, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <12, (6, 9, 18)>
  - <12, (9, 18, 19)>  
- Node 13 forms 1 three-star: <13, (10, 15, 19)>
- Node 14 forms 2 three-stars:
  - <14, (11, 15, 17)>
  - <14, (11, 15, 17)>
- Node 15 forms 4 three-stars:
  - <15, (9, 10, 13)>
  - <15, (9, 10, 14)>
  - <15, (10, 13, 19)>
  - <15, (13, 14, 19)>
- Node 16 forms 1 three-star: <16, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 17 forms 5 three-stars:
  - <17, (5, 11, 14)>
  - <17, (11, 14, 15)>
  - <17, (11, 14, 15)>
  - <17, (14, 15, 17)>
  - <17, (14, 15, 17)>
- Node 18 forms 1 three-star: <18, (10, 12, 19)>
- Node 19 forms 1 three-star: <19, (1, 13, 12)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph.
