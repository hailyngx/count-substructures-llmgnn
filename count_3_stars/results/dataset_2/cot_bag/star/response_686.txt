The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 25) (22, 23) (22, 16) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 28) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 4) (29, 24) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 28) (26, 13) (26, 18) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 25) (18, 26) (18, 8) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 27) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 0) (4, 29) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 25) (2, 12) (2, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 20) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 4) (15, 14) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 29) (25, 21) (25, 5) (25, 0) (27, 17) (27, 16) (20, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars, where n is the number of neighbors for that node.
- Summing all the results, we get the total number of 3-stars.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [48].
