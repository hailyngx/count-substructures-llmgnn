Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 14) (25, 7) (25, 18) (28, 10) (28, 2) (29, 13) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 10) (22, 24) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 7) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (24, 22) (24, 26) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 23) (27, 22) (27, 19) (17, 8) (17, 26) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 14) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 6) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 21) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 25) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 6) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 4) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 11, 8, 23  
Node 1: 11, 17, 18  
Node 2: 28, 4, 7  
Node 3: 20, 7, 19, 18  
Node 4: 6, 2  
Node 5: 16  
Node 6: 4, 23, 18, 19  
Node 7: 25, 26, 3, 2  
Node 8: 11, 9, 13, 17, 0  
Node 9: 8, 13, 19  
Node 10: 28, 22, 18  
Node 11: 0, 1, 8, 16  
Node 12: 23  
Node 13: 9, 8, 15, 29  
Node 14: 16, 20, 21  
Node 15: 13  
Node 16: 11, 22, 14, 5  
Node 17: 1, 8, 26  
Node 18: 25, 3, 19, 6, 1, 10  
Node 19: 9, 3, 27, 6, 18  
Node 20: 21, 3, 14  
Node 21: 20, 26, 14  
Node 22: 16, 27, 10, 24  
Node 23: 12, 0, 6  
Node 24: 22, 26  
Node 25: 7, 18  
Node 26: 25, 21, 17, 7, 24  
Node 27: 22, 19  
Node 28: 10, 2  

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:  
Node 11: [1]  
Node 16: [1]  
Node 8: [1]  
Node 13: [1]  
Node 3: [1]  
Node 7: [1]  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<11, (1, 8, 0)>  
<16, (22, 14, 5)>  
<8, (11, 13, 17)>  
<13, (9, 15, 29)>  
<3, (20, 7, 19)>  
<7, (25, 26, 2)>
