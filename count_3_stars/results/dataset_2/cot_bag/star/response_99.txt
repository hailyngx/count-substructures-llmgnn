Response:
This graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 14, 22, 26, 29)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 16, 20)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 12, 15, 24, 26, 28)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 4, 7, 19)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 16, 19, 24)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 15, 16, 18, 26)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 2, 8, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 0, 13, 25)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 6, 11, 18, 21)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 1, 10, 11, 28)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 11, 15, 17, 24)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 9, 10, 24)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 15, 20, 25)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 6, 10, 18, 19, 5)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 14, 21, 23)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 14, 29)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (15, 26, 28)>
<9, (4, 7, 19)>
<10, (16, 19, 24)>
<11, (15, 18, 26)>
<13, (2, 8, 14)>
<14, (0, 13, 25)>
<15, (6, 18, 21)>
<16, (10, 11, 28)>
<18, (15, 17, 24)>
<24, (10, 18, 19)>
<25, (14, 21, 23)>
