Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (3, 13) (3, 0) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 15) (7, 17) (4, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 29 \) 3-stars in total.

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<10, (1, 15, 19)>
<11, (8, 2, 18)>

<14, (17, 6, 19)>
<15, (9, 14, 10)>
<17, (14, 6, 12)>
<19, (14, 13, 10)>
<17, (2, 7, 6)>
<17, (2, 6, 12)>
<17, (7, 2, 14)>
