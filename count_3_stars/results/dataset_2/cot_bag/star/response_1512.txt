Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 14) (10, 2) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's summarize the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 1 neighbor
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (7, 4, 11)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 4, 11)>
<4, (1, 7, 16)>
<4, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 15)>
<4, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 16)>
<4, (7, 1, 2)>

<6, (5, 17, 4)>
<6, (5, 17, 11)>

<6, (13, 17, 11)>
