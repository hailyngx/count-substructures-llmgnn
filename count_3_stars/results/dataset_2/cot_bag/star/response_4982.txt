Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 2
- Node 1: 5, 7, 6, 3
- Node 2: 5, 9, 4, 7, 0
- Node 3: 4, 7, 1
- Node 4: 7, 2, 6, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1
- Node 7: 4, 3, 6, 2, 1
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 5, 6, 2, 0

There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5.

For each of these nodes, we can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 10 + 20] = 35.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 6, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 0)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 3, 1)>
<5, (2, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 2)>
<5, (9, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (5, 7, 6)>
