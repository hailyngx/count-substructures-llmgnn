Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 22) (7, 17) (21, 28) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 28) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 20) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 17) (8, 29) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 15) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 29) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 14) (5, 18) (5, 29) (13, 16) (13, 20) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 24) (25, 2) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 25) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 10) (2, 25) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 16) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 15) (23, 1) (23, 15) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 12) (24, 20) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 13) (20, 24) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars. 

1. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9), (9, 4), (9, 27)
    - 1 3-star formed: <9, (6, 4, 27)>

2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3), (3, 19), (3, 26), (3, 22)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <3, (1, 19, 26)>, <3, (1, 19, 22)>, <3, (1, 26, 22)>, <3, (19, 26, 22)>

3. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: (9, 27), (25, 27), (27, 10)
    - 1 3-star formed: <27, (9, 25, 10)>

4. Node 28 has 4 neighbors: (21, 28), (10, 28), (28, 4), (14, 28)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <28, (21, 10, 4)>, <28, (21, 10, 14)>, <28, (21, 4, 14)>, <28, (10, 4, 14)>

5. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: (3, 26), (10, 26), (19, 26), (26, 29)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <26, (3, 10, 19)>, <26, (3, 10, 29)>, <26, (3, 19, 29)>, <26, (10, 19, 29)>

6. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (13, 16), (16, 18), (16, 0)
    - 1 3-star formed: <16, (13, 18, 0)>

7. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (28, 14), (25, 14), (14, 15)
    - 1 3-star formed: <14, (28, 25, 15)>

8. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (5, 18), (19, 18), (16, 18)
    - 1 3-star formed: <18, (5, 19, 16)>

9. Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (25, 24), (12, 24), (22, 24), (20, 24)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <24, (25, 12, 22)>, <24, (25, 12, 20)>, <24, (25, 22, 20)>, <24, (12, 22, 20)>

10. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: (3, 22), (2, 22), (22, 24), (17, 22)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <22, (3, 2, 24)>, <22, (3, 2, 17)>, <22, (3, 24, 17)>, <22, (2, 24, 17)>

11. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (7, 17), (4, 17), (0, 17), (22, 17)
    - 4 3-stars formed: <17, (7, 4, 0)>, <17, (7, 4, 22)>, <17, (7, 0, 22)>, <17, (4, 0, 22)>

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes, we get a total of [26].
