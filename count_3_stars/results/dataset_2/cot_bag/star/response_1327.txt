Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- 1: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- 3: {2, 4, 5}
- 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- 5: {3, 6, 9}
- 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- 7: {1, 8}
- 8: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- 9: {4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we check for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9} -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9} -> 1 3-star
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9} -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4  

So, the final result is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 2, 3)> <4, (2, 4, 8)> <6, (0, 1, 2)> <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
