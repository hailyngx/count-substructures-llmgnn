Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```plaintext
         1 --- 0 --- 2
        /|\   /|\   |    
       11 14 12  8  10  
        |     |  |  /
         5 --- 4 --- 6
         |     |     |
         3 --- 7 --- 9
```

The nodes with three or more edges are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 12. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 1, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 0, 10, 11, and 14. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, we have exactly 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9, and 13. So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 10, and 11. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 9, and 13. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, and 12. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, and 7. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 6, 12, 13, and 14. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 10, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 11, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, and 12. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 12, we have exactly 5 neighbors: 0, 7, 9, 11, and 13. So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 13, we have exactly 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, and 12. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from each node with three or more neighbors, 
we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 12)>
<1, (0, 10, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 12, 13)>
<10, (1, 2, 3)>
<11, (1, 4, 5)>
<12, (0, 7, 9)>
<13, (2, 3, 6)>
