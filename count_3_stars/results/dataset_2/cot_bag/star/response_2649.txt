Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges as described. 

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [41].
