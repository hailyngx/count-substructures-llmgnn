Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 25) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 15) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 25) (9, 14) (9, 5) (9, 24) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 27) (11, 12) (3, 14) (8, 17) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 15) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 26) (27, 13) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 6) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 6) (18, 0) (19, 8) (19, 27) (19, 26) (26, 23) (26, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 24) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 25) (7, 20) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 7) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 4) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 7) (29, 22) (29, 16) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing all these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, 21, 2>, 
<1, 21, 15>, 
<1, 5, 25>, 
<2, 21, 0>, 
<5, 21, 0>, 
<9, 14, 5>, 
<14, 22, 25>, 
<14, 17, 6>, 
<17, 14, 3>, 
<17, 14, 9>, 
<21, 1, 5>, 
<21, 1, 2>, 
<21, 2, 0>, 
<21, 15, 0>, 
<22, 14, 17>, 
<22, 14, 25>, 
<23, 8, 19>, 
<23, 8, 26>, 
<23, 8, 15>, 
<24, 13, 27>, 
<24, 9, 5>, 
<24, 12, 26>, 
<24, 12, 0>, 
<27, 13, 11>, 
<27, 13, 19>, 
<27, 11, 6>, 
<27, 19, 26>, 
<28, 10, 4>, 
<28, 10, 24>.
