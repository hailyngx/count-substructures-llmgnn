Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 19) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 19) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 3, 8, 1, 16, 6, 18, 17, 12, 0, and 7. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <5, (9, 6, 19)> <5, (9, 18, 6)> <5, (9, 18, 19)> <5, (6, 19, 18)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <9, (5, 8, 3)> <9, (5, 8, 15)> <9, (5, 3, 15)> <9, (8, 15, 3)> <9, (5, 2, 3)> <9, (8, 15, 2)> <9, (8, 2, 3)> <9, (2, 15, 3)> <9, (5, 15, 3)> <9, (8, 2, 15)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (1, 16, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (9, 18, 0)> <8, (18, 4, 0)> <8, (18, 12, 0)> <8, (4, 2, 0)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <1, (13, 17, 3)>

- Node 16:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <16, (11, 3, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 18:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <18, (5, 19, 4)> <18, (5, 8, 4)> <18, (5, 19, 8)> <18, (19, 8, 4)>

- Node 17:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <17, (11, 10, 7)>

- Node 12:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <12, (15, 0, 8)>

- Node 0:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <0, (10, 12, 8)>

- Node 7:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <7, (16, 17, 15)> <7, (14, 19, 16)> <7, (14, 15, 16)> <7, (14, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31 \).

So, the answer is [31].
