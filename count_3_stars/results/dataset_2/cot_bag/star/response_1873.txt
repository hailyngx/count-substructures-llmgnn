Based on the given information, we have a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's find the 3-star graphs in this configuration.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 20 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors.
