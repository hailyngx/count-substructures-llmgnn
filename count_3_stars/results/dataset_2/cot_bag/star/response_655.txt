Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) 
(7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) 
(1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) 
(3, 14) (3, 12) 
(10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) 
(11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) 
(8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) 
(13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) 
(6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) 
(9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) 
(2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
(5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) 
(12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) 
(14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) 
(0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5)
```

Next, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars = [inom{15}{3}]

Therefore, the final answer is the total number of 3-stars formed from this graph inside the brackets [].
