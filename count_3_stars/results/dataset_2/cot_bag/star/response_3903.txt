Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 24) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 25) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 28) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (18, 15) (22, 4) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 21) (29, 9) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 24) (20, 17) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 28) (10, 19) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 2) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 11) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (11, 7) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 23) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 12) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 14) (2, 26) (2, 16) (8, 14) (8, 9) (12, 23) (12, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 20) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are 47 nodes with one or more neighbors. Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (3, 13, 4)>
  - <1, (3, 13, 28)>
  - <1, (3, 13, 15)>
  - <1, (3, 13, 28)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (22, 1, 13)>
  - <4, (22, 1, 25)>
  - <4, (22, 13, 1)>
  - <4, (22, 13, 25)>
  - <4, (22, 1, 25)>
  - <4, (13, 1, 15)>
  - <4, (13, 1, 28)>
  - <4, (13, 1, 15)>
  - <4, (13, 1, 28)>
  - <4, (13, 15, 28)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (25, 11, 7)>
  - <7, (25, 28, 7)>
  - <7, (25, 11, 7)>
  - <7, (25, 28, 7)>
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (15, 1, 3)>
  - <13, (15, 1, 28)>
  - <13, (15, 3, 1)>
  - <13, (15, 3, 28)>
  - <13, (15, 1, 28)>
  - <13, (4, 1, 22)>
  - <13, (4, 1, 25)>
  - <13, (4, 22, 25)>
  - <13, (4, 1, 25)>
  - <13, (4, 22, 25)>
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <15, (3, 13, 1)>
  - <15, (3, 13, 4)>
  - <15, (3, 13, 28)>
  - <15, (3, 13, 4)>
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <19, (10, 0, 12)>
  - <19, (10, 0, 24)>
  - <19, (10, 12, 0)>
  - <19, (10, 0, 24)>
  - <19, (10, 12, 0)>
  - <19, (12, 0, 23)>
  - <19, (12, 0, 24)>
  - <19, (12, 23, 0)>
  - <19, (12, 0, 24)>
  - <19, (12, 23, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars from these nodes gives us a total of 42 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [42].
