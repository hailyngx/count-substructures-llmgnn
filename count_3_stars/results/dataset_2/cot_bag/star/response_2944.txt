Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50 \)

So, there are a total of 50 3-stars in the given graph. Listing them out, we have:
\[ 
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, \\
<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, \\
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 2)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>, \\
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, \\
<5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, \\
<6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, \\
<7, (4, 6, 9)>, \\
<9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, \\
<9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 0)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([50]\).
