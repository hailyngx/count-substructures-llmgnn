Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has degree 3, forming a 3-star with leaves 5, 8, and 13. <0, (5, 8, 13)>
Node 1 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 8, 9, and 11. <1, (8, 9, 11)>
Node 3 has degree 5, forming 5 3-stars: 
  <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 10)>, <3, (1, 6, 12)>, <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <3, (4, 10, 12)>
Node 5 has degree 5, forming 5 3-stars:
  <5, (0, 10, 12)>, <5, (10, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 11, 14)>, <5, (0, 12, 14)>, <5, (11, 12, 14)>
Node 8 has degree 5, forming 5 3-stars:
  <8, (0, 1, 14)>, <8, (0, 7, 14)>, <8, (1, 7, 14)>, <8, (7, 12, 14)>, <8, (1, 7, 12)>
Node 9 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 11. <9, (1, 2, 11)>
Node 10 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 7. <10, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 11 has degree 5, forming 5 3-stars:
  <11, (2, 5, 13)>, <11, (5, 6, 13)>, <11, (2, 6, 9)>, <11, (6, 9, 13)>, <11, (6, 9, 11)>
Node 12 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, and 8. <12, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 13 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 0, 11, and 10. <13, (0, 10, 11)>
Node 14 has degree 4, forming a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 8. <14, (1, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1] = [27].
