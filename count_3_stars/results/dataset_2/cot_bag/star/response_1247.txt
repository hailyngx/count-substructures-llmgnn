Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40 \) 3-stars in this graph.
