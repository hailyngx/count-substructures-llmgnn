Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 27) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 10) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (12, 2) (12, 10) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 8) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 18) (14, 1) (14, 0) (19, 26) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 7) (4, 27) (4, 15) (15, 4) (15, 13) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 21) (24, 16) (24, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 27) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 29) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 21) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 18) (29, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 21) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 1, 27, 0, 20, 14, 26, 28, 7, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 26\)

Therefore, there are 26 3-stars [] in the graph.
