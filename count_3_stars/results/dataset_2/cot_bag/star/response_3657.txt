Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 4. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
7. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 90\)

Therefore, there are 90 3-stars in total for this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, 4, 11>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<1, 0, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 12>
<3, 11, 5>
<3, 11, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 11>
<5, 12, 7>
<5, 13, 2>
<7, 3, 11>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 4, 11>
<11, 1, 4>
<11, 3, 7>
<12, 5, 14>
<13, 2, 10>
