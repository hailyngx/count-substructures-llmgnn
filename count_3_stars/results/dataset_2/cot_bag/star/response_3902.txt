Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are given below:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 11, 12
Node 1: 0, 6, 14
Node 2: 11, 14
Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 11, 12
Node 4: 9, 10
Node 5: 7, 8, 13, 14
Node 6: 1, 9, 13
Node 7: 3, 5, 10, 12
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 13
Node 9: 4, 6, 10, 14
Node 10: 4, 7, 9, 11
Node 11: 0, 2, 3, 10, 13
Node 12: 0, 3, 7, 13
Node 13: 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14
Node 14: 1, 5, 9, 13, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

Looking at the node degrees:
- Node 13 has degree 6
- Node 14 has degree 5
- Nodes 5, 9, 3, 8, and 7 have degree 4

For the nodes with degree 4 or more, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 3-stars

So, the final number of 3-stars is [50].

Some unique 3-stars are:
<5, (7, 8, 13)>
<9, (4, 6, 13)>
<3, (0, 8, 12)>
<8, (0, 5, 13)>
<7, (3, 5, 12)>
