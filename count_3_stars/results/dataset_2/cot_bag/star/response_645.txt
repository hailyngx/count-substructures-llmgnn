Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) (1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 3, 18.  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 19, 11.  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 0, 17.  
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 17, 16.  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 12, 3, 13.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 11, 7.  
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 8, 6, 19.  
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 9, 12, 2, 18.  
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 13, 11, 15.  
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 7, 12, 18.  
Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 4, 18.  
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 15, 4.  
Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 0, 13, 1, 11, 16.  
Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 2, 10.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 16: 2 neighbors, no 3-stars  
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
