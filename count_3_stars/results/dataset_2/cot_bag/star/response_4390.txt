Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 5, 9, 6, 4, 8, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 8, 1, 4).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 14, 10, 1).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 14, 10)>, <9, (5, 14, 1)>, <9, (5, 10, 1)>, <9, (6, 14, 10)>, <9, (6, 14, 1)>, <9, (6, 10, 1)>, <9, (14, 10, 1)>

Node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 1, 3, 4).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 10, 0).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 10)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 10, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 10)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (6, 10, 0)>, <4, (8, 10, 0)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (5, 4, 11, 0, 3).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 4, 11)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 3)>, <8, (5, 11, 0)>, <8, (5, 11, 3)>, <8, (5, 0, 3)>, <8, (4, 11, 0)>, <8, (4, 11, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <8, (11, 0, 3)>

Node 10:
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors (9, 4, 2, 12, 14, 0).
- Number of 3-stars involving node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (9, 4, 2)>, <10, (9, 4, 12)>, <10, (9, 4, 14)>, <10, (9, 4, 0)>, <10, (9, 2, 12)>, <10, (9, 2, 14)>, <10, (9, 2, 0)>, <10, (9, 12, 14)>, <10, (9, 12, 0)>, <10, (9, 14, 0)>, <10, (4, 2, 12)>, <10, (4, 2, 14)>, <10, (4, 2, 0)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 0)>, <10, (4, 14, 0)>, <10, (2, 12, 14)>, <10, (2, 12, 0)>, <10, (2, 14, 0)>, <10, (12, 14, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
