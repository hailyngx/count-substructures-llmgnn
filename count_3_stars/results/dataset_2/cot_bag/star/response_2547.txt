Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
    4 -- 1     0
    |    |    /|\
    |    |   / | 9
    7 -- 3  /  2
     \   | /  /
       \ |/  /
         8--5
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (7, 8, 5, 9), so it can form \(^4C_3 = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (7, 3, 5, 9), so it can form \(^4C_3 = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 6, 9, 2, 5), so it can form \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (7, 3, 8, 2, 0), so it can form \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 8 neighbors (4, 0, 6, 2, 8, 5, 1, 9), so it can form \(^8C_3 = 56\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 0, 2), so it can form \(^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (7, 9, 5, 0), so it can form \(^4C_3 = 4\) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 56 + 10 + 4 = 98\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is \[98\]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
