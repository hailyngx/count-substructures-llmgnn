Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 16) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) (16, 18) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 18) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [31] \]

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (11, 7, 14)>, 
<1, (18, 9, 7)>, 
<2, (8, 18, 9)>, 
<4, (11, 3, 17)>, 
<6, (11, 7, 15)>, 
<8, (2, 0, 6)>, 
<9, (18, 1, 16)>, 
<10, (11, 13, 19)>, 
<13, (10, 19, 15)>, 
<17, (11, 4, 5)>, 
<18, (2, 16, 12)>, 
<19, (10, 14, 5)>.
