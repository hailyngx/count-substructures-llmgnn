Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first check each node to see if it has three or more neighbors.

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8} => 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8} => 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} => 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8} => 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9} => 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4} => 1 3-star
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9} => 1 3-star
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 9} => 1 3-star
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4} => 1 3-star
Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7} => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20] = [48]

List of unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
