Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Adding these up: \( 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1= 16 \)

So, there are a total of 16 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 12)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<5, (8, 2, 13)>
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<7, (3, 0, 12)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<10, (6, 3, 5)>
<12, (1, 7, 2)>
<14, (8, 7, 4)>
