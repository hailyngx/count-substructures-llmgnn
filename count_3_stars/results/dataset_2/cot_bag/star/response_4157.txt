Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 12) (10, 19) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 16) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 18) (2, 14) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (15, 16) (15, 0) (17, 8) (17, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 19}
- Node 10: {12, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 16}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {5, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 15: {0, 16}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 11, 13, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 8}
- Node 18: {4, 12, 0}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 9, 10}

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- From Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- From Node 1: [no 3-stars]
- From Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- From Node 4: [no 3-stars]
- From Node 5: [no 3-stars]
- From Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- From Node 9: [no 3-stars]
- From Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- From Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- From Node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- From Node 18: [no 3-stars]
- From Node 19: [no 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 15)>, <0, (1, 3, 17)>, <0, (1, 6, 17)>, <0, (1, 6, 18)>, <0, (3, 6, 14)>, <0, (3, 6, 15)>, <0, (6, 14, 15)>, <3, (0, 1, 16)>, <3, (0, 14, 15)>, <3, (1, 14, 8)>, <14, (3, 6, 8)>, <16, (5, 13, 15)>, <16, (11, 5, 13)>, <16, (11, 5, 15)>, <16, (11, 5, 15)>, <16, (11, 13, 15)>, <16, (5, 7, 15)>, <16, (5, 7, 15)>, <16, (5, 13, 7)>, <16, (5, 13, 15)>
