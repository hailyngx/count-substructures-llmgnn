Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges:

First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (22, 4, 7, 5)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (26, 16)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (24, 10)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (11, 19, 18)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (9, 0)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 15, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (7, 27, 28, 11, 16)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (24, 15, 5)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (13, 4, 7, 25)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (2, 23, 25)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (22, 17, 6, 3)
- Node 12: 1 neighbor (27)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (22, 26, 21, 9)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (17, 16)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (19, 8, 5)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (14, 6, 1)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (14, 28, 11)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (21, 3)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (15, 3, 25)
- Node 20: 1 neighbor (26)
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (13, 28, 18)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (13, 11, 0, 29)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (10, 29)
- Node 24: 4 neighbors (27, 26, 8, 2)
- Node 25: 4 neighbors (10, 19, 9, 23)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (13, 1, 24, 20)
- Node 27: 4 neighbors (12, 6, 29, 24)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (17, 6, 21)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (22, 27, 23)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 26: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 27: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 29: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (22, 7, 5)>
<6, (27, 28, 16)>
<9, (13, 4, 7)>
<11, (17, 6, 3)>
<13, (22, 26, 21)>
<24, (27, 26, 8)>
<25, (10, 19, 9)>
<26, (13, 24, 20)>
<27, (6, 29, 24)>
<29, (22, 27, 23)>
