Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 13) (3, 7) (3, 27) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 22) (7, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 18) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 24) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 1) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 28) (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 26) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 17) (17, 1) (18, 3) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 24) (19, 25) (19, 18) (11, 18) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 10) (29, 5) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 12) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 22) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 0) (4, 23) (4, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 27) (22, 28) (26, 6) (26, 29) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 18) (10, 2) (10, 27) (16, 2) (16, 4) (14, 25) (14, 2) (14, 29) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
  <0, (8, 15, 28)>, <0, (8, 12, 28)>, <0, (15, 22, 28)>
  
- For node 1, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
  <1, (6, 23, 25)>, <1, (6, 17, 25)>, <1, (6, 23, 17)>
  
- For node 3, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <3, (7, 18, 27)>
   
- For node 6, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <6, (1, 20, 29)>
  
- For node 8, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <8, (0, 21, 23)>
  
- For node 9, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
  <9, (5, 15, 24)>, <9, (13, 15, 24)>, <9, (13, 15, 24)>
  
- For node 12, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <12, (0, 20, 21)>
  
- For node 13, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <13, (9, 28, 15)>
  
- For node 14, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <14, (1, 25, 29)>
  
- For node 15, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <15, (9, 22, 0)>
  
- For node 18, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
  <18, (3, 21, 24)>, <18, (19, 21, 24)>, <18, (19, 21, 24)>
  
- For node 20, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <20, (6, 22, 25)>
  
- For node 21, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <21, (8, 18, 6)>
  
- For node 22, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <22, (15, 20, 28)>
  
- For node 23, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <23, (8, 1, 4)>
  
- For node 24, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <24, (9, 18, 25)>
  
- For node 25, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <25, (24, 19, 1)>
  
- For node 27, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <27, (3, 10, 22)>
  
- For node 28, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <28, (9, 22, 0)>
  
- For node 29, there is 1 possible 3-star: 
  <29, (6, 14, 26)>
  
Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of [24].
