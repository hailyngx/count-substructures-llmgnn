Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (10, 5) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 0) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 17) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (19, 4) (19, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 19) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 and node 4.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
There are 4 neighbors of node 3: 7, 17, 14, 16.
Thus, the number of 3-stars centered at node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 4:
There are 3 neighbors of node 4: 15, 12, 19.
Thus, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (7, 14, 17)>
<3, (7, 13, 14)>
<3, (13, 14, 17)>
<3, (13, 16, 17)>
<4, (12, 15, 19)>
