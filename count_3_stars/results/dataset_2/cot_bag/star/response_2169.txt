Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 6) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (13 nodes in total).

Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (8, 5, 14)>, <0, (8, 5, 3)>, <0, (8, 14, 3)>, <0, (5, 14, 3)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (6, 9, 12)>, <2, (6, 9, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <2, (6, 12, 5)>, <2, (6, 12, 8)>, <2, (6, 5, 8)>, <2, (9, 12, 8)>, <2, (9, 12, 5)>, <2, (9, 5, 8)>, <2, (12, 5, 8)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
