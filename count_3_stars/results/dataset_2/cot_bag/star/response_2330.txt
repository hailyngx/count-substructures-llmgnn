Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 2) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 4) (8, 12) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 10) (4, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these all up, there are \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 13, 18)>
<2, (16, 17, 19)>
<5, (1, 13, 18)>
<8,(3, 12, 15)>
<9, (3, 10, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 18)> 
<14, (5, 9, 17)>
<15, (4, 7, 8)>
<16, (2, 19, 6)>
<17, (1, 2, 9)>
<19, (1, 6, 8)>
