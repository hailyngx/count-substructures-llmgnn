Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {6, 5, 3}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 4, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 4, 2, 1, 0, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5, \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 35 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (6, 5, 3)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (8, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (8, 5, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>.
