Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (9, 10, 11)>
- <1, (5, 7, 3)>
- <4, (7, 12, 6)>
- <7, (4, 12, 11)>
- <9, (5, 14, 13)>
- <12, (4, 7, 8)>
- <13, (1, 9, 6)>
- <14, (9, 12, 8)>
