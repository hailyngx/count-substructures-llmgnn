Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 6, 1, 9, 4, 2, 0, 8, and 3. Let's compute the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47], and the unique 3-stars are given by:
