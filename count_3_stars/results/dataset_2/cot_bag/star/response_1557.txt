Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 57 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 0, 1>
<2, 0, 13>
<2, 19, 5>
<2, 17, 3>
<5, 19, 6>
<7, 0, 1>
<8, 9, 2>
<10, 8, 17>
<10, 8, 9>
<10, 15, 12>
<14, 10, 19>
<16, 0, 6>
<16, 14, 10>
<17, 3, 19>
