Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (17, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 7) (8, 15) (12, 9) (12, 19) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding these up, we get a total of 39 3-stars.  
So, the final total number of 3-stars is [39].  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<4, (7, 16, 19)>  
<7, (4, 2, 8)>  
<9, (4, 12, 18)>  
<10, (1, 11, 17)>  
<12, (9, 19, 4)>  
<13, (18, 0, 16)>  
<15, (7, 2, 8)>  
<16, (4, 1, 19)>  
<18, (9, 10, 19)>  
<19, (4, 12, 18)>
