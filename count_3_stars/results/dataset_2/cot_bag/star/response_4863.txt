Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 2) (17, 11) (17, 0) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 17) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 3) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 4) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, namely nodes 1, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
So, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated by the formula \( \binom{12}{3} = 220 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<1, (11, 5, 8)>
<5, (11, 7, 1)>
<6, (18, 3, 1)>
<9, (8, 14, 2)>
<13, (16, 18, 8)>
<14, (9, 3, 7)>
<15, (1, 0, 2)>
<16, (11, 18, 4)>
<17, (11, 0, 19)>
<18, (16, 6, 19)>
<19, (18, 14, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [220].
