Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 0) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 29) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 6) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 13) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 2) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 28) (7, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 27) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 2) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 22) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 29) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 4) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (14, 28) (14, 4) (14, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 17) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (24, 4) (24, 13) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 25) (2, 28) (2, 6) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 14) (13, 24) (18, 21) (18, 0) (18, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in this graph.
