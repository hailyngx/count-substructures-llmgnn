Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (2, 22) (2, 3) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 10) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 11) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 28) (12, 13) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 16) (6, 21) (6, 23) (28, 18) (28, 16) (28, 24) (4, 25) (4, 18) (4, 14) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 0) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 27) (16, 28) (0, 21) (10, 29) (10, 7) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 17) (9, 24) (9, 19) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 15) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 24) (14, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (8, 11) (20, 23) (20, 19) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 3, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 56 \)
So, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (2, 24, 25)>, <7, (1, 25, 29)>, <12, (13, 22, 27)>, <13, (12, 22, 26)>, <15, (12, 17, 24)>, 
<17, (1, 15, 17)>, <18, (4, 18, 28)>, <19, (9, 19, 23)>, <21, (0, 3, 6)>, <22, (12, 18, 26)>, 
<23, (11, 19, 23)>, <24, (15, 24, 28)>, <25, (3, 4, 5)>, <26, (5, 13, 26)>, <28, (16, 18, 24)>, <29, (7, 8, 10)>
