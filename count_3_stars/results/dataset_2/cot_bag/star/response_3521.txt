Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 1, 4, 13
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 4, 0
- Node 2: 1, 8, 12, 14
- Node 3: 6, 1, 12
- Node 4: 5, 1, 8, 13, 0, 10
- Node 5: 9, 11, 4, 0
- Node 6: 10, 3, 8
- Node 7: 11, 10, 14
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 2
- Node 10: 9, 6, 4, 13, 7
- Node 11: 5, 13, 7, 12
- Node 12: 3, 2, 14, 11
- Node 13: 4, 11, 10, 0
- Node 14: 2, 7, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars defined by each node, we have a total of 68 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is [68]. 
Additionally, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 13)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 13)>, <1, (3, 4, 10)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 12)>, <4, (0, 1, 13)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 13)>, <6, (3, 8, 10)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <10, (4, 6, 9)>, <10, (4, 7, 13)>, <11, (5, 7, 13)>, <12, (2, 11, 14)>
