Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) 

Response:
With 15 nodes, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 2, 10.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, 11, 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 8, 1, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 14, 1, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 10, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 14, 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 0, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 14, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 1, 0, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 1.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 1.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 11, 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 6, 3, 10.

Now, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 14 have 3 or more neighbors.
- Summing up \( inom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 72 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].
 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 9, 1>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <1, 4, 11>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <1, 9, 2>
- <1, 9, 3>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 10>
- <2, 9, 1>
- <3, 6, 14>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <4, 9, 0>
- <4, 9, 12>
- <4, 11, 1>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <6, 8, 14>
- <7, 13, 11>
- <9, 11, 12>
- <12, 13, 11>
- <14, 8, 6>
- <14, 10, 5>
