Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 6, 7>
- <4, 1, 8, 9>
- <6, 2, 3, 8>
