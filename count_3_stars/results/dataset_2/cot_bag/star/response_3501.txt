Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (6, 8, 14)>, <2, (0, 4, 13)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 10)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 8, 13)>, <8, (0, 6, 12)>, <9, (4, 7, 11)>, <10, (5, 12, 4)>, <11, (9, 14, 4)>, <12, (8, 10, 3)>, <13, (2, 12, 7)>, <14, (6, 8, 11)>
