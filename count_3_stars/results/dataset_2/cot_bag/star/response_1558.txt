Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 19) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 12), 
(15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 18), 
(14, 17), (14, 6), 
(17, 14), (17, 6), (17, 11), 
(5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 4), 
(9, 5), (9, 13), (9, 0), 
(8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 7), 
(13, 9), (13, 19), (13, 18), (13, 6), 
(10, 15), (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 4), 
(0, 9), (0, 11), 
(2, 1), (2, 16), 
(4, 5), (4, 10), (4, 12), (4, 19), 
(12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 4), (12, 1), 
(18, 15), (18, 13), 
(19, 13), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 16), 
(7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 19), 
(16, 2), (16, 19), 
(6, 14), (6, 17), (6, 13), 
(1, 10), (1, 2), (1, 12), 
(11, 17), (11, 5), (11, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 12), (15, 3)
Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 18), (10, 15), (18, 15)
Node 14: (14, 17), (14, 6), (17, 14), (6, 14)
Node 17: (17, 14), (17, 6), (17, 11), (11, 17)
Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 4), (9, 5), (11, 5)
Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 13), (9, 0), (13, 9), (0, 9)
Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 19), (13, 18), (13, 6), (19, 13)
Node 8: (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 7), (12, 8), (7, 8)
Node 10: (10, 15), (10, 8), (10, 1), (10, 4), (1, 10)
Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 11), (11, 0)
Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 10), (4, 12), (4, 19), (12, 4), (19, 4)
Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 8), (12, 4), (12, 1), (1, 12)
Node 18: (18, 15), (18, 13), (15, 18)
Node 19: (19, 13), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 16), (16, 19)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 15: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 103

So, there are a total of [103] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, 7, 15>, 
<5, 9, 11>, 
<13, 6, 19>, 
<13, 9, 0>, 
<13, 9, 5>, 
<13, 18, 19>, 
<13, 6, 14>, 
<15, 3, 18>, 
<4, 10, 12>, 
<8, 10, 12>, 
<4, 10, 19>, 
<4, 12, 1>, 
<15, 18, 13>, 
<8, 10, 1>, 
<19, 7, 16>
