Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 8) (26, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 0) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (8, 26) (8, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 11) (4, 24) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 21) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 7) (20, 15) (20, 10) (20, 16) (2, 8) (2, 1) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 26) (17, 6) (17, 21) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 23) (7, 15) (7, 0) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 0) (23, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 23) (16, 20) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 10) (3, 14) (3, 27) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 3) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (25, 13) (25, 10) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 3) (27, 10) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can begin by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 6, 10, 11, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29. 

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 53 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [53]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 11, 23>, <6, 8, 17, 26>, <10, 20, 24, 25>, <11, 21, 23, 28>, <15, 18, 20, 7>, <18, 21, 23, 5>, <20, 15, 7, 10>, <21, 17, 26, 9>, <22, 0, 11, 28>, <24, 4, 16, 10>, <26, 8, 17, 6>, <28, 22, 0, 29>.
