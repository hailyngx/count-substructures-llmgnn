Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 3) (15, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (14, 1) (19, 10) (19, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 16, 11, 12
- Node 1: 14, 19
- Node 2: 3, 13, 10, 18
- Node 3: 15, 6, 2, 18
- Node 4: 8, 16, 15
- Node 5: 9, 15, 10
- Node 6: 3, 17, 18, 16
- Node 8: 4, 13, 17, 12
- Node 9: 5, 13
- Node 10: 5, 17, 19, 2
- Node 11: 17, 0, 12
- Node 12: 8, 0, 11
- Node 13: 9, 15, 8, 2
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 5, 4, 3, 13
- Node 16: 4, 0, 6
- Node 17: 8, 10, 6, 11
- Node 18: 3, 2, 6
- Node 19: 10, 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4+4+1+1+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 34 \). So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 13, 18)>, 
<3, (2, 15, 6)>, 
<4, (8, 15, 16)>, 
<5, (9, 10, 15)>, 
<6, (3, 16, 17)>, 
<8, (4, 13, 17)>, 
<10, (2, 17, 19)>, 
<13, (9, 15, 8)>, 
<15, (3, 4, 13)>, 
<17, (8, 10, 6)>.
