Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (4, 0), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 9). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
<0, (4, 1, 9)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (6, 1), (0, 1), (1, 8), (1, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
<1, (6, 8, 7)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (4, 2), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2.
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 7)>
<2, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<2, (8, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 3, 7)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (4, 3), (8, 3), (6, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (8, 6, 2)>
<3, (8, 6, 2)>
<3, (8, 6, 2)>
<3, (8, 6, 2)>
<3, (6, 2, 7)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 4), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
<4, (8, 0, 3)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (2, 7), (0, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 1). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.
<7, (2, 6, 9)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 3). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8.
<8, (4, 2, 5)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (8, 9), (0, 9), (2, 9), (7, 9), (9, 0). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.
<9, (8, 0, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of 53 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the answer is [53].
