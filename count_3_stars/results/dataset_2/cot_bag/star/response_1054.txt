Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 10) (27, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 18) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 24) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (29, 15) (29, 5) (28, 22) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 8) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 2) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (16, 25) (16, 26) (6, 22) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 2) (23, 11) (23, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 5) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 2) (18, 17) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 0) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 26) (10, 27) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 24) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them first:

- Node 13, with neighbors 22, 4, and 9.
- Node 22, with neighbors 13, 6, and 28.
- Node 15, with neighbors 20, 1, and 29.
- Node 28, with neighbors 22, 15, and 20.
- Node 21, with neighbors 7, 3, and 19.
- Node 20, with neighbors 15, 26, and 8.
- Node 29, with neighbors 15, 5, and 28.
- Node 3, with neighbors 21, 11, and 5.
- Node 25, with neighbors 7, 16, and 4.
- Node 8, with neighbors 20, 28, and 19.
- Node 4, with neighbors 13, 14, and 25.
- Node 6, with neighbors 22, 19, and 24.
- Node 24, with neighbors 21, 6, and 9.
- Node 1, with neighbors 15, 23, and 0.
- Node 12, with neighbors 4, 10, and 0.
- Node 16, with neighbors 25, 26, and 0.
- Node 2, with neighbors 25, 24, and 5.
- Node 5, with neighbors 29, 3, and 2.
- Node 10, with neighbors 27, 14, and 8.
- Node 9, with neighbors 13, 27, and 24.
- Node 19, with neighbors 21, 8, and 6.
- Node 0, with neighbors 1, 19, and 26.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the formula. 

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum inom{d}{3} \]

where \(d\) is the degree of the node.

For each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up:

\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 52 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 52. Thus, the answer is [52].
