Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 14. 
Let's find the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 63 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 13, 10)>
<2, (5, 11, 4)>
<2, (9, 11, 4)>
<2, (10, 14, 6)>
<4, (6, 11, 14)>
<5, (7, 2, 10)>
<7, (0, 9, 12)>
<10, (0, 8, 13)>
<10, (6, 14, 2)>
<10, (7, 12, 0)>
<11, (1, 3, 14)>
<13, (0, 7, 8)>
<13, (8, 10, 0)>
<14, (1, 3, 11)>
