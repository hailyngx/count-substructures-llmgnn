Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 5, 6, 3, 8, 13, 14, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all of these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 13)>
<13, (1, 8, 7)>
<14, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (13, 0, 6)>
