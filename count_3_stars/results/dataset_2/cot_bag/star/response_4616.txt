Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 59 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 13)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<2, (1, 9, 11)>
<3, (1, 6, 13)>
<6, (3, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 10, 13)>
<13, (0, 3, 9)>
