Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 4, 8, 6, 2, 0, and 3. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
