The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 2) (21, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 3) (19, 29) (19, 28) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 12) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (28, 19) (28, 26) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 17) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 5) (16, 18) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 26) (12, 20) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 11) (7, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 9) (20, 22) (20, 12) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 8) (27, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 23) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's identify them and count the total number of 3-stars.

1. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {22, 3, 10, 23}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 22 has 5 neighbors: {13, 14, 0, 20, 3}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {13, 3, 12, 9}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 24 has 5 neighbors: {4, 8, 26, 14, 5}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {24, 28, 0, 12}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {4, 24, 17, 6, 3}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {24, 0, 23, 29}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {1, 10, 26, 20}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 24 has 4 neighbors: {4, 8, 26, 14}. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 22 has 5 neighbors: {14, 11, 20, 0, 3}. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes above, \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
