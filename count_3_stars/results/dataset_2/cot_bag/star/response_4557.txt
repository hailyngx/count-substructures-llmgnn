Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 14) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (17, 11) (17, 9) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 19) (0, 1) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 44 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 7, 13)>
- <4, (3, 1, 19)>
- <7, (2, 1, 13)>
- <7, (10, 13, 2)>
- <7, (10, 13, 8)>
- <13, (7, 1, 10)>
- <13, (7, 10, 8)>
- <8, (11, 17, 16)>
- <10, (11, 12, 13)>
- <10, (5, 14, 10)>
- <11, (12, 10, 17)>
- <12, (10, 11, 13)>
- <16, (8, 19, 18)>
- <14, (5, 9, 14)>
- <14, (8, 5, 14)>
- <15, (6, 8, 15)>
- <15, (14, 8, 15)>
- <19, (2, 4, 16)>
