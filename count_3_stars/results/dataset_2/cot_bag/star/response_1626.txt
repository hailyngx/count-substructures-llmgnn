Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 92. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 13)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 8, 11)>
- <4, (1, 8, 10)>
- <4, (5, 6, 10)>
- <5, (2, 10, 13)>
- <6, (3, 4, 12)>
- <8, (3, 4, 14)>
- <10, (0, 9, 13)>
