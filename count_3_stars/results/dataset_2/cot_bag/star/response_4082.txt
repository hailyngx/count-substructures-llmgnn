Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 8
Node 2: 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 7
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:  

Node 0: 3-stars formed = [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>  
Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)>  
Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (4, 7, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (6, 7, 8)>  
Node 0: <0, (7, 8, 9)>  

Node 6: 3-stars formed = [inom{6}{3}] = 20  
Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 8)>   
Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (0, 7, 9)>  
Node 6: <6, (2, 7, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (7, 8, 9)>  
Node 6: <6, (7, 4, 0)>  
Node 6: <6, (5, 6, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (5, 4, 0)>  
Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>   
Node 6: <6, (0, 7, 4)>  
Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 4)>  
Node 6: <6, (0, 7, 6)>  
Node 6: <6, (0, 8, 5)>  
Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 4)>  
Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 7)>  
Node 6: <6, (7, 4, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (7, 6, 8)>  
Node 6: <6, (7, 9, 6)>  
Node 6: <6, (8, 5, 0)>  

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 20] = [30].
