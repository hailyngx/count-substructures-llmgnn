Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (23, 25) (23, 24) (12, 15) (12, 22) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 9) (21, 27) (21, 13) (28, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 10) (17, 0) (17, 22) (5, 19) (5, 29) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 25) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 20) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 6) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 2) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 11) (25, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 4) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 7) (14, 20) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 22) (4, 15) (4, 13) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 6) (20, 24) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

\[ \binom{4}{3}  + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 50. We can represent these 3-stars as follows:

\[ [50] \]

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <3, (15, 9, 19)>
- <15, (3, 24, 12)>
- <24, (3, 23, 26)>
- <26, (15, 24, 10)>
- <18, (10, 13, 7)>
- <7, (18, 16, 29)>
- <10, (26, 18, 0)>
- <2, (15, 9, 6)>
- <20, (24, 10, 11)>
- <29, (5, 7, 16), (6, 7, 16)>
- <25, (23, 19, 11), (23, 11, 22)>
- <22, (12, 17, 25), (17, 25, 6)>
