Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The number of neighbors for each node is:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors
Node 1 has 6 neighbors
Node 2 has 5 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 5 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 1: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
