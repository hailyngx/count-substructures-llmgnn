Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13}.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64 \), which gives us the final result inside brackets: [64].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (1, 0, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 10, 13)>
<8, (5, 6, 14)>
<10, (0, 7, 14)>
<13, (3, 6, 9)>
