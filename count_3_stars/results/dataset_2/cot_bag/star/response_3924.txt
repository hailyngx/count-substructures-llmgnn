Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 15) (18, 12) (18, 16) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 6, 9, 13, 17, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 5: \( \dbinom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \dbinom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \dbinom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \dbinom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \dbinom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \dbinom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up gives a total of 24 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [24]. The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 6, 12)>, <6, (5, 9, 17)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (6, 10, 7)>, <13, (0, 17, 4)>, <13, (17, 4, 2)>, <13, (17, 4, 2)>, <13, (17, 2, 10)>, <17, (6, 13, 8)>, <17, (13, 8, 4)>, <17, (13, 8, 4)>, <17, (13, 8, 2)>, <8, (17, 16, 12)>, <8, (17, 12, 3)>, <8, (17, 3, 1)>, <8, (17, 1, 19)>, <8, (12, 3, 1)>, <8, (12, 3, 1)>, <8, (12, 16, 3)>, <8, (16, 18, 12)>, <8, (16, 18, 12)>, <8, (16, 18, 3)>, <8, (1, 19, 15)>, <8, (1, 19, 15)>.
