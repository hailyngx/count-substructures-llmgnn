Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these 7 nodes.

For node 0:
Since node 0 has 5 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8, 9), the number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
The unique 3-stars around node 0 are: <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 2:
Node 2 has 6 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 2 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
The unique 3-stars around node 2 are: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>.

Similarly, we can calculate the number of 3-stars around the remaining nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>.
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star, unique 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 5)>.
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>.
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, unique 3-star: <8, (4, 9, 0)>.
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 65 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65]. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>.
