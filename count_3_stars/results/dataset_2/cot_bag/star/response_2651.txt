Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 88 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [88].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
