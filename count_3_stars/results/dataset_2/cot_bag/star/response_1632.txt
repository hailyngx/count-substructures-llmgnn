Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 49.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 2)>
<3, (8, 2, 1)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<5, (1, 9, 6)>
<5, (6, 4, 8)>
<5, (8, 7, 3)>
<5, (6, 0, 5)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 8, 2)>
<6, (8, 4, 0)>
<6, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>
