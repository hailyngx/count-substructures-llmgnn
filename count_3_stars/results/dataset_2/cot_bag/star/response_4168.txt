Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \[ [10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 10] = [92] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 92. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (7, 12, 14)>
- <1, (3, 10, 13)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 9, 10)>
- <2, (6, 9, 10)>
- <3, (1, 6, 14)>
- <3, (11, 12, 14)>
- <4, (7, 12, 14)>
- <7, (0, 1, 14)>
- <10, (5, 12, 14)>
