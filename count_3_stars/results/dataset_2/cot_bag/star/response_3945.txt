Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 11) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 4, 7, 8, 12, 0, 14, 5, 2, 11, 10, 3, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 98 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [98].
