Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (7, 9, 0, 10, 5, 6).
- The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 0, 10)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (7, 10, 5)>, <4, (7, 10, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 0, 10)>, <4, (9, 0, 5)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <4, (9, 10, 5)>, <4, (9, 10, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 10, 5)>, <4, (0, 10, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (10, 5, 6)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (4, 11, 14, 2, 13, 1).
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). <7, (4, 11, 14)>, <7, (4, 11, 2)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (4, 11, 1)>, <7, (4, 14, 2)>, <7, (4, 14, 13)>, <7, (4, 14, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 13)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 13, 1)>, <7, (11, 14, 2)>, <7, (11, 14, 13)>, <7, (11, 14, 1)>, <7, (11, 2, 13)>, <7, (11, 2, 1)>, <7, (11, 13, 1)>, <7, (14, 2, 13)>, <7, (14, 2, 1)>, <7, (14, 13, 1)>, <7, (2, 13, 1)>.

For node 13:
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors (7, 8, 2, 10, 9, 6).
- The number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). <13, (7, 8, 2)>, <13, (7, 8, 10)>, <13, (7, 8, 9)>, <13, (7, 8, 6)>, <13, (7, 2, 10)>, <13, (7, 2, 9)>, <13, (7, 2, 6)>, <13, (7, 10, 9)>, <13, (7, 10, 6)>, <13, (7, 9, 6)>, <13, (8, 2, 10)>, <13, (8, 2, 9)>, <13, (8, 2, 6)>, <13, (8, 10, 9)>, <13, (8, 10, 6)>, <13, (8, 9, 6)>, <13, (2, 10, 9)>, <13, (2, 10, 6)>, <13, (2, 9, 6)>, <13, (10, 9, 6)>.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors (7, 1, 5, 6, 9).
- The number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). <14, (7, 1, 5)>, <14, (7, 1, 6)>, <14, (7, 1, 9)>, <14, (7, 5, 6)>, <14, (7, 5, 9)>, <14, (7, 6, 9)>, <14, (1, 5, 6)>, <14, (1, 5, 9)>, <14, (1, 6, 9)>, <14, (5, 6, 9)>.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 70 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [70].
