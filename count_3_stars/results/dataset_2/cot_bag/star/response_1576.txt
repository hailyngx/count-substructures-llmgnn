Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 21) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 16) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 21) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 23) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 14) (28, 9) (28, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 29) (21, 24) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 16) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 19) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 7) (10, 5) (18, 6) (18, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (17, 22) (17, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 29) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 1) (24, 23) (24, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors
- Node 20: 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 5 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 2 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 2 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors, we find:
\[ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{29}{3} \]

\[ = 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 + 165 + 455 + 1330 + 154 + 2300 + 2600 + 2925 + 3654 \]

Summing these up we get:
\[ 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 + 165 + 455 + 1330 + 154 + 2300 + 2600 + 2925 + 3654 = 11522 \]

So, there are a total of 11,522 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as \( [11522] \).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
1. <0, (8, 20, 2)>
2. <1, (6, 14, 29)>
3. <4, (16, 19, 27)>
4. <6, (1, 18, 21)>
5. <7, (3, 14, 17)>
6. <8, (0, 20, 4)>
7. <9, (26, 25, 28)>
8. <11, (14, 22, 28)>
9. <14, (1, 5, 7)>
10. <15, (26, 3, 16)>
11. <16, (4, 12, 15)>
12. <19, (12, 1, 4)>
13. <20, (0, 8, 4)>
14. <21, (6, 24, 29)>
15. <22, (2, 14, 17)>
16. <25, (9, 26, 29)>
17. <26, (9, 15, 21)>
18. <27, (4, 12, 21)>
19. <29, (1, 25, 6)>
