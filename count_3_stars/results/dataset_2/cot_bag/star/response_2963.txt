Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 

Response:
There are nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 6, 9, 11, 5, 0, 14, and 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 70

So, there are 70 3-stars in the given graph. 

<4, 6, 7>, <7, 1, 11>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 14>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 11>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 11>, <3, 8, 12>, <3, 12, 7>, <8, 4, 14>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 14>, <8, 1, 13>, <8, 1, 11>, <13, 8, 12>, <13, 8, 4>, <13, 8, 14>, <13, 8, 2>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 14>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 11>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 10, 11>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 1, 11>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 1, 2>, <10, 6, 4>, <10, 6, 7>, <11, 7, 4>, <11, 7, 6>, <11, 7, 1>, <11, 7, 10>, <11, 1, 3>, <11, 1, 6>, <11, 1, 9>, <11, 6, 7>, <11, 6, 10> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
