Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 6, 4, 0, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 7, 0, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 0, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 1, and 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (9, 3, 6, 4, 0, 8)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (5, 1, 7, 0, 6)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 9, 1)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 3)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 0, 6)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (4, 2, 1, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [52] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 2)>
- <0, (3, 5, 4)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (9, 4, 2)>
