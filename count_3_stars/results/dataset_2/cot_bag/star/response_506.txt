Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: There are 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 6: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 7: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 9: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 10: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 11: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 12: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 14: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the possibilities: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 86 \)

Hence, there are a total of 86 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets: [86]
