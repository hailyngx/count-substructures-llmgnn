Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 2 with 6 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 5 with 5 neighbors
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors
- Node 8 with 5 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 13 with 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 76 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 13)>
<2, (9, 11, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 13)>
<4, (1, 10, 14)>
<5, (0, 1, 10)>
<7, (0, 2, 13)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<13, (2, 7, 12)>
