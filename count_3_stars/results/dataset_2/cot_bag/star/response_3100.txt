Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify these nodes and find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars and find the total:

- For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - There's one 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 10)>
  
- For Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
  
- For Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
  
- For Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
  - There are two 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 11)>, <4, (10, 11, 14)>
  
- For Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 6)>
  
- For Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 13)>
  
- For Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <10, (0, 5, 12)>
  
- For Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - There's one 3-star: <11, (4, 12, 13)>
  
- For Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - There's one 3-star: <12, (8, 10, 11)>
  
- For Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - There's one 3-star: <13, (9, 10, 11)>
  
Adding up the total number of 3-stars: $4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 92$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].
