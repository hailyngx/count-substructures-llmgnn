Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 18) (4, 17) (4, 19) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
5. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
7. Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
9. Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
10. Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
11. Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
12. Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
13. Node 17 has 5 neighbors.
14. Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
15. Node 19 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

Summing these values gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 57 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (8, 12, 14)>, 
<3, (7, 9, 19)>, 
<4, (17, 18, 19)>, 
<5, (0, 10, 13)>, 
<6, (9, 10, 13)>, 
<7, (3, 11, 14)>, 
<8, (16, 11, 3)>, 
<9, (6, 10, 13)>, 
<10, (5, 13, 15)>, 
<13, (6, 10, 15)>, 
<14, (7, 12, 19)>, 
<16, (11, 3, 8)>, 
<17, (4, 10, 18)>, 
<18, (8, 17, 1)>, 
<19, (3, 4, 9)>.
