Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 19) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 16) (19, 13) 

Response:
We can start by organizing the list of edges into a more readable format, where each node is listed along with its neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 10, 14
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9, 12
- Node 3: 0, 1, 13
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9, 18
- Node 5: 1, 9, 15, 18
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 13, 17
- Node 8: 2, 6, 11
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 16
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 8, 18
- Node 12: 2, 14, 16
- Node 13: 3, 7, 15, 19
- Node 14: 1, 12, 17
- Node 15: 5, 13, 17
- Node 16: 9, 12, 19
- Node 17: 7, 14, 15, 18
- Node 18: 4, 5, 11, 17
- Node 19: 13, 16

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in this graph = 24

Thus, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 5, 10>, <1, 3, 5, 14>, <1, 3, 10, 14>, <1, 5, 10, 14>, <2, 4, 9, 16>, <2, 4, 9, 18>, <2, 4, 16, 18>, <2, 9, 16, 18>, <4, 6, 8, 18>, <4, 6, 9, 18>, <4, 8, 9, 18>, <6, 8, 9, 18>, <1, 5, 9, 18>, <7, 13, 15, 19>, <8, 11, 18, 6>, <9, 16, 18, 11>, <9, 16, 18, 12>, <13, 15, 17, 19>, <14, 15, 17, 13>, <14, 15, 17, 17>, <1, 3, 13, 15>, <2, 12, 14, 16>, <4, 9, 12, 16>, <4, 9, 18, 11>, <4, 18, 11, 17>.
