Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 3), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 1), (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 1), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 1), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 5), (2, 1)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 2. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
