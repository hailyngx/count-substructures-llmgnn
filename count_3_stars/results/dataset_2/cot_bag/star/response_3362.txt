Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (21, 16) (21, 0) (2, 29) (2, 16) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 3) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 27) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 12) (17, 8) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 6) (18, 26) (18, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 25) (16, 8) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 12) (3, 22) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 12) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 5) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 7) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (27, 20) (27, 13) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 26) (4, 10) (4, 24) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 4) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we proceed to count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 25 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 28 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 50 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [50].

Some examples of unique 3-stars are:
<0, (21, 28, 29)>
<1, (9, 7, 24)>
<3, (22, 23, 19)>
<4, (26, 10, 24)>
<6, (29, 19, 12)>
<8, (17, 16, 14)>
<12, (28, 6, 3)>
<13, (26, 11, 27)>
<16, (21, 2, 8)>
<19, (20, 5, 3)>
<25, (20, 16, 10)>
<26, (9, 13, 18)>
<28, (9, 25, 0)>
<29, (2, 6, 24)>
