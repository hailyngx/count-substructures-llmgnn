Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 18

So, the final count of 3-stars is [18].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 9, 12)>, <1, (3, 10, 13)>, <1, (6, 11, 14)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (1, 9, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 11)>, <11, (6, 7, 14)>, <11, (3, 7, 14)>, <11, (4, 6, 7)>
