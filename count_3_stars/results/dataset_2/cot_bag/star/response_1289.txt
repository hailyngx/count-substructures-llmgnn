Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 --- 8 --- 2 --- 4 --- 14 --- 6
    |           |     |            |
    3 --- 13    1     9 --- 12      7 --- 11 --- 5 --- 10
```

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 61 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 61, which can be represented as \[61\]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 8, 2>
- <2, 8, 0>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <2, 3, 0>
- <3, 13, 6>
- <3, 6, 1>
- <3, 6, 0>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 0>
- <4, 8, 2>
- <4, 2, 14>
- <4, 2, 3>
- <5, 11, 7>
- <5, 11, 10>
- <7, 11, 5>
- <7, 11, 10>
- <9, 4, 14>
- <9, 4, 2>
- <9, 4, 3>
- <9, 12, 14>
- <10, 5, 13>
- <10, 5, 11>
- <10, 5, 1>
- <14, 4, 2>
- <14, 4, 6>
- <14, 4, 12>
- <14, 6, 0>
- <14, 6, 13>
