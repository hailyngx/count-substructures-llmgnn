Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total} = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (9, 0, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 4, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>
