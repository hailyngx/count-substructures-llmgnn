Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 16) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 15) (18, 8) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are 3, 15, 10, 17, 8, 7, 5, 19, 16, 12, 1, 6, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 7, 4, 8, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3, 18, 16, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 19, 9, hence no 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 12, 9, 8, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 17, 2, 18, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 0, 5, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 7, 19, 16, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 10, 5, 12, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 15, 5, 12, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 17, 19, 16, 13, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 9, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 1, 4, 13, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 1, 6, 14, 9, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 10, 17, 1, 4, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

So there are a total of [42] unique 3-stars in the graph. Now, let's list them inside <>:
