Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are six nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 10, and 1. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 5:
There are 5 neighbors of node 5: 9, 2, 12, 1, 11.
The number of 3-stars around node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
<5, (9, 2, 12)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 11)>, <5, (9, 12, 1)>, <5, (9, 12, 11)>, <5, (9, 1, 11)>, <5, (2, 12, 1)>, <5, (2, 12, 11)>, <5, (2, 1, 11)>, <5, (12, 1, 11)>

For node 9:
There are 7 neighbors of node 9: 5, 4, 2, 10, 1, 7, 11.
The number of 3-stars around node 9 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).
<9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 10)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 11)>, <9, (5, 2, 10)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 11)>, <9, (5, 10, 1)>, <9, (5, 10, 7)>, <9, (5, 10, 11)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 11)>, <9, (5, 7, 11)>, <9, (4, 2, 10)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 1)>, <9, (4, 10, 7)>, <9, (4, 10, 11)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 11)>, <9, (4, 7, 11)>, <9, (2, 10, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 7)>, <9, (2, 10, 11)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 11)>, <9, (2, 7, 11)>, <9, (10, 1, 7)>, <9, (10, 1, 11)>, <9, (10, 7, 11)>, <9, (1, 7, 11)>

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors of node 4: 9, 12, 0, 14.
The number of 3-stars around node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<4, (9, 12, 0)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 0, 14)>, <4, (12, 0, 14)>

For node 7:
There are 4 neighbors of node 7: 9, 11, 2, 1.
The number of 3-stars around node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<7, (9, 11, 2)>, <7, (9, 11, 1)>, <7, (9, 2, 1)>, <7, (11, 2, 1)>

For node 10:
There are 4 neighbors of node 10: 9, 11, 13, 2.
The number of 3-stars around node 10 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<10, (9, 11, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 2)>, <10, (9, 13, 2)>, <10, (11, 13, 2)>

For node 1:
There are 4 neighbors of node 1: 5, 9, 7, 13.
The number of 3-stars around node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (5, 7, 13)>, <1, (9, 7, 13)>

There are \( 10 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61 \) 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [61].
