Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars it is part of:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (9, 1, 8, 7), forming 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (5, 4, 0, 8), forming 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (6, 4, 8, 7), forming 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (9, 6, 7, 4), forming 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 2), forming 1 3-star
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (9, 6, 8, 1, 7), forming 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (5, 3, 2), forming 1 3-star
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (5, 9, 3, 2, 0), forming 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (5, 1, 2, 0), forming 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 0), forming 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [28]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<5, (7, 9, 3)>
<5, (1, 0, 8)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 5)>
<7, (3, 2, 0)>
<7, (9, 5, 3)>
