The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 21) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 24) (29, 3) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 6) (24, 29) (24, 3) (26, 12) (26, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 11) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 17) (21, 9) (21, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 22) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 15) (0, 1) (0, 28) (3, 29) (3, 24) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 23) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 20) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 19) (19, 7) (19, 20) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 5) (9, 1) (9, 21) (18, 7) (18, 27) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (23, 6) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 28) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {8, 15, 9, 0}.  
For node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<1, (8, 15, 9)>,  <1, (8, 15, 0)>,  <1, (8, 9, 0)>,  <1, (15, 9, 0)> 

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {29, 20}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {29, 24}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {14, 26, 15, 22}.   
For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<4, (14, 26, 15)>, <4, (14, 26, 22)>,  <4, (14, 15, 22)>, <4, (26, 15, 22)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {22, 25, 10}.  
For node 5, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
<5, (22, 25, 10)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {17, 13, 23}.  
For node 6, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
<6, (17, 13, 23)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {20, 19, 10, 18}.  
For node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<7, (20, 19, 10)>, <7, (20, 19, 18)>,  <7, (20, 10, 18)>, <7, (19, 10, 18)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {29, 13, 12, 1}.  
For node 8, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<8, (29, 13, 12)>,  <8, (29, 13, 1)>, <8, (29, 12, 1)>, <8, (13, 12, 1)>

Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {14, 8, 15, 27, 6}.  
For node 13, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
<13, (14, 8, 15)>, <13, (14, 8, 27)>, <13, (14, 8, 6)>, <13, (14, 15, 27)>, <13, (14, 15, 6)>, <13, (14, 27, 6)>, <13, (8, 15, 27)>, <13, (8, 15, 6)>, <13, (8, 27, 6)>, <13, (15, 27, 6)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {22, 25, 27}.  
For node 16, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
<16, (22, 25, 27)>

Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {20, 25, 7}.  
For node 19, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
<19, (20, 25, 7)>

Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {2, 28, 7, 19}.  
For node 20, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<20, (2, 28, 7)>, <20, (2, 28, 19)>, <20, (2, 7, 19)>, <20, (28, 7, 19)>

Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {16, 21, 4, 5}.  
For node 22, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<22, (16, 21, 4)>, <22, (16, 21, 5)>, <22, (16, 4, 5)>, <22, (21, 4, 5)>

Node 24 has 2 neighbors: {29, 3}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

Node 28 has 5 neighbors: {0, 12, 27, 10, 20}.  
For node 28, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
<28, (0, 12, 27)>, <28, (0, 12, 10)>, <28, (0, 12, 20)>, <28, (0, 27, 10)>, <28, (0, 27, 20)>, <28, (0, 10, 20)>, <28, (12, 27, 10)>, <28, (12, 27, 20)>, <28, (12, 10, 20)>, <28, (27, 10, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 41.    

So, the final answer is [41].
