Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 76\)

So, the final number inside brackets is [76].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 13)>
<5, (6, 11, 13)>
<6, (0, 3, 12)>
<10, (1, 6, 7)>
<12, (5, 8, 14)>
<14, (4, 7, 12)>
