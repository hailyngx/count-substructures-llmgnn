Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 7) (9, 27) (15, 27) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 4) (2, 3) (29, 7) (29, 14) (12, 16) (12, 26) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 24) (20, 28) (11, 28) (28, 20) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 22) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 28) (22, 4) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 23) (4, 5) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 23) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 1) (25, 26) (25, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (21, 0) (21, 13) (21, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 8) (24, 20) (24, 17) (24, 6) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 23) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 18) (19, 25) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 16) (13, 10) (13, 21) (13, 14) (13, 18) (26, 12) (26, 25) (14, 29) (14, 13) (18, 20) (18, 8) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 28.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 22, and 27.
- Using \( \binom{3}{3} \) for node 5, we find that there is 1 3-star formed with node 5.
- Therefore, we have <5, (9, 22, 27)> as a 3-star.

For node 28:
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 20, 11, and 17.
- Using \( \binom{3}{3} \) for node 28, we find that there is 1 3-star formed with node 28.
- Therefore, we have <28, (20, 11, 17)> as a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
