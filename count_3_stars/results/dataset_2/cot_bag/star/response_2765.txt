Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 23) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 8) (7, 18) (5, 18) (5, 24) (5, 28) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 27) (4, 13) (4, 6) (17, 22) (17, 0) (25, 24) (25, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (10, 24) (10, 13) (10, 23) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (19, 15) (19, 2) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 16) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 29) (6, 16) (29, 3) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 27) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 6) (16, 20) (20, 2) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 11) (14, 20) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 3, 15, 18, 22, 5, 24, 26, 27, and 29. 

For node 3, we have 6 neighbors, so we will form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 

For node 15, we have 3 neighbors, so we will form 1 3-star. 

For nodes 18, 22, 5, and 24, each has 5 neighbors, so we will form 10 3-stars for each. 

For nodes 26, 27, and 29, each has 5 neighbors, so we will form 10 3-stars for each.

Adding these up: 20 (from 3) + 1 (from 15) + 10 (from 18) + 10 (from 22) + 10 (from 5) + 10 (from 24) + 10 (from 26) + 10 (from 27) + 10 (from 29) = 81 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed by this graph is [81].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (0, 6, 16)>, <15, (19, 23, 15)>, <18, (7, 8, 5)>, <22, (17, 29, 26)>, <5, (24, 28, 18)>, <24, (5, 10, 25)>, <26, (11, 16, 2)>, <27, (21, 1, 9)>, <29, (6, 21, 23)>.
