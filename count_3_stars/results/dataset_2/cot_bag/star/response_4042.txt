Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 10) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 17) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 17) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 5) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 3) (8, 11) (8, 16) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 16) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 13) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 14) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 15, and 0), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). There is one 3-star: <1, (2, 15, 0)>.

For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 17, and 9), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 17)>, <3, (2, 17, 9)>, <3, (5, 17, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>.

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 12, 11, 17, and 14), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars: <6, (12, 11, 17)>, <6, (12, 17, 14)>, <6, (11, 17, 14)>, <6, (12, 11, 14)>.

For node 11, there are also 4 neighbors (nodes 19, 6, 17, and 8), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars: <11, (19, 6, 17)>, <11, (19, 17, 8)>, <11, (6, 17, 8)>, <11, (19, 6, 8)>.

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 19, 9, and 16), so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). There are four unique 3-stars: <13, (4, 19, 9)>, <13, (4, 9, 16)>, <13, (19, 9, 16)>, <13, (4, 19, 16)>.

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17, so the final answer is [17].
