Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

1: 4, 7, 8, 2    
2: 5, 9, 1, 3   
3: 5, 9, 4, 2    
4: 1, 6, 3    
5: 9, 6, 2, 0, 3    
6: 5, 4, 7, 8, 0, 2    
7: 0, 6, 1    
8: 0, 6, 1    
9: 5, 2, 3, 0    

Let's find the 3-stars:    
From node 5: <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 3, 0)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 0)>    
From node 6: <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <6, (4, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 2, 6)>, <6, (8, 1, 0)>    
From node 0: <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>, <0, (7, 1, 8)>    
From node 1: <1, (4, 7, 8)>    
From node 2: <2, (5, 9, 3)>    
From node 3: <3, (5, 9, 4)>    
From node 4: <4, (1, 7, 8)>    

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
