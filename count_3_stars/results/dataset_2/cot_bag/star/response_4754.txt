Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 17) (0, 1) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 21) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 28) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 10) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 10) (7, 19) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 12) (21, 16) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 6) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 24) (9, 28) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 3) (28, 20) (28, 9) (28, 25) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 25) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 21) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 15) (15, 29) (15, 22) (15, 6) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 23) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [50] \)

Therefore, there are 50 unique 3-stars in this graph.
