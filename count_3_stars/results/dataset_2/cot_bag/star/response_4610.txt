Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 17) (9, 3) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 0) (6, 3) (14, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

1. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 12, 16, 19, 18.
2. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 16, 13, 1.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 18, 19, 10, 15.
4. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 7, 4, 5, 5.
5. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 8, 16, 15, 11.
6. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 7, 12, 17.
7. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 12, 13, 11.
8. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 12, 1, 0.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 14, 17.
10. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 13, 3, 6.
11. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, 6.
12. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 17, 1, 19.
13. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 7, 4, 3.
14. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 18, 3, 10.
15. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 1, 5.
16. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3.
17. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 8, 14.
18. Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 3.
19. Node 14 has 1 neighbor: 8.
20. Node 15 has 1 neighbor: 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.

This gives a total of 15 3-stars.
Putting this information together, we have [] = [15].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<7, 12, 14, 8>
<12, 7, 18, 4>
<4, 18, 7, 19>
<18, 7, 16, 17>
<17, 8, 14, 2>
<16, 12, 13, 1>
<1, 12, 16, 7>
<13, 12, 1, 0>
<8, 17, 16, 15>
<0, 13, 1, 11>
<3, 9, 5, 10>
<11, 17, 8, 14>
<19, 7, 18, 5>
<5, 18, 4, 10>
<10, 4, 15, 17>
