Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we'll first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 1), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 2), (0, 8), (0, 3), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7 -> total possible 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 -> total possible 3-stars = C(6, 3) = 20
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 -> total possible 3-stars = C(6, 3) = 20
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 -> total possible 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6 -> total possible 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7 -> only 1 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 59

Therefore, the final answer is [59]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
