Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (5, 15) (5, 0) (19, 3) (6, 1) (6, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 7) (9, 13) (9, 7) (18, 13) (18, 1) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 8 with 4 neighbors and node 16 with 4 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 8:
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For node 16:
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4] = 8. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<8, (14, 13, 11)>
<8, (14, 13, 16)>
<8, (13, 11, 16)>
<8, (11, 3, 16)>
<16, (8, 15, 2)>
<16, (8, 15, 7)>
<16, (8, 7, 2)>
<16, (15, 2, 7)>
