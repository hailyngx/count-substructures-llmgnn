Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three neighbors, so we can look at each of these nodes to count the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 11, 7).
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

12. Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (5, 8, 0, 12, 14).
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 78
Therefore, the final answer is [78].
