Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 0.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
  
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Adding these up, we get \(10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 67\).  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [67].  
  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<6, 9, 3>  
<6, 9, 4>  
<6, 2, 5>  
<4, 8, 5>  
<4, 2, 5>  
<3, 9, 1>  
<7, 1, 9>  
<1, 2, 0>
