Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 12) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 40 nodes in the graph. First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 15, 7)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 9, 7, 14)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 11, 18, 1)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 19, 15)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 11, 17, 0)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 10, 8, 1, 3)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 15, 14, 3)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 7, 13, 14)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 18, 6, 4)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 18, 2, 15)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 10, 17, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 9, 10, 13, 3)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 12)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 13, 6, 8, 18)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 11, 17, 4, 12)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 15.

Therefore, []

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 4, 15>
<3, 9, 14>
<4, 11, 18>
<5, 9, 15>
<6, 11, 17>
<7, 1, 3>
<9, 5, 15>
<10, 7, 14>
<11, 4, 18>
<12, 15, 18>
<13, 10, 14>
<14, 9, 13>
<15, 1, 12>
<17, 6, 18>
<18, 4, 12>
