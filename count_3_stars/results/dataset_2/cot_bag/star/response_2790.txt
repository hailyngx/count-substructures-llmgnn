Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13}

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 12.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 12.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 12.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (5, 6, 12)>, <5, (2, 6, 12)>, <6, (2, 5, 12)>, and <12, (2, 5, 6)>.
