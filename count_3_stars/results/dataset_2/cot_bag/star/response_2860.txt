Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
For this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 5, 14, 11
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 14, 1
- Node 11 has 7 neighbors: 4, 7, 10, 1, 5, 8, 4
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 11, 13, 9, 5, 3, 1
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 8, 2, 9, 0, 6
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 10, 8, 13, 0, 12
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 10, 13, 0, 3
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 13, 6, 9
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 3
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 2, 5
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 8, 2
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 6
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 11, 8, 12
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 13, 12, 1

Total 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 forms inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 13 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 92
Therefore, there are [92] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 14, 11)>, <7, (4, 14, 1)>, <11, (4, 7, 10)>, <11, (4, 7, 5)>, <11, (7, 10, 1)>, <11, (7, 10, 5)>, <11, (4, 1, 5)>, <11, (7, 1, 5)>, <11, (4, 1, 8)>, <11, (7, 1, 8)>, <11, (8, 13, 9)>, <11, (8, 13, 0)>, <11, (8, 9, 0)>, <11, (13, 9, 0)>, <8, (11, 13, 9)>, <8, (11, 13, 6)>, <8, (11, 9, 6)>, <8, (11, 5, 12)>, <8, (13, 9, 12)>, <8, (13, 0, 6)>, <13, (8, 9, 12)>, <13, (8, 9, 0)>, <13, (8, 9, 6)>, <13, (8, 0, 6)>, <13, (9, 0, 6)>, <9, (10, 13, 12)>, <9, (10, 13, 6)>, <9, (10, 0, 6)>, <9, (13, 12, 6)>, <6, (10, 13, 0)>, <0, (13, 6, 9)>, <14, (4, 7, 3)>, <12, (9, 2, 5)>, <1, (7, 11, 8)>, <3, (8, 14, 6)>, <5, (4, 11, 8)>, <5, (11, 8, 12)>, <2, (13, 12, 1)>
