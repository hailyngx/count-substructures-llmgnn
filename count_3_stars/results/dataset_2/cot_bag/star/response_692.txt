Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 6, and 12.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the center. 

There's one more 3-star with node 14 as the center, formed by the edges (14, 5), (14, 9), and (14, 3).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = [35]\).

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 5, 10)>, <1, (0, 5, 12)>, <1, (0, 10, 12)>, <1, (5, 10, 12)>, <1, (5, 10, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <1, (0, 10, 14)>, <1, (5, 12, 14)>, <1, (0, 12, 14)>, <1, (0, 5, 14)>, <3, (1, 13, 14)>, <3, (9, 13, 14)>, <3, (1, 9, 14)>, <3, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 10)>, <6, (7, 10, 12)>, <6, (0, 7, 6)>, <6, (0, 7, 10)>.
