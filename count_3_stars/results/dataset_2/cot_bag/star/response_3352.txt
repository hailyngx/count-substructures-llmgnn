Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 59 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (7, 12, 14)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 11)>
<6, (0, 11, 12)>
<6, (7, 8, 12)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 12)>
<8, (6, 7, 14)>
<10, (1, 2, 12)>
<11, (2, 10, 12)>
<12, (7, 9, 13)>
<14, (4, 8, 11)>
