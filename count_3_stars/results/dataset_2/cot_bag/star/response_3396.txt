Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (7, 9, 5, 6)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (4, 1, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (6, 9, 2, 5, 1)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 2, 0)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 1, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed around node 4.
2. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed around node 6.
3. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed around node 8.
4. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed around node 9.
5. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed around node 5.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
1. <4, (7, 5, 9)>
2. <4, (7, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (9, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (9, 5, 6)>
5. <6, (1, 8, 0)>
6. <6, (1, 8, 5)>
7. <6, (3, 8, 5)>
8. <6, (3, 1, 5)>
9. <8, (6, 9, 1)>
10. <8, (6, 9, 5)>
11. <8, (6, 1, 5)>
12. <8, (6, 1, 0)>
13. <8, (9, 2, 5)>
14. <8, (9, 2, 0)>
15. <9, (4, 7, 8)>
16. <9, (4, 7, 5)>
17. <9, (4, 8, 2)>
18. <9, (4, 8, 1)>

23. <5, (7, 4, 8)>
24. <5, (7, 4, 9)>
