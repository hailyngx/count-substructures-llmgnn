Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 9) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars is as follows:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors,
Node 3 has 4 neighbors,
Node 4 has 3 neighbors,
Node 8 has 4 neighbors,
Node 5 has 4 neighbors,
Node 6 has 2 neighbors,
Node 0 has 4 neighbors,
Node 12 has 5 neighbors,
Node 2 has 5 neighbors,
Node 9 has 6 neighbors,
Node 10 has 4 neighbors,
Node 11 has 3 neighbors,
Node 13 has 3 neighbors,
Node 7 has 6 neighbors,

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ \begin{align*} 
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} 
\end{align*} \]

\[ = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 82 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 82 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ \text{<1, (6, 0, 7)>} \]
\[ \text{<3, (9, 0, 8)>} \]
\[ \text{<4, (9, 0, 12)>} \]
\[ \text{<8, (3, 5, 10)>} \]
\[ \text{<5, (2, 11, 7)>} \]
\[ \text{<12, (4, 11, 2)>} \]
\[ \text{<9, (13, 7, 2)>} \]
\[ \text{<2, (6, 14, 12)>} \]
\[ \text{<10, (1, 13, 14)>} \]
\[ \text{<13, (10, 7, 9)>} \]
\[ \text{<7, (1, 8, 14)>} \]
