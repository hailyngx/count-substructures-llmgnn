Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 19) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 19) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we have the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 12, 19}
- Node 5: {13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 16}
- Node 7: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 14}
- Node 9: {12}
- Node 10: {11, 17}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 4, 9, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 7, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 11, 19}
- Node 15: {13, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {11, 17}
- Node 19: {4, 12, 14}

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a final count of [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 12, 16)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 12, 19)>, <12, (1, 4, 19)>, <13, (7, 15, 5)>, <16, (1, 3, 6)>, <17, (10, 11, 15)>, <19, (12, 14, 4)>
