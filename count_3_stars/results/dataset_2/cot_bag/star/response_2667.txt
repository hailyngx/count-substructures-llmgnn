Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the 3-stars together: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 2)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- <1, (5, 7, 6)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 7)>
- <2, (7, 5, 1)>
- <2, (7, 5, 3)>
- <2, (7, 5, 6)>
- <2, (7, 5, 1)>
- <3, (5, 7, 2)>
- <3, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 2, 3)>
- <5, (7, 2, 6)>
- <5, (7, 2, 1)>
- <5, (7, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 5)>
- <8, (2, 7, 5)>
