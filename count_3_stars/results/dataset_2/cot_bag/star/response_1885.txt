Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 1: Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

3. Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 4: Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

5. Node 5: Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 7: Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

7. Node 9: Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\( 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 64 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
