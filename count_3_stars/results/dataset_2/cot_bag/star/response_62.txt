Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0) 

Response:
There are some nodes which have three or more neighbors, let's list those and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 17, 19, 12  
Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 16, 3, 2  
Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 17, 11, 0  
Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 15, 16  
Node 11 has neighbors: 1, 10, 6  
Node 13 has neighbors: 7, 15, 0  
Node 16 has neighbors: 4, 10, 5, 12  
Node 18 has neighbors: 7, 14, 1, 0  
Node 19 has neighbors: 8, 1, 2, 9  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 2, 4, 16, and 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 6, 10, 11, 13, and 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Summing up all the 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:  <2, (4, 17, 19)>, <4, (7, 16, 3)>, <6, (7, 17, 11)>, <10, (11, 15, 16)>, <11, (1, 10, 6)>, <13, (7, 15, 0)>, <16, (4, 10, 5)>, <18, (7, 14, 1)>, <19, (8, 1, 9)>.
