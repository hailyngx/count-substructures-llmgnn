Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 81 \)

Thus, there are a total of [81] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 2)>
<2, (8, 13, 7)>
<2, (8, 14, 0)>
<3, (7, 11, 9)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 10)>
<7, (12, 14, 2)>
<8, (13, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 11, 5)>
<11, (0, 3, 9)>
<13, (8, 2, 7)>
<14, (12, 2, 0)>
