Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 12) (26, 5) (26, 21) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 27) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 13) (20, 17) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (6, 13) (21, 26) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 15) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 24) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 22) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 4) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 27) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 24) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 1) (7, 28) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 25) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 4) (27, 17) (27, 5) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 0) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 29) (18, 10) (18, 25) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 28) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 19, 24, 25}
- Node 2: {11, 23, 28}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 5: {26, 27, 29}
- Node 6: {13, 20, 21, 23}
- Node 7: {28}
- Node 8: {10, 19, 22, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 12, 26}
- Node 10: {8, 13, 18}
- Node 11: {2, 19, 21, 25}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 16}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 29}
- Node 14: {3, 17}
- Node 15: {0, 16, 21, 24}
- Node 16: {12, 15, 24}
- Node 17: {14, 20, 22, 27}
- Node 18: {10, 25}
- Node 19: {1, 8, 11}
- Node 20: {6, 17}
- Node 21: {6, 11, 15, 26}
- Node 22: {17, 8, 24}
- Node 23: {2, 6, 25}
- Node 24: {1, 15, 16, 22}
- Node 25: {1, 11, 18, 23}
- Node 26: {5, 9, 21}
- Node 27: {5, 17}
- Node 28: {2, 7}
- Node 29: {5, 8, 13}

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ [11] \]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 4, 19)>
<4, (3, 9, 14)>
<6, (13, 20, 23)>
<8, (10, 18, 29)>
<11, (2, 19, 25)>
<15, (0, 16, 24)>
<16, (12, 15, 24)>
<17, (14, 20, 27)>
<21, (6, 11, 26)>
<24, (1, 15, 22)>
<25, (11, 18, 23)>
