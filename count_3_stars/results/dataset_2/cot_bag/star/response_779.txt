Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 15) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (0, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (15, 5) (15, 10) (15, 14) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (13, 7) (13, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors.

Let's list the nodes with their degree:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 2
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 2
- Node 14: 5
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 3

Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 14, 16, 18 have degrees greater than 3, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them.

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (14, 15, 3)>
- <3, (4, 14, 18)>
- <4, (16, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 8, 13)>
- <8, (12, 1, 18)>
- <14, (9, 2, 1)>
- <16, (12, 4, 19)>
- <18, (3, 8, 13)>
