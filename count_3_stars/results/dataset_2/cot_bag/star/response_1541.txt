Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (10, 11, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 15)>
<4, (1, 16, 18)>
<5, (6, 9, 10)>
<9, (5, 13, 14)>
<10, (0, 5, 16)>
<13, (0, 3, 9)>
<14, (9, 11, 17)>
<15, (1, 6, 17)>
<17, (14, 15, 18)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
