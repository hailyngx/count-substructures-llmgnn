Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (14, 11, 10, 11)
- Number of 3-stars using node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (14, 11, 10)>
<1, (14, 11, 1)>
<1, (14, 10, 11)>
<1, (11, 10, 1)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (7, 8, 13, 15, 11)
- Number of 3-stars using node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (7, 8, 13)>
<2, (7, 8, 15)>
<2, (7, 13, 15)>
<2, (8, 13, 15)>
<2, (8, 13, 11)>
<2, (8, 15, 11)>
<2, (13, 15, 11)>
<2, (13, 15, 2)>
<2, (13, 11, 2)>
<2, (15, 11, 2)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (17, 16, 5, 5)
- Number of 3-stars using node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (17, 16, 5)>
<3, (17, 16, 5)>
<3, (17, 5, 5)>
<3, (16, 5, 5)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (17, 3, 12, 18)
- Number of 3-stars using node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (17, 3, 12)>
<5, (17, 3, 18)>
<5, (17, 12, 18)>
<5, (3, 12, 18)>

Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (11, 0, 8, 1)
- Number of 3-stars using node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<10, (11, 0, 8)>
<10, (11, 0, 1)>
<10, (11, 8, 1)>
<10, (0, 8, 1)>

Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (14, 10, 1, 2)
- Number of 3-stars using node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<11, (14, 10, 1)>
<11, (14, 10, 2)>
<11, (14, 1, 2)>
<11, (10, 1, 2)>

Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (5, 0, 15)
- Number of 3-stars using node 12: 1
<12, (5, 0, 15)>

Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (17, 11, 1, 19)
- Number of 3-stars using node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (17, 11, 1)>
<14, (17, 11, 19)>
<14, (17, 1, 19)>
<14, (11, 1, 19)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors: (9, 3, 18)
- Number of 3-stars using node 16: 1
<16, (9, 3, 18)>

Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9, 14, 4)
- Number of 3-stars using node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<19, (6, 9, 14)>
<19, (6, 9, 4)>
<19, (6, 14, 4)>
<19, (9, 14, 4)>

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
