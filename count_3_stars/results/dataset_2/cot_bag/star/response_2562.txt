Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9:  4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
