Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 17) (27, 24) (27, 28) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 24) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 29) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (1, 20) (1, 5) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 17) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 16) (7, 12) (7, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 7) (25, 7) (25, 6) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 8) (19, 5) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 29) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 2) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 16) (9, 23) (9, 21) (9, 3) (13, 6) (18, 20) (18, 6) (18, 28) (28, 27) (28, 20) (28, 18) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 25) (6, 13) (6, 18) (17, 15) (17, 23) (17, 26) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors 4, 14, 16, 21
- Node 2: Neighbors 3, 14, 21, 24
- Node 3: Neighbors 2, 5, 9, 23
- Node 4: Neighbors 0, 8, 10, 14
- Node 6: Neighbors 13, 18, 22, 25, 26
- Node 8: Neighbors 4, 8, 19, 29
- Node 9: Neighbors 3, 9, 21, 23
- Node 10: Neighbors 4, 11, 12
- Node 12: Neighbors 7, 10, 14
- Node 14: Neighbors 0, 2, 12, 26
- Node 16: Neighbors 0, 20, 29
- Node 17: Neighbors 15, 23, 26
- Node 18: Neighbors 6, 20, 28
- Node 20: Neighbors 1, 15, 18, 28
- Node 21: Neighbors 0, 2, 9
- Node 22: Neighbors 6, 23
- Node 23: Neighbors 3, 9, 17, 22
- Node 24: Neighbors 2, 11, 27
- Node 26: Neighbors 6, 14, 17, 26, 29
- Node 28: Neighbors 18, 20, 27
- Node 29: Neighbors 8, 16, 26, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in this graph.
