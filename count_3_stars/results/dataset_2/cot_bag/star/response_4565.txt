Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 10) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 17) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 19) (4, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (18, 16) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (14, 13) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 11) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 2) (11, 18) (11, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 0, 13, 15, 8, 10, 17, 2, 16, 18, and 11. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38 \)

So, there are 38 3-stars in total. 

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 2, 15>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <1, 9, 15>, <1, 13, 15>, <1, 13, 9>, <1, 15, 9>, <1, 15, 13>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 1, 13>, <3, 1, 19>, <3, 8, 13>, <3, 8, 19>, <3, 13, 19>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 12>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 13>, <5, 12, 13>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 8, 0>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 13>, <0, 6, 17>, <0, 7, 13>, <0, 7, 17>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 13, 17>, <0, 17, 10>, <0, 17, 13>, <12, 5, 15>, <12, 5, 10>, <12, 5, 13>, <12, 15, 10>, <12, 15, 13>, <12, 10, 13>
