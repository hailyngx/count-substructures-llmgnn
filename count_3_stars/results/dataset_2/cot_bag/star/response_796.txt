Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 21) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (29, 14) (29, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 27) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (21, 4) (21, 0) (21, 12) (0, 21) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 2) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 18) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 18) (26, 10) (26, 17) (2, 7) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 27) (22, 14) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 25) (10, 8) (10, 29) (10, 26) (19, 22) (19, 20) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 3) (24, 9) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 17) (1, 2) (1, 25) (20, 19) (20, 27) (18, 13) (18, 23) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 3) (25, 22) (25, 1) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 27) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 12) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 17) (15, 8) (15, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
