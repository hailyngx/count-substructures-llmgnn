Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 16) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 2) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 20) (13, 0) (13, 16) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 5) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 21) (21, 0) (21, 16) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 7) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (19, 20) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 20) (7, 8) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 12) (20, 6) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 25) (9, 11) (6, 20) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are certain nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 16, 20, 22, and 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 23 and 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 16, 21, and 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (4, 12, 14)>
- <3, (8, 11, 22)>
- <4, (1, 12, 17)>
- <8, (3, 7, 2)>
- <11, (18, 2, 22)>
- <12, (4, 17, 20)>
- <16, (13, 21, 27)>
- <22, (3, 5, 11)>
- <23, (3, 4, 25)>
- <27, (15, 16, 25)>
- <1, (4, 10, 17)>
