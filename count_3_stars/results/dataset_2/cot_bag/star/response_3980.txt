Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (15, 8, 6), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (15, 14, 13, 18, 19), so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (9, 17, 16), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (4, 10, 17, 0), so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 2, 14, 16), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (17, 6, 8, 1), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (7, 16, 18), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (3, 17, 16, 19), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors (3, 9, 7), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (3, 0, 11, 18), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 12, 13), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (5, 10, 13, 8), so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors (3, 12, 19), so it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding these up:
1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [43]. Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 15, 6)>
<3, (13, 18, 19)>
<5, (9, 16, 17)>
<8, (0, 10, 17)>
<9, (5, 14, 16)>
<10, (1, 8, 17)>
<12, (16, 18, 7)>
<13, (3, 16, 19)>
<14, (3, 7, 9)>
<15, (3, 18, 11)>
<16, (12, 13, 5)>
<17, (8, 10, 13)>
<18, (3, 12, 19)>
