Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 7) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's first list those nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 7, 11}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
