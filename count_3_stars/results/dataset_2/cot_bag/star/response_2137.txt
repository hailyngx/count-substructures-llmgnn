Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: 7, 3, 9, 5, 2
- 1: 4, 3, 6, 5
- 2: 3, 6, 0
- 3: 1, 0, 9, 2, 5
- 4: 8, 9, 1, 6
- 5: 1, 3, 6, 0
- 6: 4, 1, 5, 2, 8
- 7: 0, 9, 8
- 8: 4, 7, 6
- 9: 4, 7, 3, 0

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 5)>
<3, (1, 9, 2)>
<3, (9, 0, 5)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
