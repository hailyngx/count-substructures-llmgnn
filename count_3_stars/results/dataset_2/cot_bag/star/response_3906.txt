Following the provided instructions, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 55 3-stars in the graph: \([55]\)
