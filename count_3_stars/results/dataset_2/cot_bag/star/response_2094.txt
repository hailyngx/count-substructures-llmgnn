Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 have at least three neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

1. Node 0: From its neighbors (1, 3, 4, 2, 5), node 0 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
   
2. Node 1: From its neighbors (9, 5, 0, 8), node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

3. Node 2: From its neighbors (6, 9, 4, 5, 0), node 2 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 

4. Node 3: From its neighbors (9, 7, 5, 0), node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

5. Node 5: From its neighbors (1, 3, 7, 2, 0), node 5 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 

6. Node 6: From its neighbors (9, 7, 2, 4), node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

7. Node 7: From its neighbors (6, 3, 8, 5), node 7 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

8. Node 9: From its neighbors (6, 2, 3, 1), node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<2, (6, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (9, 7, 5)>
