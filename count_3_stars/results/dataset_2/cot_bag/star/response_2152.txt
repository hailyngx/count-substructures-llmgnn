Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
This graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (10, 11, 13)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 12)>, <7, (2, 9, 12)>, <9, (6, 7, 10)>, <10, (1, 6, 13)>, <11, (1, 5, 14)>, <12, (6, 7, 8)>, <13, (1, 10, 2)>, <14, (5, 11, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].
