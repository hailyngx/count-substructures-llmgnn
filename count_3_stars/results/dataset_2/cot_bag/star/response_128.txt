Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
We'll analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 58 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>
