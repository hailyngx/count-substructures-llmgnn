Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows: 

```
    1 -- 2 -- 3
    |    |    |
    4 -- 5    6
          |
          7 -- 8
              |
              9
```

We can see that nodes 5, 6, 2, 4, and 0 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes. 

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [42] \)

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are: 
<5, (2, 4, 0)> 
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 0, 7)>
