Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges can be visualized as follows:

```
        0 --- 7 --- 2
        |     |     |
        |     |     |
        5 --- 1 --- 8
               | /
               |/
               6

            3 --- 9
            |     |
            |     |
            4 --- -
```

Based on the provided edges, we see that nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 4:
   - Since node 4 has 5 neighbors (7, 8, 9, 6, 3), the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   - <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (8, 6, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 9, 6)>

2. Node 7:
   - Since node 7 has 5 neighbors (4, 0, 6, 2, 5), the number of 3-stars centered at node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   - <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>, <7, (0, 6, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 6, 2)>

3. Node 8:
   - Since node 8 has 5 neighbors (4, 1, 2, 9, 6), the number of 3-stars centered at node 8 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   - <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 9)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 9, 6)>, <8, (4, 1, 2, 9)>

4. Node 9:
   - Since node 9 has 4 neighbors (4, 3, 8, 2), the number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   - <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 2)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 34\).
