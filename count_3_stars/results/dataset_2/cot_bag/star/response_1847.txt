Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 10) (8, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 69

Therefore, the final answer is [69].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <1, 7, 13>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <3, 8, 10>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <7, 13, 14>
- <9, 10, 13>
- <10, 13, 7>
- <11, 1, 0>
- <12, 2, 14>
- <13, 7, 1>
- <14, 7, 6>
