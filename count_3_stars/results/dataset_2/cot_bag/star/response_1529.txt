Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
In this graph, node 6, 9, 13, and 12 have 5 neighbors each which is the highest among all the nodes. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

There are no other nodes that have more than 3 neighbors, so we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 4, 6)>
<6, (9, 7, 6)>
<6, (13, 0, 6)>
<6, (13, 7, 6)>
<6, (13, 1, 6)>
<9, (6, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 11, 9)>
<9, (6, 0, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
<13, (5, 12, 13)>
<13, (5, 1, 13)>
<13, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (5, 0, 13)>
<13, (12, 1, 13)>
<12, (2, 13, 12)>
<12, (2, 11, 12)>
<12, (2, 4, 12)>
<12, (2, 1, 12)>
