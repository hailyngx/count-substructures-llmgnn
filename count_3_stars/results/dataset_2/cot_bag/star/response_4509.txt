Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 41 3-stars in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 10, 19>
<2, 4, 16>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 18>
<2, 10, 19>
<4, 16, 2>
<5, 6, 14>
<5, 9, 15>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 12>
<6, 18, 12>
<9, 5, 15>
<9, 15, 18>
<10, 0, 19>
<10, 2, 19>
<12, 6, 8>
<12, 8, 6>
<14, 5, 15>
<15, 9, 5>
<18, 6, 9>
