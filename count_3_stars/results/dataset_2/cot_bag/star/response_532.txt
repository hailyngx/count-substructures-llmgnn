Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 2) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (23, 13) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 24) (20, 2) (20, 11) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 7) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 21) (12, 18) (12, 6) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 19) (28, 3) (28, 14) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 17) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (7, 2) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 4) (1, 27) (1, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 21) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 4) (21, 11) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (24, 23) (24, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph and identify the nodes with their respective neighbors. Let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: {27, 29, 6}
2. Node 1: {27, 24}
3. Node 2: {9, 20, 7}
4. Node 3: {8, 28, 6, 19}
5. Node 4: {10, 25, 29, 21}
6. Node 5: {9, 16, 10}
7. Node 6: {13, 0, 12, 3, 11}
8. Node 7: {2, 10}
9. Node 8: {9, 10, 3}
10. Node 9: {5, 2, 25, 8}
11. Node 10: {5, 8, 4, 7}
12. Node 11: {20, 17, 6, 21}
13. Node 12: {18, 6}
14. Node 13: {22, 23, 6}
15. Node 14: {22, 28, 16}
16. Node 15: {19}
17. Node 16: {5, 17, 14}
18. Node 17: {26, 25, 16, 11}
19. Node 18: {27, 26, 12}
20. Node 20: {2, 11}
21. Node 21: {4, 11}
22. Node 22: {13, 23, 26, 14}
23. Node 23: {13, 22, 26, 24}
24. Node 24: {23, 1}
25. Node 25: {9, 4, 17}
26. Node 26: {22, 23, 18, 17}
27. Node 27: {0, 18, 1}
28. Node 28: {3, 14}
29. Node 29: {0, 4}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
1. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (0, 12, 3)>
<6, (0, 12, 11)>
<6, (0, 3, 11)>
<6, (3, 12, 11)>
<10, (5, 4, 7)>
<11, (20, 6, 21)>
<13, (22, 23, 6)>
<14, (22, 28, 16)>
<16, (5, 17, 14)>
<17, (26, 22, 25)>
<22, (13, 23, 14)>
<23, (13, 22, 24)>
<25, (9, 4, 17)>
<26, (22, 23, 17)>
<27, (0, 18, 1)>
