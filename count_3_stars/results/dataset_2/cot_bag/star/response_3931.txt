Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 -- 2 -- 8 -- 7 -- 3 -- 9
    |           |       |  
    5 -- 0 -- 4        6
```

There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<6, (2, 8, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 3)>
<7, (9, 1, 0)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (9, 7, 0)>
