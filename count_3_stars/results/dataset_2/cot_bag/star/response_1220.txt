Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph representation:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {6, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 4, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 0, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 3}

Next, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 3)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<4, (9, 2, 3)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<4, (9, 3, 1)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 7, 1)>
<7, (6, 2, 1)>
<7, (6, 2, 4)>
<7, (6, 4, 0)>
<7, (6, 4, 2)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<7, (2, 4, 1)>
