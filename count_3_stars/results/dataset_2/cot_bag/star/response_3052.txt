Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 4, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 5
Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

So, the total number of 3-stars within the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
