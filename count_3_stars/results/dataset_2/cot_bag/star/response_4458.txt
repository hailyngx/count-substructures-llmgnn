Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 2: {9, 3, 8, 7, 5, 11}  
Node 4: {9, 3, 7, 12}  
Node 6: {9, 14, 10, 13}  
Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 11}  
Node 10: {1, 6, 12, 0}  
Node 11: {1, 8, 2, 5}  
Node 12: {4, 7, 5, 10}  
Node 13: {6, 9, 8}  
Node 14: {6, 1, 3, 0, 5}  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Adding these up:  
\( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 55 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
