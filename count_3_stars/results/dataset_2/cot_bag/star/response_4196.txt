Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 8, 0, 14, 4, 7, 9, 2, 6.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star 
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 0 3-stars (has exactly 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed)
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 0: 2 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 2 3-stars

Total number of unique 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2]

Total: [16]
