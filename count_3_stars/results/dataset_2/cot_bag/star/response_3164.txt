Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 15) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 13) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (9, 11) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors, which we will consider as potential center nodes of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: Can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 2: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4: Can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 6: Can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 7: Can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 8: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 10: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 12: Can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 13: Can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 14: Can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 15: Can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 16: Can form 1 3-star.
14. Node 18: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 19: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 34

So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 12, 10)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 12, 10)>
<4, (18, 13, 19)>
<6, (8, 18, 17)>
<7, (2, 18, 16)>
<8, (3, 5, 2)>
<10, (12, 18, 19)>
<12, (1, 10, 3)>
<13, (4, 19, 0)>
<14, (3, 16, 15)>
<15, (0, 17, 14)>
<16, (7, 14, 15)>
<17, (6, 18, 15)>
<18, (10, 4, 19)>
<19, (18, 13, 0)>
