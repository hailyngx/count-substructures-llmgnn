Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 10), (0, 3). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 2). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 13). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 12), (9, 13). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
  
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (11, 9), (11, 8), (11, 14), (11, 3), (11, 10). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 7). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (14, 13), (14, 4), (14, 11), (14, 1). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 74 \)

So we found a total of 74 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [74]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
