Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
