Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: There are 5 neighbors - 6, 8, 3, 1, 9. The number of 3-stars formed with node 0 as the center node is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 2: There are 4 neighbors - 6, 9, 8, 5. The number of 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3: There are 5 neighbors - 9, 4, 8, 5, 0. The number of 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center node is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4: There are 4 neighbors - 9, 7, 1, 3. The number of 3-stars formed with node 4 as the center node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 6: There are 4 neighbors - 9, 7, 2, 0. The number of 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7: There are 4 neighbors - 6, 4, 1, 7. The number of 3-stars formed with node 7 as the center node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9: There are 5 neighbors - 6, 4, 2, 3, 0. The number of 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center node is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 46.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 3>, 
<0, 3, 5>, 
<0, 3, 8>, 
<0, 3, 9>, 
<0, 6, 7>, 
<0, 6, 9>, 
<2, 5, 8>, 
<2, 6, 9>, 
<2, 9, 8>, 
<3, 4, 9>, 
<3, 5, 9>, 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<6, 7, 9>.
