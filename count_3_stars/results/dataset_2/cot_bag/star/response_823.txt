Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we will go through each node and check if it has three or more neighbors, forming a 3-star.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 15, 13), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 18), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 13, 5), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 16), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors (10, 14, 19, 0, 12), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors (10, 11, 18), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors (9, 7, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors (11, 4, 17), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors (13, 2, 14), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors (11, 2, 17), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (1, 13, 7, 16, 19), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors (15, 0, 19), so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each applicable node, we get a total of 25 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
