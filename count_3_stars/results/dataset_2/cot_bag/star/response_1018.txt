Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 24) (8, 3) (8, 9) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 29) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 7) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 29) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 16) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 23) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (6, 7) (21, 18) (21, 23) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 19) (2, 5) (22, 19) (22, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (24, 19) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 21) (14, 12) (29, 0) (29, 4) (29, 18) (29, 22) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (17, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (16, 26) (16, 10) (27, 10) (10, 4) (10, 16) (10, 27) 

Response:
The node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 11, and 25. So, it can form 1 3-star.   
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.   
Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 25, 15, and 4. So, it can form 1 3-star.   
Node 25 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.   
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.  
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 0 also has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.   
Node 15 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.   
Node 18 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 19 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 26 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.   
Node 7 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.  
Node 12 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.   
Node 6 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.  
Node 21 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 2 also has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.  
Node 22 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 24 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.  
Node 23 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.   
Node 14 has 1 neighbor and cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 29 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 17 has 1 neighbor and cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 28 has 4 neighbors and can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 16 has 2 neighbors and cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 27 has 1 neighbor and cannot form any 3-star.  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:   
1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 70

Hence, there are 70 3-stars in the given graph.  

Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<1, (3, 11, 25)>, <3, (1, 0, 24)>, <3, (25, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 28, 15)>, <3, (13, 5, 11)>, <3, (13, 23, 25)>, <0, (3, 15, 29)>, <4, (20, 10, 17)>, <18, (25, 21, 29)>, <19, (26, 2, 24)>, <26, (19, 23, 5)>, <7, (15, 6, 9)>, <12, (28, 14, 11)>, <5, (13, 2, 26)>, <6, (7, 9, 15)>, <9, (8, 7, 28)>, <2, (19, 5, 26)>, <24, (3, 25, 19)>, <23, (13, 26, 12)>, <29, (0, 18, 22)>, <11, (1, 13, 12)>, <28, (0, 12, 9)>.

Therefore, there are 21 unique 3-stars in the graph.
