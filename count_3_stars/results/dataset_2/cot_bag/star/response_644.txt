Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will go through each node that has three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars formed. 

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 4, 14, 3. This node can form 4 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 11, 8, 14. This node can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 12, 0, 9. This node can form 10 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 13, 0, 6, 3. This node can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 10, 14. This node can form 10 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 10, 12, 2. This node can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 11, 3, 7. This node can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 1, 13. This node can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 12 has 6 neighbors: 7, 13, 14, 3, 1, 8. This node can form 15 3-stars.
10. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 11, 12, 14. This node can form 10 3-stars.
11. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 12, 2, 0, 6, 13. This node can form 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of [59] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
