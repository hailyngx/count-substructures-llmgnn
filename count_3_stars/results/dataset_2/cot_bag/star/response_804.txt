Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the following based on the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 1 neighbor
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 1 neighbor
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15 can form \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17 can form \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 can form \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19 can form \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<2, (3, 4, 13)>
<2, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 13)>
<4, (2, 3, 13)>
<5, (3, 13, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 17)>
<8, (17, 19, 8)>
<9, (4, 0, 9)>
<12, (1, 9, 12)>
<15, (0, 9, 15)>
<17, (5, 8, 17)>
<18, (0, 11, 18)>
<19, (8, 17, 19)>
