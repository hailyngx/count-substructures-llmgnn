Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Considering each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: 
Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 0. 
<0, (1, 3, 9)> 
<0, (1, 2, 3)> 
<0, (1, 2, 9)> 
<0, (3, 9, 4)>

For node 1: 
Since node 1 has 5 neighbors, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 1. 
<1, (0, 3, 4)> 
<1, (0, 3, 6)> 
<1, (0, 3, 9)> 
<1, (0, 4, 6)> 
<1, (0, 4, 5)> 
<1, (3, 4, 6)> 
<1, (3, 4, 9)> 
<1, (4, 5, 6)> 
<1, (4, 5, 5)> 
<1, (4, 6, 5)>

For node 3: 
Since node 3 has 4 neighbors, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 3. 
<3, (0, 1, 4)> 
<3, (0, 1, 9)> 
<3, (1, 4, 6)> 
<3, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 4: 
Since node 4 has 5 neighbors, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 4. 
<4, (0, 1, 3)> 
<4, (0, 1, 6)> 
<4, (0, 3, 6)> 
<4, (0, 3, 7)> 
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)> 
<4, (6, 7, 1)>

For node 5: 
Since node 5 has 6 neighbors, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars with node 5. 
<5, (1, 2, 8)> 
<5, (1, 8, 6)> 
<5, (2, 8, 7)> 
<5, (4, 7, 6)> 
<5, (0, 9, 1)> 
<5, (0, 2, 6)> 
<5, (0, 2, 8)> 
<5, (0, 6, 8)> 
<5, (0, 2, 7)> 
<5, (0, 6, 7)> 
<5, (0, 1, 4)> 
<5, (0, 3, 6)> 
<5, (0, 3, 8)> 
<5, (0, 1, 3)> 
<5, (0, 4, 6)> 
<5, (0, 4, 7)> 
<5, (0, 1, 3)> 
<5, (0, 1, 9)> 
<5, (0, 9, 4)> 
<5, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 9: 
Since node 9 has 5 neighbors, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 9. 
<9, (0, 1, 3)> 
<9, (0, 3, 4)> 
<9, (0, 3, 7)> 
<9, (0, 4, 7)> 
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)> 
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 0)> 
<9, (1, 4, 0)> 
<9, (3, 4, 0)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 68 3-stars in this graph: [68].  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (3, 9, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 9, 1)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 9, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 0)>, <9, (3, 4, 0)>
