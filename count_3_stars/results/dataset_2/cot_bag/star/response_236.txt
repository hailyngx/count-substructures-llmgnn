Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (18, 16) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (5, 7) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 9) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (11, 15) (11, 13) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

For each such node, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it contributes to. Let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (12, 9, 13, 10). So, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (6, 19, 7). So, it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (15, 1, 14). So, it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (9, 1, 16). So, it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors: (12, 10, 0, 11, 16). So, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (18, 4, 15, 9). So, it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (12, 4, 8, 6). So, it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (17, 7, 8, 1). So, it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (14, 4, 19, 0, 16). So, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (2, 5, 8). So, it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding up the contributions from these nodes: 

\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 40 \)

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list those 3-stars:
