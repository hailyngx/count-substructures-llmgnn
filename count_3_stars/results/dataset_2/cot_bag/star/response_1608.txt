Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 9) (3, 19) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 2) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 16) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 11) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 6) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 24) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (25, 21) (27, 28) (27, 21) (27, 18) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 20) (5, 22) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 21) (10, 7) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 29) (24, 17) (24, 15) (24, 4) (18, 27) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (4, 16) (4, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 15) (12, 14) (12, 28) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 5) (29, 22) (29, 14) (29, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in the graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets: [45]

The unique 3-stars found are:
