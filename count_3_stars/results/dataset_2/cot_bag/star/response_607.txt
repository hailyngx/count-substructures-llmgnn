Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars connected to each of these nodes.

1. Node 2: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 14)
2. Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 14)
3. Node 8: 4 neighbors (2, 11, 18, 19)
4. Node 12: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 11, 15)
5. Node 15: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 10, 12)
6. Node 16: 4 neighbors (7, 10, 19, 18)
7. Node 18: 5 neighbors (3, 6, 8, 14, 16)
8. Node 19: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 16)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 14)>
<5, (0, 6, 14)>
<8, (2, 11, 18)>
<12, (1, 6, 15)>
<15, (1, 3, 10)>
<16, (7, 10, 19)>
<18, (3, 6, 14)>
