Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 16) (15, 8) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 14) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 7) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 19) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graph can be constructed as follows:

1. Node 5: 
   - Neighbors: 3, 9, 16
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 9, 16)>

2. Node 9:
   - Neighbors: 5, 14
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

3. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 3, 16
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

4. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 11, 16
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 8, 16)>, <3, (5, 8, 16)>, <3, (8, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 5, 16)>, <3, (5, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>

5. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 3, 12, 13, 15
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (3, 13, 15)>, <8, (3, 12, 15)>, <8, (3, 12, 13)>, <8, (12, 13, 15)>

6. Node 13:
   - Neighbors: 8, 10, 19
   - Number of 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Unique 3-stars: <13, (8, 10, 19)>

7. Node 4, Node 2, Node 18, Node 10, Node 16, Node 19, Node 6, Node 17, Node 0, Node 7, Node 12:
   - These nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 16. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (3, 9, 16)>, <3, (1, 8, 16)>, <3, (5, 8, 16)>, <3, (8, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 5, 16)>, <3, (5, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 11, 16)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>, <8, (3, 13, 15)>, <8, (3, 12, 15)>, <8, (3, 12, 13)>, <8, (12, 13, 15)>, <13, (8, 10, 19)>.
