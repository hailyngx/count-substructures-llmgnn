Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it can form and then sum up these counts to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the provided edges, we can see the following neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 8, 10)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (2, 4, 12, 15, 19)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 13)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (9, 17, 18)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (7, 15, 19)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (1, 8, 0)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors (0, 16, 17, 19)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 10, 14)
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 9, 13, 14)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 33 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 8, 10)>
- <5, (2, 4, 19)>
- <6, (1, 4, 13)>
- <7, (9, 17, 18)>
- <9, (7, 15, 19)>
- <11, (1, 8, 0)>
- <14, (0, 16, 19)>
- <16, (2, 4, 10)>
- <19, (2, 5, 13)>
