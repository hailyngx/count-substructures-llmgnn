Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The graph described has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 6, 2, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 2, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 8, 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 2, 1, 7.

Now we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 and Node 9 each have 6 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and Node 7 each have 5 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 and Node 4 each have 4 neighbors, so they each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 each have fewer than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 68 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
These are the only unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph.
