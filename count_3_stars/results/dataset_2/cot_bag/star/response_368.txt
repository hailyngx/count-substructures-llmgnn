Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 28) (11, 22) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 1) (22, 11) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 22) (23, 24) (5, 14) (5, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 15) (26, 7) (26, 16) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (20, 5) (20, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (24, 6) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 27) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 26) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 8) (8, 21) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

First, let's determine the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 13, 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[ [13 \times 4 + 2 \times 1] = [52 + 2] = [54] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 10, 23)>, <1, (3, 9, 22)>, <1, (10, 13, 23)>, <1, (10, 18, 22)>, 
<4, (2, 15, 27)>, <4, (15, 18, 19)>, <4, (18, 19, 20)>, <4, (18, 19, 4)>, 
<6, (17, 21, 24)>, <6, (17, 24, 27)>, <6, (21, 24, 27)>, <6, (6, 17, 24)>, 
<8, (21, 24, 25)>, <8, (21, 8, 12)>, <8, (8, 12, 25)>, <8, (12, 25, 28)>, <8, (12, 25, 8)>, 
<9, (15, 21, 6)>, <9, (15, 19, 4)>, <9, (21, 6, 24)>, <9, (3, 9, 22)>, 
<13, (7, 10, 13)>, 
<14, (0, 8, 14)>, <14, (14, 0, 8)>, 
<15, (4, 15, 19)>, <15, (4, 15, 9)>, <15, (4, 15, 19)>, <15, (9, 15, 21)>, 
<18, (10, 18, 20)>, <18, (10, 13, 18)>, <18, (18, 20, 13)>, <18, (13, 18, 10)>, 
<21, (21, 7, 26)>, <21, (21, 8, 29)>, <21, (21, 15, 29)>, <21, (21, 6, 24)>, <21, (21, 7, 8)>, 
<22, (1, 22, 23)>, <22, (1, 22, 23)>, <23, (1, 22, 23)>, <23, (1, 10, 22)>, 
<24, (6, 17, 24)>, <24, (6, 21, 24)>, <24, (6, 24, 27)>, <24, (24, 8, 25)>, 
<28, (0, 12, 28)>, <28, (0, 12, 28)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [54], and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
