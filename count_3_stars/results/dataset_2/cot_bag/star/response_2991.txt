Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Counting up the total number of 3-stars gives us \([1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1]\), which simplifies to \([54]\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 54.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
