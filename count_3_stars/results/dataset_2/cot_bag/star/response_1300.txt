Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Following the combinatorial calculation for each node:
- Node 0 contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes 3 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 contributes 3 3-stars.
- Node 20 contributes 3 3-stars.
- Node 21 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 22 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 25 contributes 2 3-stars.
- Node 26 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 27 contributes 5 3-stars.
- Node 29 contributes 1 3-star.

Summing up all the contributions: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 39.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (6, 18, 16)>
<3, (25, 11, 17)>
<4, (22, 18, 15)>
<8, (9, 5, 23)>
<9, (25, 8, 20)>
