Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three edges, which means they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's identify these nodes and calculate the number of unique 3-stars they form:

1. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 5, 1, 11, 0, 4, 3 (itself)
   - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <3, 5, 1, 11>, 
        - <3, 5, 0, 4>, 
        - <3, 5, 1, 4>, 
        - <3, 1, 11, 0>, 
        - <3, 11, 0, 4>
        - <3, 5, 11, 0>

2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 11, 13, 12, 14
   - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <4, 3, 11, 13>
        - <4, 3, 11, 14>
        - <4, 3, 13, 14>
        - <4, 11, 13, 12>
        - <4, 11, 13, 14>

3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 13, 14, 7, 6, 1
   - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <8, 13, 14, 7>
        - <8, 13, 14, 1>
        - <8, 13, 7, 6>
        - <8, 14, 7, 6>
        - <8, 14, 7, 1>

4. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 12
   - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 1
   - Unique 3-stars: <9, 5, 7, 12>

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 41
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
