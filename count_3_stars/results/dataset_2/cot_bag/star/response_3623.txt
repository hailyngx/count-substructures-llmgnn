Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 2, 3, 5, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 7:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

For node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is \( [46] \) and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
