Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: 1
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 11, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<0, (10, 5, 12)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 5, 3)>
<2, (7, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<6, (7, 13, 8)>
<7, (13, 4, 8)>
<7, (13, 9, 6)>
<8, (13, 4, 6)>
<10, (5, 0, 12)>
<12, (4, 14, 8)>
<13, (4, 8, 6)>
<14, (7, 8, 4)>
