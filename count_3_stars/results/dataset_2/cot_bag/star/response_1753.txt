Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors 9, 4, 2
- Node 1: Neighbors 7, 3, 2
- Node 2: Neighbors 5, 4, 7, 1, 0
- Node 3: Neighbors 5, 9, 6, 7, 1
- Node 4: Neighbors 6, 7, 0, 2
- Node 5: Neighbors 9, 2, 8, 3
- Node 6: Neighbors 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors 4, 3, 2, 1, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors 5, 9, 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors 5, 9, 8, 3, 0

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
