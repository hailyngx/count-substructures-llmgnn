Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 18) (13, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 9) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 16, and 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
- For nodes 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, and 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Summing these up: 
\( 9 \times 1 + 6 \times 4 = 9 + 24 = 33 \)

So, there are 33 3-stars in total, which gives us [33].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 13, 19)>, <3, (2, 4, 16)>, <4, (3, 6, 14)>, <5, (0, 1, 17)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 11, 19)>, <10, (6, 14, 17)>, <11, (7, 14, 16)>, <12, (2, 16, 18)>, <14, (4, 10, 11)>, <15, (2, 16, 18)>, <16, (3, 11, 15)>, <17, (5, 10, 14)>, <18, (6, 12, 15)>, <19, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [33].
