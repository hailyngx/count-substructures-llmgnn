Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (17, 5) (17, 19) (19, 13) (19, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (1, 12, 14)>, <0, (1, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 12, 14)>, <0, (6, 12, 14)>
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <1, (0, 11, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 11)>, <1, (9, 10, 11)>
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star. <4, (7, 12, 16)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 13, 18)>, <5, (14, 17, 18)>, <5, (13, 17, 19)>, <5, (13, 17, 19)>
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star. <7, (2, 6, 12)>
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <9, (1, 10, 11)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (10, 11, 14)>, <9, (10, 11, 1)>
- Node 10: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star. <10, (11, 18, 9)>
- Node 11: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <11, (9, 13, 14)>, <11, (1, 10, 13)>, <11, (9, 10, 14)>, <11, (1, 9, 10)>, <11, (1, 13, 14)>, <11, (9, 13, 10)>, <11, (13, 14, 18)>, <11, (9, 14, 18)>, <11, (1, 14, 18)>, <11, (10, 14, 18)>
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <12, (0, 2, 14)>, <12, (4, 2, 7)>, <12, (0, 3, 4)>, <12, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 13: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star. <13, (11, 5, 19)>
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <14, (0, 11, 9)>, <14, (0, 3, 12)>, <14, (0, 9, 11)>, <14, (3, 9, 12)>
- Node 15: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 16: has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star. <16, (4, 15, 18)>
- Node 18: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <18, (5, 10, 16)>, <18, (5, 15, 17)>, <18, (5, 16, 17)>, <18, (10, 15, 16)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [37].     
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 12, 14)>, <0, (1, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 12, 14)>, <0, (6, 12, 14)>, <1, (0, 11, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 11)>, <1, (9, 10, 11)>, <4, (7, 12, 16)>, <5, (1, 13, 18)>, <5, (14, 17, 18)>, <5, (13, 17, 19)>, <7, (2, 6, 12)>, <9, (1, 10, 11)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (10, 11, 14)>, <9, (10, 11, 1)>, <10, (11, 18, 9)>, <11, (9, 13, 14)>, <11, (1, 10, 13)>, <11, (9, 10, 14)>, <11, (1, 9, 10)>, <11, (1, 13, 14)>, <11, (9, 13, 10)>, <11, (13, 14, 18)>, <11, (9, 14, 18)>, <11, (1, 14, 18)>, <11, (10, 14, 18)>, <12, (0, 2, 14)>, <12, (4, 2, 7)>, <12, (0, 3, 4)>, <12, (2, 3, 7)>, <13, (11, 5, 19)>, <14, (0, 11, 9)>, <14, (0, 3, 12)>, <14, (0, 9, 11)>, <14, (3, 9, 12)>, <16, (4, 15, 18)>, <18, (5, 10, 16)>, <18, (5, 15, 17)>, <18, (5, 16, 17)>, <18, (10, 15, 16)>.
