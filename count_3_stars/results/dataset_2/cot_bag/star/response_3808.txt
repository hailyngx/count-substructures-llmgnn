Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all these, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 83 \).

So, the final answer is [83].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 7, 10>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 11, 14>, <2, 7, 12>, <3, 8, 14>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 12>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 10, 11>, <5, 12, 14>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 11, 14>, <10, 11, 14>, <12, 13, 14>
