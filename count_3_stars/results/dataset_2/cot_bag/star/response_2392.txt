Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Let's begin by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 8}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars around each relevant node:

- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing these results: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 59 

Therefore, there are 59 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>
