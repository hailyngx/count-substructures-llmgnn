The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (20, 2) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 6) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 14) (18, 23) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 0) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 11) (15, 26) (15, 12) (7, 1) (7, 24) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 22) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 5) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 2) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 27) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 13) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 24) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 22) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 11) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 24) (27, 13) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 27) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 26, 5. So there is 1 3-star with Node 0.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 22, 7. So there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with Node 1.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 20, 16, 21. So there is 1 3-star with Node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 29, 17, 10. So there are 4 3-stars with Node 3.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 12, 16, 0, 24. So there are 4 3-stars with Node 5.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 28, 10, 0. So there are 4 3-stars with Node 6.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 19, 17, 22. So there are 4 3-stars with Node 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 1. So there is 1 3-star with Node 9.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 6, 3, 19, 13. So there are 4 3-stars with Node 10.

Other nodes have either less than 3 neighbors or exactly 2 neighbors, so no additional 3-stars are formed with them.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 26, 5)>, <1, (9, 3, 22)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 22, 7)>, <3, (1, 29, 17)>, <3, (1, 17, 10)>, <3, (1, 29, 10)>, <3, (29, 17, 10)>, <5, (12, 16, 0)>, <5, (12, 16, 24)>, <5, (12, 0, 24)>, <5, (16, 0, 24)>, <6, (9, 28, 10)>, <6, (9, 28, 0)>, <6, (9, 10, 0)>, <6, (28, 10, 0)>, <8, (9, 19, 17)>, <8, (9, 19, 22)>, <8, (9, 17, 22)>, <8, (19, 17, 22)>, <10, (6, 3, 19)>, <10, (6, 3, 13)>, <10, (6, 19, 13)>, <10, (3, 19, 13)>.

These are all the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
