Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as those are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56

Putting the final count inside brackets: [56]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 0, 3)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>
