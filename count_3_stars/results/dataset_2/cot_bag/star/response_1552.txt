Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 4, 8, 5, 6, 2, 13, 12, 0, 14, 7.

- For node 1: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (5, 13, 7)>, <1, (5, 13, 14)>, <1, (5, 7, 14)>, <1, (13, 7, 14)>

- For node 3: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 14, 6)>, <3, (0, 14, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (14, 6, 9)>

- For node 10: there are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
<10, (11, 12, 0)>

- For node 11: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<11, (10, 8, 4)>, <11, (10, 8, 2)>, <11, (10, 4, 2)>, <11, (8, 4, 2)>

- For node 4: there are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
<4, (11, 8, 12)>

- For node 8: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<8, (11, 4, 6)>, <8, (11, 4, 7)>, <8, (11, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

- For node 5: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<5, (1, 6, 13)>, <5, (1, 6, 12)>, <5, (1, 13, 12)>, <5, (6, 13, 12)>

- For node 6: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (3, 8, 14)>, <6, (3, 8, 5)>, <6, (3, 14, 5)>, <6, (8, 14, 5)>

- For node 2: there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (11, 13, 7)>, <2, (11, 13, 0)>, <2, (11, 7, 0)>, <2, (13, 7, 0)>

- For node 13: there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<13, (1, 7, 12)>, <13, (1, 7, 5)>, <13, (1, 12, 5)>, <13, (7, 12, 5)>, <13, (1, 2, 12)>, <13, (1, 2, 7)>, <13, (1, 12, 7)>, <13, (2, 12, 7)>, <13, (2, 12, 5)>, <13, (2, 7, 5)>

- For node 12: there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<12, (10, 13, 14)>, <12, (10, 13, 5)>, <12, (10, 14, 5)>, <12, (13, 14, 5)>, <12, (10, 4, 13)>, <12, (10, 4, 5)>, <12, (10, 13, 5)>, <12, (4, 13, 5)>, <12, (4, 13, 14)>, <12, (4, 5, 14)>

- For node 0: there are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
<0, (3, 10, 2)>

- For node 14: there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<14, (1, 3, 6)>, <14, (1, 3, 7)>, <14, (1, 6, 7)>, <14, (3, 6, 7)>, <14, (1, 7, 9)>, <14, (1, 7, 13)>, <14, (1, 9, 13)>, <14, (7, 9, 13)>, <14, (1, 6, 9)>, <14, (1, 6, 13)>

- For node 7: there are 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<7, (1, 8, 14)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 14, 9)>, <7, (8, 14, 9)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <7, (1, 13, 2)>, <7, (1, 14, 2)>, <7, (13, 14, 2)>, <7, (1, 13, 9)>, <7, (1, 13, 12)>, <7, (1, 9, 12)>, <7, (13, 9, 12)>, <7, (8, 4, 9)>, <7, (8, 4, 12)>, <7, (8, 9, 12)>, <7, (4, 9, 12)>, <7, (8, 14, 12)>, <7, (8, 14, 6)>, <7, (8, 12, 6)>, <7, (14, 12, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of [72].
