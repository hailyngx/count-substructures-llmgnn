Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 11}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: 0
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 14: 0

Adding these up: 4+4+4+4+4+4+20+20+10+20+4+1 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 10, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (3, 9, 7)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
<4, (10, 0, 13)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 12, 10)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 11, 3)>
<10, (4, 7, 0)>
<11, (1, 9, 14)>
<12, (8, 11, 13)>
<13, (12, 11, 4)>
