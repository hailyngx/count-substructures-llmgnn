Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 5) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 5) (29, 16) (29, 3) (7, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 24) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 21) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 6) (1, 28) (1, 13) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 14) (21, 4) (21, 9) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 28) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (6, 4) (6, 27) (6, 3) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 13) (23, 25) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 25) (0, 11) (0, 22) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 28) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 
No 3-stars can be formed with this node.

Node 3:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed:
<3, (6, 9, 11)>, <3, (6, 9, 28)>, <3, (6, 11, 28)>, <3, (9, 11, 28)>.

Node 4:
\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 5:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 9:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed:
<9, (14, 19, 28)>, <9, (14, 19, 25)>, <9, (14, 28, 25)>, <9, (19, 28, 25)>.

Node 11:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 15:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed:
<15, (14, 19, 20)>.

Node 16:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed:
<16, (2, 17, 29)>, <16, (17, 29, 2)>, <16, (17, 2, 16)>, <16, (17, 29, 3)>.

Node 17:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 18:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 19:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 22:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed:
<22, (0, 8, 27)>, <22, (0, 8, 22)>, <22, (0, 8, 22)>, <22, (0, 8, 27)>.

Node 25:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 28:
\( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Node 29:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed:
<29, (3, 16, 29)>.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 0 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 104 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [104]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (6, 9, 11)>, <3, (6, 9, 28)>, <3, (6, 11, 28)>, <3, (9, 11, 28)>, <4, (6, 21, 27)>, <4, (6, 22, 27)>, <4, (11, 18, 22)>, <4, (11, 18, 27)>, <5, (12, 17, 20)>, <9, (14, 19, 25)>, <9, (14, 19, 28)>, <9, (14, 28, 25)>, <11, (0, 22, 4)>, <11, (0, 22, 27)>, <11, (18, 19, 28)>, <11, (18, 20, 28)>, <15, (14, 19, 20)>, <16, (2, 17, 29)>, <17, (10, 16, 17)>, <17, (10, 16, 20)>, <18, (11, 13, 18)>, <19, (15, 19, 25)>.

This concludes the analysis of the 3-stars in the given graph.
