Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 21) (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 24) (1, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 11) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 7) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 29) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 18) (10, 18) (10, 23) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 27) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (8, 15) (8, 1) (8, 28) (8, 26) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 12) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 4) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 20) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 2) (4, 9) (4, 2) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 18) (20, 14) (20, 18) (20, 5) (12, 14) (12, 24) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 20) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( {8 \choose 3} = 56 \)
- Node 2: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( {2 \choose 3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( {2 \choose 3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( {2 \choose 3} = 0 \)
- Node 14: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 113 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is [113].
Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<1, (3, 8, 24)>, <1, (8, 15, 28)>, <1, (8, 24, 14)>, <1, (8, 24, 1)>, <1, (15, 28, 16)>, <1, (15, 28, 8)>, <1, (24, 14, 12)>, <1, (24, 14, 20)>, <2, (4, 9, 27)>, <5, (3, 15, 8)>, <5, (15, 17, 5)>, <5, (15, 17, 11)>, <5, (15, 17, 29)>, <5, (15, 17, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 29)>, <7, (6, 9, 27)>, <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 27)>, <7, (6, 9, 29)>, <7, (14, 24, 1)>, <7, (14, 24, 14)>, <7, (14, 24, 12)>, <7, (14, 24, 20)>, <7, (25, 16, 28)>, <7, (25, 16, 19)>, <7, (25, 16, 25)>, <7, (25, 16, 25)>, <7, (25, 26, 8)>, <7, (25, 26, 25)>, <7, (25, 26, 25)>, <7, (25, 26, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 15)>, <8, (1, 3, 15)>, <8, (1, 24, 14)>, <8, (1, 24, 14)>, <8, (1, 24, 20)>, <8, (1, 24, 20)>, <8, (1, 24, 1)>, <8, (1, 24, 1)>, <8, (1, 24, 14)>, <8, (1, 24, 14)>, <8, (26,...
