Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (15, 11) (15, 13) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 5) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the results, we get a total of 40 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is: [40]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 16, 18)>, <0, (2, 6, 18)>, <0, (5, 18, 16)>, <0, (5, 1, 16)>, <1, (5, 13, 16)>, <2, (4, 12, 0)>, <3, (4, 11, 10)>, <4, (7, 2, 3)>, <4, (7, 17, 3)>, <4, (7, 2, 17)>, <4, (7, 17, 2)>, <4, (3, 2, 17)>, <5, (7, 14, 18)>, <6, (4, 0, 17)>, <6, (11, 14, 17)>, <6, (5, 14, 13)>, <7, (8, 4, 5)>, <13, (1, 15, 14)>, <14, (6, 13, 11)>, <17, (4, 6, 11)>
