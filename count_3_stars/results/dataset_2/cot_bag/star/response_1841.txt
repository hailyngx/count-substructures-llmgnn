Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 15: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 16: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 19: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 20: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 21: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 28: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 29: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (4, 7, 11, 24)>  
<5, (19, 20, 24, 28)>
