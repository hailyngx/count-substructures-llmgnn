Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 15) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 9) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 15) (9, 17) (9, 19) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 6) (18, 8) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 16}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 14, 16, 19}
- Node 2: {6, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {8, 11, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 12, 15}
- Node 7: {13, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 18}
- Node 9: {17, 19}
- Node 10: {5}
- Node 11: {4, 15, 19}
- Node 12: {6}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 17}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 17}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 16: {0, 1, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 18: {8, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 9, 11}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only one 3-star forming node)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 28 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
< 1, (0, 5, 16) >, 
< 4, (2, 6, 15) >, 
< 5, (0, 8, 10) >, 
< 6, (2, 3, 12) >, 
< 7, (13, 14, 17) >, 
< 8, (4, 5, 18) >, 
< 11, (4, 15, 19) >, 
< 15, (2, 4, 6) >, 
< 17, (2, 7, 13) >.
