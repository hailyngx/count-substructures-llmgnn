Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the given graph that have three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

For node 0: There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars associated with node 0.

For node 4: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 4.

For node 5: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars associated with node 5.

For node 6: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 6.

For node 7: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars associated with node 7.

For node 9: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars associated with node 9.

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
