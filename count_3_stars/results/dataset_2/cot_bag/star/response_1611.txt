Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 27) (22, 4) (22, 11) (27, 13) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 23) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 0) (28, 4) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 19) (3, 6) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 12) (21, 3) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 29) (16, 14) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (26, 23) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 23) (17, 26) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 20) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 1) (20, 12) (20, 7) (20, 11) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 14) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 25) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 12 with 5 neighbors, node 13 with 4 neighbors, and node 7 with 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

1. For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <12, (27, 7, 21)>, <12, (27, 7, 20)>, <12, (27, 21, 3)>, <12, (27, 21, 3)>, <12, (7, 21, 3)>

2. For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <13, (10, 19, 0)>

3. For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <7, (12, 16, 21)>, <7, (12, 16, 29)>, <7, (12, 21, 3)>, <7, (12, 21, 3)>, <7, (16, 21, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars is [24].
