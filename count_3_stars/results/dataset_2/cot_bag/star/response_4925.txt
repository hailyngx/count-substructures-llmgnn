Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 9) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 25) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 9) (20, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 26) (15, 10) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 3) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (25, 28) (25, 23) (27, 7) (27, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (24, 6) (24, 2) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 24) (1, 12) (1, 27) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (18, 17) (18, 23) (18, 3) (23, 25) (23, 18) (23, 4) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 10) (4, 23) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 11, 16, 7, 12, 14, 9, 26, 17, 20, 10, 15, 29, 8, 19, 2, 13, 24, 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<11, 5, 17> 
<16, 9, 22> 
<7, 14, 0> 
<7, 14, 11> 
<7, 21, 8> 
<7, 21, 12> 
<12, 1, 27> 
<12, 3, 29> 
<12, 13, 19> 
<12, 2, 24> 
<14, 7, 0> 
<14, 7, 11> 
<9, 16, 22> 
<9, 4, 20> 
<26, 15, 10> 
<17, 20, 9> 
<20, 9, 4> 
<10, 2, 24> 
<15, 10, 26> 
<29, 3, 6> 
<8, 6, 21> 
<19, 2, 13> 

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
