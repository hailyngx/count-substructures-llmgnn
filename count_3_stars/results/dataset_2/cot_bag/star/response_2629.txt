This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 29) (26, 10) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (15, 5) (15, 26) (16, 9) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 12) (23, 12) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 20) (13, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 21) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 25) (3, 17) (3, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (29, 25) (29, 10) (29, 24) (14, 8) (14, 21) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 23) (21, 22) (21, 14) (21, 27) (27, 17) (27, 21) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 18) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 8) (11, 18) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 17, 25, 26, 8, 13, 4, and 22.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (9, 2, 18, 22, 15)
   Number of 3-stars from node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (9, 2, 18)>, <5, (9, 2, 22)>, <5, (9, 2, 15)>, <5, (9, 18, 22)>, <5, (9, 18, 15)>, <5, (9, 22, 15)>, <5, (2, 18, 22)>, <5, (2, 18, 15)>, <5, (2, 22, 15)>, <5, (18, 22, 15)>

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (5, 16, 19)
   Number of 3-stars from node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (5, 16, 19)>

3. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (17, 26, 12, 4, 29)
   Number of 3-stars from node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <10, (17, 26, 12)>, <10, (17, 26, 4)>, <10, (17, 26, 29)>, <10, (17, 12, 4)>, <10, (17, 12, 29)>, <10, (17, 4, 29)>, <10, (26, 12, 4)>, <10, (26, 12, 29)>, <10, (26, 4, 29)>, <10, (12, 4, 29)>

4. Node 17 has 5 neighbors: (10, 13, 3, 27, 4)
   Number of 3-stars from node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <17, (10, 13, 3)>, <17, (10, 13, 27)>, <17, (10, 13, 4)>, <17, (10, 3, 27)>, <17, (10, 3, 4)>, <17, (10, 27, 4)>, <17, (13, 3, 27)>, <17, (13, 3, 4)>, <17, (13, 27, 4)>, <17, (3, 27, 4)>

5. Node 25 has 5 neighbors: (8, 29, 28, 2, 26)
   Number of 3-stars from node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <25, (8, 29, 28)>, <25, (8, 29, 2)>, <25, (8, 29, 26)>, <25, (8, 28, 2)>, <25, (8, 28, 26)>, <25, (8, 2, 26)>, <25, (29, 28, 2)>, <25, (29, 28, 26)>, <25, (29, 2, 26)>, <25, (28, 2, 26)>

6. Node 26 has 5 neighbors: (10, 24, 15, 11, 0)
   Number of 3-stars from node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <26, (10, 24, 15)>, <26, (10, 24, 11)>, <26, (10, 24, 0)>, <26, (10, 15, 11)>, <26, (10, 15, 0)>, <26, (10, 11, 0)>, <26, (24, 15, 11)>, <26, (24, 15, 0)>, <26, (24, 11, 0)>, <26, (15, 11, 0)>

7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (25, 19, 14, 11, 7)
   Number of 3-stars from node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <8, (25, 19, 14)>, <8, (25, 19, 11)>, <8, (25, 19, 7)>, <8, (25, 14, 11)>, <8, (25, 14, 7)>, <8, (25, 11, 7)>, <8, (19, 14, 11)>, <8, (19, 14, 7)>, <8, (19, 11, 7)>, <8, (14, 11, 7)>

8. Node 13 has 2 neighbors: (20, 17)
   Number of 3-stars from node 13: 0

9. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (10, 17, 22)
   Number of 3-stars from node 4: 1
   <4, (10, 17, 22)>

10. Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (5, 4, 21)
    Number of 3-stars from node 22: 1
    <22, (5, 4, 21)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 56
So, there are a total of [56] unique 3-stars in the graph.
