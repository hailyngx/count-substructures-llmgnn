Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are the potential central nodes for the 3-star graphs.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 5, 2, and 0.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 8, 3)>, 
  <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 1)>, <9, (2, 8, 3)>, <9, (3, 8, 1)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>

- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <1, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>

- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>,
  <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>

- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>,
  <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 2)>

- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (0, 4, 6)>

- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <0, (1, 5, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 45\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 45.
