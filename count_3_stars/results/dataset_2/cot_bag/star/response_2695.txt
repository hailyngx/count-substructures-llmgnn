Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 3) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 0) (15, 20) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 27) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 14) (26, 2) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 21) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 22) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 17) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 14) (23, 20) (23, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 16) (22, 12) (22, 1) (10, 27) (27, 6) (27, 28) (27, 11) (27, 10) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 22) (16, 3) (16, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 20, 25, 26, and 27. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 20 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
10. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, thus \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 77 \]

So, there are 77 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this number inside brackets: [77].
