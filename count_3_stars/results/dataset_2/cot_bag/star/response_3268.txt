Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors.

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 4, 0, 3
    - Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 5: <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>

2. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 4, 1
    - Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>

3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 8
    - Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 6: <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>

4. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 2, 4, 7
    - Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 1: <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 2, 4)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>

5. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 7, 2
    - Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 3: <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>

6. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 8
    - Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>

7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 0
    - Unique 3-stars at node 7: <7, (1, 3, 0)>

8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 4, 2
    - Number of 3-stars at node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars at node 8: <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 2)>

9. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
    - Unique 3-stars at node 2: <2, (1, 3, 8)>

10. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7
    - No 3-stars are formed at node 0.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 54\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].
