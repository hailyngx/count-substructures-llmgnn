Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (15, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 19) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. Then we'll count the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 8, 13, 2, 18, 7, 12, 1, 17, 19, 10, 15, 4, 0, 11, 3, 14, 16.

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20.

This gives us the final answer: [20].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 7>
<8, 13, 1>
<2, 18, 12>
<7, 12, 17>
<1, 8, 19>
<17, 13, 16>
<19, 1, 3>
<10, 2, 4>
<15, 8, 14>
<4, 0, 10>
<11, 9, 7>
<3, 19, 14>
<16, 6, 13>
