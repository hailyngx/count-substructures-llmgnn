Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: deg(0) = 5
- Node 1: deg(1) = 5
- Node 3: deg(3) = 5
- Node 6: deg(6) = 5
- Node 9: deg(9) = 6

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
