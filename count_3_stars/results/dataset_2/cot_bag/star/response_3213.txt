Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 23) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (4, 5) (4, 29) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 27) (29, 4) (29, 19) (1, 9) (1, 22) (1, 27) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (21, 14) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 22) (14, 26) (14, 21) (22, 1) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 22) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 25) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 12) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 27) (27, 13) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 22) (23, 13) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 5, 9, 12, 16, 22, and 26. Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star

For node 26, we can form a 3-star in 3 different ways:
- <26, (14, 21, 7)>
- <26, (10, 3, 27)>
- <26, (15, 0, 7)>

Therefore, there are 7 + 3 = 10 3-stars in total.
Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final result: [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 22, 27)>, <5, (4, 12, 19)>, <9, (1, 12, 25)>, <12, (9, 5, 25)>, <16, (2, 17, 25)>, <22, (1, 19, 28)>, <26, (14, 21, 7)>, <26, (10, 3, 27)>, <26, (15, 0, 7)>
