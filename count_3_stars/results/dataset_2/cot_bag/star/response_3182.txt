Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with the highest degree in this graph are nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7, each with a degree of 5. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0:
   - It is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 8, and 2.
   - The number of 3-stars formed with node 0 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - The unique 3-stars with node 0 are <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (6, 4, 8)>, and <0, (5, 6, 2)>.

2. Node 5:
   - It is connected to nodes 2, 8, 1, 0, and 3.
   - The number of 3-stars formed with node 5 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - The unique 3-stars with node 5 are <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>, and <5, (2, 1, 3)>.

3. Node 6:
    - It is connected to nodes 1, 7, 3, 8, and 0.
    - The number of 3-stars formed with node 6 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - The unique 3-stars with node 6 are <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, and <6, (1, 3, 0)>.

4. Node 7:
    - It is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 3.
    - The number of 3-stars formed with node 7 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - The unique 3-stars with node 7 are <7, (9, 6, 2)> and <7, (9, 6, 3)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34
The final answer is [34].
