Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node with more than 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars.

For node 6, we have 4 neighbors (5, 1, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars centered at 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

The 3-stars centered at 6 are:
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 9, we also have 4 neighbors (6, 8, 2, 7). So, the number of 3-stars centered at 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

The 3-stars centered at 9 are:
<9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>

Adding these together, we have a total of 8 3-stars, so the final answer is [8].
