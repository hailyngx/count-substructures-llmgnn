Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 19) (4, 0) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 19. The graph has the following structure:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 8, 7)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (17, 6, 13, 18)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (18, 12, 3, 7)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (14, 11, 13, 2)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 19)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (11, 0, 10)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (9, 1, 10)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (17, 2, 0, 19)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (13, 0)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (6, 11, 12)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (6, 12)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (5, 9, 3)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (9, 10, 2)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (8, 3, 1, 15)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (17, 3, 19)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (17, 13, 19)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (14, 1, 15, 7)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (2, 1)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (14, 7, 15, 4)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (13, 15, 17)>, <2, (3, 7, 18)>, <3, (2, 13, 14)>, <5, (0, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 9, 10)>, <7, (0, 19, 17)>, <9, (6, 11, 12)>, <11, (3, 5, 9)>, <13, (1, 15, 17)>, <14, (17, 19, 14)>, <15, (13, 17, 19)>, <17, (7, 14, 15)>, <19, (14, 7, 15)>
