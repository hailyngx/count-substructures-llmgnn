Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 12, 13>
<2, 6, 10>
<3, 0, 13>
<4, 10, 11>
<7, 8, 12>
<9, 11, 14>
