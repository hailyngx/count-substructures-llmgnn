Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 11, 7, 12, and 13.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (11, 7, 13)>, <0, (11, 12, 13)>, <0, (7, 12, 13)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 11, 2, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 11, 2)>, <1, (3, 11, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <1, (11, 2, 8)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 14, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 11, 5)>, <3, (1, 14, 5)>, <3, (11, 14, 5)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 12, 13, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (8, 12, 13)>, <4, (8, 12, 5)>, <4, (8, 13, 5)>, <4, (12, 13, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 4, 2, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 3, 4)>, <5, (6, 3, 2)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 5, 0, and 13.
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 8, 5)>, <7, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 8, 13)>, <7, (9, 5, 0)>, <7, (9, 5, 13)>, <7, (9, 0, 13)>, <7, (8, 5, 0)>, <7, (8, 5, 13)>, <7, (8, 0, 13)>, <7, (5, 0, 13)>

For the rest of the nodes (8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), each has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars with these nodes as the center is also 4 for each.
Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4+4+4+4+10+10+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 60\).
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 60. 

Therefore, the answer is [60].
