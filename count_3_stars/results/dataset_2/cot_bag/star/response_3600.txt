Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 3) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 25) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 18) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 16) (20, 8) (20, 14) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 24) (29, 19) (29, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 2) (10, 13) (21, 11) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 4) (28, 19) (28, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 21) (11, 14) (14, 20) (14, 11) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 2) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 26) (16, 19) (25, 23) (25, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {22, 12}
- Node 1: {26, 18, 4}
- Node 2: {24, 25, 5, 28}
- Node 3: {22, 29, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {15, 12, 2}
- Node 6: {17, 18}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 12, 8}
- Node 8: {23, 20, 7}
- Node 9: {18, 19}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {15, 12, 21, 14}
- Node 12: {27, 7, 5, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {22, 10, 23, 7, 18}
- Node 14: {20, 11}
- Node 15: {27, 7, 5, 11}
- Node 16: {26, 19}
- Node 17: {24, 6}
- Node 18: {13, 1, 9, 6}
- Node 19: {29, 28, 4, 9, 16}
- Node 20: {8, 14}
- Node 21: {11}
- Node 22: {13, 0, 3}
- Node 23: {13, 8, 26, 25}
- Node 24: {27, 26, 17, 2}
- Node 25: {23, 2}
- Node 26: {23, 1, 24, 16}
- Node 27: {15, 12, 24}
- Node 28: {19, 2}
- Node 29: {19, 3}

Now, we'll find the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars: <7, (13, 12, 15)>, <7, (13, 8, 23)>, <7, (15, 12, 5)>, <7, (15, 11, 12)>, <7, (12, 8, 15)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 5 3-stars: <12, (15, 11, 7)>, <12, (15, 7, 5)>, <12, (7, 13, 15)>, <12, (7, 15, 5)>, <12, (13, 7, 15)>.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Summing these up, we have a total of 25 3-stars formed in the graph, which can be represented as [25].
