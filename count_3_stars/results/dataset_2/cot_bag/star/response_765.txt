Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 21) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 19) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 14) (29, 3) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 27) (22, 9) (22, 1) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 20) (20, 7) (20, 17) (20, 3) (23, 14) (19, 6) (19, 29) (19, 15) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 4) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 19) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (1, 5) (1, 22) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 25) (27, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 20) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 7, 21, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 21: Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 29: Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 

Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<7, (12, 16, 20)>
<21, (2, 17, 5)>
<29, (3, 14, 25)>
<29, (3, 19, 14)>
<29, (3, 19, 26)>
<29, (14, 19, 26)>
<29, (14, 23, 26)>
<29, (14, 23, 3)>
<29, (14, 23, 29)>
<29, (23, 26, 3)> 

Putting this final number inside brackets, there are [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
