Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are two nodes with  5 neighbors, nodes 4 and 7. 
Applying \( \binom{5}{3} \) to nodes 4 and 7, we find a total of 10 3-stars formed. 
The 3-stars formed with node 4 are <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, and <4, (8, 7, 6)>.
The 3-stars formed with node 7 are <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (9, 1, 0)>, <7, (8, 4, 6)>, and <7, (0, 9, 1)>.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
