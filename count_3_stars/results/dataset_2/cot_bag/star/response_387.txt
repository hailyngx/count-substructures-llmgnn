Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 102

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [102].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<4, (9, 10, 12)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 13)>
<10, (3, 4, 14)>
<12, (2, 11, 14)>
<13, (1, 2, 10)>
<14, (7, 10, 11)>
