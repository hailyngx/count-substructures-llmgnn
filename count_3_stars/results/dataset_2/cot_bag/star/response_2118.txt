Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 110

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [110].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 13, 2)>, <0, (1, 11, 10)>, <0, (14, 10, 6)>, <0, (14, 12, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 5)>, <1, (8, 12, 14)>, <1, (8, 6, 3)>, <1, (11, 13, 0)>, <2, (0, 13, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 10)>, <2, (9, 5, 6)>, <2, (13, 0, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 10)>, <3, (2, 10, 14)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 13, 2)>, <4, (6, 1, 5)>, <4, (8, 6, 1)>, <4, (10, 11, 13)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <9, (2, 13, 0)>, <10, (6, 3, 2)>, <10, (9, 11, 1)>, <12, (8, 14, 0)>, <13, (0, 9, 5)>, <14, (0, 12, 8)>
