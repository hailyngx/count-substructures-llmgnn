Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. Here's the breakdown by node:

Node 5: Forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<5, (9, 4, 3)> <5, (9, 4, 0)> <5, (9, 4, 2)> <5, (9, 4, 7)> <5, (9, 4, 6)> <5, (9, 3, 7)> <5, (9, 3, 0)> <5, (9, 3, 2)> <5, (9, 0, 2)> <5, (4, 7, 0)>

Node 9: Forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
<9, (5, 6, 8)> <9, (5, 6, 4)> <9, (5, 8, 4)> <9, (5, 8, 1)> <9, (5, 4, 1)> <9, (6, 8, 1)> <9, (6, 4, 1)> <9, (8, 4, 1)> <9, (6, 4, 8)> <9, (6, 4, 3)> <9, (8, 1, 4)> <9, (8, 1, 6)> <9, (8, 1, 0)> <9, (4, 1, 6)> <9, (4, 1, 8)> <9, (4, 6, 8)> <9, (3, 1, 7)> <9, (3, 7, 0)> <9, (7, 0, 8)> <9, (6, 2, 1)>

Node 4: Forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<4, (5, 7, 0)> <4, (5, 7, 3)> <4, (5, 0, 7)> <4, (5, 0, 8)> <4, (7, 3, 2)> <4, (7, 2, 6)> <4, (7, 2, 0)> <4, (0, 7, 8)> <4, (0, 7, 3)> <4, (0, 8, 7)>

Node 7: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<7, (4, 0, 3)>

Node 1: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<1, (9, 6, 8)>

Node 3: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<3, (5, 9, 7)>

Node 6: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<6, (9, 1, 2)> <6, (9, 1, 8)> <6, (1, 2, 8)> <6, (2, 1, 8)>

Node 2: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<2, (5, 7, 6)>

Node 8: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<8, (9, 1, 0)>

Node 0: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<0, (5, 7, 8)> <0, (5, 7, 3)> <0, (7, 8, 3)> <0, (8, 7, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 53, so the answer is [53].
