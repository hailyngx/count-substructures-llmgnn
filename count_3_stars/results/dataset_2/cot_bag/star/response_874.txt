Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Degree 2 - No 3-star formed
- Node 1: Degree 3 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 2: Degree 4 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 3: Degree 6 - 4 3-stars formed: <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 4)>, <3, (4, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 4: Degree 3 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 5: Degree 4 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: Degree 5 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 7: Degree 4 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 8: Degree 5 - 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: Degree 2 - No 3-star formed

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [10].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (5, 9, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 4)>, 
<3, (4, 9, 0)>.
