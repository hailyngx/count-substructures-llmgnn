Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 \), which we will enclose in brackets [].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
