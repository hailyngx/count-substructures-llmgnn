Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 19) (12, 9) (27, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 22) (20, 15) (20, 23) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (6, 21) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 23) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 11) (10, 5) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 24) (18, 9) (18, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (14, 6) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 29) (2, 4) (4, 25) (4, 2) (29, 26) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 0) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 20) (23, 7) (23, 3) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 22) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with at least 3 neighbors in this graph. Let's find the 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 5 -> \([\binom{4}{3}]\) = 4 3-stars
   - <5, (1, 0, 10)>
   - <5, (1, 16, 29)>
   - <5, (0, 29, 25)>
   - <5, (0, 29, 26)>

2. Node 6 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <6, (19, 21, 14)>

3. Node 8 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <8, (21, 19, 25)>

4. Node 9 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <9, (12, 15, 18)>

5. Node 11 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <11, (6, 7, 22)>

6. Node 15 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <15, (9, 20, 22)>

7. Node 16 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <16, (7, 28, 1)>

8. Node 22 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <22, (15, 8, 11)>

9. Node 24 -> \([1]\) = 1 3-star
   - <24, (13, 18, 22)>

There are a total of \([4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [12]\) 3-stars in the graph.
