Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 1, 8. So it forms 1 3-star: <0, (9, 1, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 4, 0. So it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (9, 5, 4)>, <1, (9, 0, 5)>, <1, (5, 0, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 5, 4. So it forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 5, 4)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 4. So it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 4)>, <3, (7, 8, 4)>, <3, (9, 7, 4)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 2. So it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (6, 1, 3)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 7. So it forms 4 3-stars:<5, (1, 2, 8)>, 	<5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 2)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 8, 4. So it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, <6, (7, 4, 2)>, <6, (2, 8, 4)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 5, 8. So it forms 10 3-stars: <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 8)>, <7, (6, 5, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 5, 0, 7. So it forms 10 3-stars: <8, (6, 3, 5)>, <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (6, 5, 7)>,	<8, (6, 0, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)>, <8, (5, 0, 7)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 1, 7, 0. So it forms 4 3-stars: <9, (3, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 0)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 42 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [42].
