Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 8)>.
