Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
