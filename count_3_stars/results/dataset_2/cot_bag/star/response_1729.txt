Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 52 \)

So, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

... (more 3-stars omitted for brevity) ...
