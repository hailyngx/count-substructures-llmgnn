Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (21, 13) (21, 14) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 18) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 20) (19, 5) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 22) (29, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 6) (8, 24) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 12) (23, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 5) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 4) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 20) (18, 25) (18, 16) (4, 15) (4, 21) (4, 11) (4, 0) (22, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 5
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 2
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 3
- Node 20: 4
- Node 21: 3
- Node 22: 4
- Node 23: 1
- Node 24: 3
- Node 25: 3
- Node 26: 2
- Node 27: 3
- Node 28: 3
- Node 29: 3

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 8 * 1 = 8 3-stars
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 8 * 4 = 32 3-stars
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: 0 3-stars

Adding these up: 8 + 32 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (10, 13, 20)>
- <4, (0, 5, 15)>
- <5, (0, 15, 27)>
- <6, (10, 9, 27)>
- <9, (6, 10, 25)>
- <10, (2, 6, 26)>
- <18, (16, 20, 25)>
- <20, (2, 18, 25)>
- <21, (4, 11, 14)>
- <22, (1, 24, 29)>
- <24, (11, 22, 28)>
- <25, (9, 18, 20)>
- <26, (6, 10, 28)>
- <27, (3, 5, 6)>
- <28, (16, 22, 26)>
- <29, (11, 14, 22)>
