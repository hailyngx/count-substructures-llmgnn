Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 10, 11, 8, 12, 0, 9, 14, 2, 5, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 12 as the center.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

Adding these up: 35 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 111 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [111]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 8, 11)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <10, (11, 0, 13)>, <11, (4, 10, 6)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <12, (8, 6, 9)>, <0, (7, 10, 11)>, <9, (8, 12, 14)>, <14, (10, 9, 13)>, <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (4, 3, 2)>, <13, (10, 0, 9)>
