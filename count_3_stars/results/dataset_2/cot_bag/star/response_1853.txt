Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 19) (4, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 8. 

For node 2:
There are 5 edges connected to node 2. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 2.
<2, (1, 5, 12)>, <2, (1, 5, 19)>, <2, (1, 12, 19)>, <2, (5, 12, 19)>, <2, (1, 5, 15)>, <2, (1, 12, 15)>, <2, (5, 12, 15)>, <2, (1, 19, 15)>, <2, (12, 19, 15)>, <2, (5, 19, 15)>

For node 3:
There are 4 edges connected to node 3. Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 3 as it does not have at least 3 neighbors.

For node 8:
There are 4 edges connected to node 8. Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 8 as it does not have at least 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each central node, we have a total of [10].
