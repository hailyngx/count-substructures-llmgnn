Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 17, 18, 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 10, 12, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 6, 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 17, 2, 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 11, 16, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 8, 16
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 11
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 7, 2, 5
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 1
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 16
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 5
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 19, 5
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 4
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 19, 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 16

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 2 3-stars
<Node 0, 4, 17> and <0, 18, 19>

Node 1: 4 3-stars
<Node 1, 6, 8>, <1, 10, 4>, <1, 12, 0>, and <1, 7, 11>

Node 2: 1 3-star
<Node 2, 10, 4>

Node 3: 1 3-star
<3, 6, 13>

Node 4: 1 3-star
<4, 10, 2>

Node 5: 1 3-star
<5, 11, 16>

Node 6: 2 3-stars
<6, 3, 13> and <6, 1, 8>

Node 11: 1 3-star
<11, 9, 14>

Node 16: 1 3-star
<16, 6, 13>

Adding them up, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
