Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 15) (8, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 5) (1, 16) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 12) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (10, 4, 14), so we have 1 3-star <0, (10, 4, 14)>.
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (11, 18, 19), so we have 1 3-star <2, (11, 18, 19)>.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (11, 18, 19), so we have 1 3-star <3, (11, 18, 19)>.
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 13).
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (7, 16, 18), so we have 1 3-star <5, (7, 16, 18)>.
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (5, 13, 15), so we have 1 3-star <7, (5, 13, 15)>.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (6, 14, 19), so we have 1 3-star <9, (6, 14, 19)>.
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (0, 14, 15, 17), so we have 4 3-stars <10, (0, 14, 15)>, <10, (0, 14, 17)>, <10, (0, 15, 17)>, <10, (14, 15, 17)>.
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 13, 15), so we have 4 3-stars <11, (2, 3, 13)>, <11, (2, 3, 15)>, <11, (2, 13, 15)> <11, (3, 13, 15)>.
- Node 13: 2 neighbors (4, 7).
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (0, 9, 10), so we have 1 3-star <14, (0, 9, 10)>.
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (7, 10, 11, 14), so we have 4 3-stars <15, (7, 10, 11)>, <15, (7, 10, 14)>, <15, (7, 11, 14)>, <15, (10, 11, 14)>.
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (1, 12, 13, 17), so we have 4 3-stars <16, (1, 12, 17)>, <16, (1, 13, 17)>, <16, (12, 13, 17)>, <16, (12, 16, 17)>.
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5), so we have 1 3-star <18, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 12), so we have 1 3-star <19, (2, 3, 12)>.

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of 17 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [17].
