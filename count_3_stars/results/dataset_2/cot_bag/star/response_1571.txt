Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Applying the rules described, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors

Total 3-stars formed with the identified central nodes:

- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 94 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
