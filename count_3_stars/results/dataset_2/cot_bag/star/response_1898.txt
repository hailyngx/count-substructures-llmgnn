Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [90].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (13, 3, 7)>
<1, (13, 4, 9)>
<3, (13, 9, 11)>
<4, (13, 5, 1)>
<5, (13, 6, 10)>
<8, (13, 12, 11)>
<9, (13, 0, 14)>
<11, (13, 3, 1)>
<12, (13, 8, 5)>
<13, (9, 3, 5)>
