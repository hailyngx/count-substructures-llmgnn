Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58. 

Therefore, the answer is: [58]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>
