Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: 
- Node 3 with neighbors {1, 10, 11, 13, 0, 8}
- Node 7 with neighbors {1, 10, 9, 8, 5, 0}
- Node 12 with neighbors {1, 4, 8, 5, 11, 14}

Calculating the possible 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 20 = 60

There are 60 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
<3, (1, 10, 11)>, <3, (1, 10, 13)>, <3, (1, 10, 0)>, <3, (1, 10, 8)>, <3, (1, 11, 13)>, <3, (1, 11, 0)>, <3, (1, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 13, 0)>, <3, (1, 13, 8)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (10, 11, 13)>, <3, (10, 11, 0)>, <3, (10, 11, 8)>, <3, (10, 13, 0)>, <3, (10, 13, 8)>, <3, (10, 0, 8)>, <3, (11, 13, 0)>, <3, (11, 13, 8)>, <3, (11, 0, 8)>, <3, (13, 0, 8)>, <7, (1, 10, 9)>, <7, (1, 10, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 8)>, <7, (10, 9, 8)>, <7, (10, 9, 5)>, <7, (9, 8, 5)>, <12, (1, 8, 4)>, <12, (1, 8, 5)>, <12, (1, 4, 5)>, <12, (8, 4, 5)>, <12, (8, 4, 11)>, <12, (8, 4, 14)>
