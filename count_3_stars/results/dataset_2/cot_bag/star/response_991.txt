Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 14. Let's analyze which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 104 \)

So, there are 104 3-stars formed in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 12)>
- <0, (4, 11, 6)>
- <0, (4, 11, 14)>
- <0, (4, 6, 2)>
- <0, (7, 6, 12)>
- <0, (7, 6, 14)>
- <0, (7, 14, 2)>
- <0, (6, 14, 12)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 14)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 12)>
- <5, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 14, 12)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <10, (5, 8, 14)>
- <11, (4, 8, 11)> 

Putting it all together, there are 104 3-stars in this graph: [104].
