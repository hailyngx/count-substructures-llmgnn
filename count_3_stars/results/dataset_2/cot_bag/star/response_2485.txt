Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
1: 7, 3, 6, 2
2: 7, 1, 6, 9, 0
3: 4, 7, 1, 0
4: 7, 9, 3, 6
5: 7, 6, 8
6: 4, 1, 9, 5, 2, 8
7: 4, 7, 2, 5, 1
8: 6, 5
9: 4, 6, 2, 0
0: 3, 9, 2

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 56 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is: [56]. 
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 6, 2)>, <1, (3, 1, 6)>, <2, (7, 1, 6)>, <2, (7, 1, 9)>, <2, (7, 1, 0)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 9, 2)>, <6, (1, 9, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <7, (4, 7, 5)>, <7, (4, 7, 1)>, <7, (4, 5, 1)>, <7, (7, 5, 1)>, <9, (4, 6, 2)>
