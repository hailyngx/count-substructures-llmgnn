Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors they have:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 2 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 4 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 27: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 2 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula given above:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Totaling up: 
1 * 7 (for nodes with 3 neighbors) + 4 * 13 (for nodes with 4 neighbors) = 55

So, there are [55] total 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (1, 9, 10)>
<3, (1, 5, 15)>

<5, (3, 11, 19)>
<6, (7, 15, 14)>
<7, (9, 15, 24)>
<8, (9, 13, 24)>
<9, (7, 28, 10)>
<11, (5, 25, 26)>
