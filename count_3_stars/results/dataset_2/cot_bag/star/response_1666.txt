Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 4, 9, 10, 11, 8, 1, 7, 14, 3, 0, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 68 \)

Thus, there are 68 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [68]
