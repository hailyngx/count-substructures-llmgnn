Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 18) (10, 16) (10, 2) (18, 12) (18, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 2) (15, 17) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 2 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 2 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 or more neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 
- No 3-stars will be formed for nodes with less than 4 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 \times \binom{4}{3}] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 17)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 12, 13)>
<16, (6, 10, 19)>
