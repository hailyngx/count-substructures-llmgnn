Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the possibilities, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
