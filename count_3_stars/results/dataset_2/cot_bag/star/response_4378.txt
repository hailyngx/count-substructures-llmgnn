Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the central nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 12. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <0, (7, 9, 12)>
    - <0, (7, 9, 14)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <3, (2, 6, 14)>
    - <3, (6, 10, 12)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (6, 7, 13)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <6, (1, 3, 12)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <9, (1, 11, 12)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <11, (9, 10, 13)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <12, (0, 6, 9)>
    
Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 73 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [73].
