Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 16) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: 1 3-star
- For node 4: 3-stars = 1
- For node 5: 3-stars = 2
- For node 7: 3-stars = 3
- For node 10: 3-stars = 3
- For node 11: 3-stars = 2
- For node 12: 3-stars = 2
- For node 13: 3-stars = 3
- For node 14: 3-stars = 2
- For node 15: 3-stars = 1
- For node 17: 3-stars = 1
- For node 18: 3-stars = 1
- For node 19: 3-stars = 1

So, adding up the total number of 3-stars for all eligible nodes = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

<10, (2, 4, 6)>
<11, (2, 17, 18)>
<12, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (7, 12, 5)>
<14, (4, 9, 3)>
<15, (0, 7, 19)>
<17, (4, 11, 6)>
<18, (0, 7, 11)>
