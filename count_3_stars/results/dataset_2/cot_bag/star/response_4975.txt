Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (19, 16) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 0) (17, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up gives the total number of 3-stars as \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 52 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 4, 1)>, <1, (5, 1, 6)>, <1, (5, 1, 14)>, <1, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 2, 19)>, <2, (5, 2, 12)>, <2, (5, 2, 13)>, <2, (19, 2, 12)>, <2, (19, 2, 13)>, <4, (5, 4, 17)>, <8, (14, 8, 15)>, <8, (14, 8, 18)>, <8, (14, 8, 1)>, <8, (14, 8, 7)>, <8, (18, 8, 16)>, <9, (1, 9, 13)>, <10, (4, 10, 18)>, <10, (4, 10, 11)>, <10, (4, 10, 18)>, <10, (11, 10, 18)>
