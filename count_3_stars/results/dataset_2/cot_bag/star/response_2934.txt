Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
We'll first represent the given graph visually:

```
   5 --- 1 --- 7 --- 6 --- 0
         |   | \ |  /  | / |
         |   |  \|/    |/  |
        \|/ \|/ \|/\|/ \|/
         3 --- 4 --- 8 --- 9
```

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up gives us a total of 68 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
