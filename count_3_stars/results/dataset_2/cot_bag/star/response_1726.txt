Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 2, 8, 0, 9, 4, 12, 14, 5, 6, 13.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all these possibilities, we have a total of \[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 84 \] 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 84.
