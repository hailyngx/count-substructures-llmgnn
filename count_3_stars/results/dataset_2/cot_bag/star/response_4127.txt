Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 12) (13, 3) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 12) (7, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and identify the unique 3-stars:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
   <1, (11, 16, 10)>, <1, (11, 16, 14)>, <1, (11, 10, 14)>, <1, (16, 10, 14)>

2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star:
   <3, (11, 15, 13)>

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
   <4, (6, 9, 18)>, <4, (6, 9, 2)>, <4, (6, 18, 2)>, <4, (9, 18, 2)>

4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
   <6, (9, 18, 4)>, <6, (9, 18, 8)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (18, 4, 8)>

5. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
   <9, (6, 18, 4)>, <9, (6, 18, 2)>, <9, (6, 18, 14)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 14)>, <9, (6, 2, 14)>, <9, (18, 4, 2)>, <9, (18, 4, 14)>, <9, (18, 2, 14)>, <9, (4, 2, 14)>

6. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
   <12, (16, 9, 2)>, <12, (16, 9, 5)>, <12, (16, 9, 8)>, <12, (16, 2, 5)>, <12, (16, 2, 8)>, <12, (16, 5, 8)>, <12, (9, 2, 5)>, <12, (9, 2, 8)>, <12, (9, 5, 8)>, <12, (2, 5, 8)>

7. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star:
   <16, (11, 1, 12)>

8. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
   <18, (6, 4, 9)>, <18, (6, 4, 8)>, <18, (6, 9, 8)>, <18, (4, 9, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [38] \).
