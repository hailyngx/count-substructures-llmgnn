This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (15, 12) (27, 14) (27, 5) (27, 23) (5, 27) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 17) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 24) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 22) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (4, 9) (4, 22) (4, 0) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (20, 1) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 10) (14, 27) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 19) (29, 22) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 16) (25, 5) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 13) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 23)

Nodes: 30
Edges: 90

Edges:

(5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7)
(1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1)

(21, 23) (21, 24) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 22) 
(24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (4, 9) 
(4, 22) (4, 0) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (11, 7) 
(7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (20, 1) (0, 28) (0, 4) 
(0, 29) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 10) (14, 27) 
(14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 14) (13, 6) 
(13, 19) (29, 22) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 8) (23, 27) 
(23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 16) (25, 5) (25, 6) (19, 1) 
(19, 6) (19, 13) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 23)
```

We will now count the number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the relevant nodes for each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 5: (3, 5), (5, 9), (5, 25)
2. Node 9: (4, 9), (7, 9), (9, 5)
3. Node 12: (1, 12), (12, 14), (12, 15)
4. Node 16: (3, 16), (16, 18), (16, 23)
5. Node 17: (17, 18), (17, 22), (17, 24)
6. Node 21: (21, 23), (21, 24), (21, 28)
7. Node 22: (4, 22), (22, 17), (22, 29)
8. Node 23: (2, 23), (21, 23), (23, 27)
9. Node 24: (17, 24), (24, 21), (24, 26)
10. Node 28: (6, 28), (21, 28), (28, 9)

Calculating the number of 3-stars from each relevant node:
1. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Since each relevant node contributes to 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10.   
Therefore, the final result is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (3, 9, 25)>, <9, (4, 7, 5)>, <12, (1, 14, 15)>, <16, (3, 18, 23)>, <17, (18, 22, 24)>, <21, (23, 24, 28)>, <22, (4, 17, 29)>, <23, (2, 21, 27)>, <24, (17, 21, 26)>, <28, (6, 21, 9)>.
