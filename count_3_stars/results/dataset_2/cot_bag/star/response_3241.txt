Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors, so we will check each of those nodes to see if they form 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 10, 7, 14), so it can form 1 3-star.
  
For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 4, 2, 14, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
  
For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (5, 9, 13, 12, 0, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (7, 4, 0, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
  
For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (7, 12, 11, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.
  
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars: 
- <5, 9, 10, 7>
- <9, 5, 14, 7>
- <7, 5, 14, 9>
- <12, 7, 0, 6>
- <0, 7, 1, 11> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
