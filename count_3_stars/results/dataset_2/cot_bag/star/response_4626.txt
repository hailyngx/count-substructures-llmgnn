Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 9) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 15) (6, 22) (6, 4) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 10) (2, 8) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 7) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 16) (11, 28) (11, 27) (11, 29) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 20) (17, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 21) (16, 26) (16, 5) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 24) (1, 14) (1, 0) (29, 11) (5, 23) (5, 16) (5, 27) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 20) (20, 24) (20, 7) (20, 18) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 18) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (21, 25) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 18) (27, 11) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 10) (14, 1) (14, 9) (18, 20) (18, 15) (18, 21) (10, 25) (10, 28) (10, 27) (10, 9) (4, 6) (4, 28) (4, 2) (4, 0) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 22, 23, 28, 2, 8, 26, 11, 24, 12, 16, 19, 7, 20, 21, 27, 25, 15, 5, 10, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <3, (9, 0, 14)>, <22, (8, 12, 19)>, <23, (26, 5, 15)>, <28, (10, 11, 27)>, <2, (8, 4, 19)>, <8, (22, 12, 2)>, <26, (13, 23, 2)>, <11, (28, 27, 29)>, <24, (3, 19, 20)>, <12, (8, 13, 21)>, <16, (26, 5, 15)>, <19, (22, 2, 24)>, <7, (13, 17, 20)>, <20, (24, 7, 18)>, <21, (25, 12, 27)>, <27, (11, 5, 21)>, <25, (15, 21, 10)>, <15, (25, 23, 18)>, <5, (23, 16, 27)>.
