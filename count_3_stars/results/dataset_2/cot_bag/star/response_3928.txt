Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

So, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<0, (2, 6, 9)>  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>  
<0, (3, 6, 9)>  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<4, (1, 3, 7)>  
<4, (1, 5, 8)>  
<4, (3, 5, 7)>  
<5, (0, 7, 9)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<8, (1, 5, 9)>  
<8, (3, 4, 9)>  
<8, (3, 5, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 5)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
