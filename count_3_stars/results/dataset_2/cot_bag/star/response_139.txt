Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 5) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Since a 3-star requires a central node with exactly three other connected nodes, we'll look for nodes with at least three incident edges. 

From the list of edges provided, we can see that nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (degree 6)
- Node 2 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 5)
- Node 6 (degree 6)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 10 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 5)
- Node 12 (degree 4)

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

Now, we list down the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (8, 11, 12)>
- <2, (3, 5, 14)>
- <3, (1, 6, 11)>
- <5, (0, 10, 12)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <10, (0, 3, 5)>
- <11, (3, 4, 14)>
- <12, (0, 5, 13)>
