Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 3, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 2, 8
- Node 2: 9, 6, 7, 1
- Node 3: 9, 0
- Node 4: 5, 9, 6
- Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 8, 1
- Node 8: 5, 0, 7, 1
- Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 1 (degree 5): 5, 6, 7, 2, 8
- Node 2 (degree 4): 9, 6, 7, 1
- Node 4 (degree 3): 5, 9, 6
- Node 5 (degree 6): 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, 0
- Node 6 (degree 5): 5, 9, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8 (degree 4): 5, 0, 7, 1
- Node 9 (degree 5): 5, 6, 4, 2, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 2)>, <1, (8, 5, 0)>, <1, (8, 7, 2)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <2, (6, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 0, 3)>
