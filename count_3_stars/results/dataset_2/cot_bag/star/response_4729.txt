Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 18) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 3) (4, 9) (8, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 6) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 6) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 15) (6, 16) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is \( [50] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 17, 19)>
- <0, (12, 17, 19)>
- <0, (1, 2, 19)>
- <0, (1, 2, 12)>
- <0, (1, 12, 17)>
- <1, (0, 9, 13)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (15, 18, 10)>
- <2, (15, 18, 13)>
- <2, (10, 15, 18)>
- <2, (0, 15, 18)>
- <3, (17, 18, 7)>
- <3, (17, 18, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 13)>
- <15, (6, 10, 16)>
- <15, (2, 13, 18)>
- <15, (10, 13, 18)>
- <15, (6, 16, 18)>
- <16, (6, 15, 19)>
- <17, (0, 12, 19)>
