Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8, 13)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 10, 13)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 12)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 6, 12, 14)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 4, 5, 7)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 1, 9, 12, 13)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 8, 11, 14)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 10, 13)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes above:
1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 61

So, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 9, 13)>
<9, (8, 11, 14)>
<12, (4, 10, 13)>
<13, (3, 8, 10)>
<14, (0, 9, 13)>
