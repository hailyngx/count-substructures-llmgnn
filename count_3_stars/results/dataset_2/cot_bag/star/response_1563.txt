Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, and 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 8, 18)>
<2, (4, 14, 16)>
<3, (10, 15, 16)>
<4, (2, 10, 18)>
<5, (0, 11, 19)>
<6, (1, 9, 12)>
<7, (9, 13, 5)>
<8, (15, 13, 1)>
<13, (8, 7, 1)>
<15, (3, 10, 16)>
<18, (1, 4, 6)>
