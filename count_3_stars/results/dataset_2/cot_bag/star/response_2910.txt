Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 4, 2, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {2, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 7, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 1}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 2, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

So, the final answer is [54].
