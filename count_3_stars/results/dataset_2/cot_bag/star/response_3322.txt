Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 21) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 26) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 23) (4, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 24) (1, 13) (1, 22) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (12, 25) (12, 22) (20, 15) (20, 21) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 3) (26, 14) (26, 6) (9, 28) (9, 23) (2, 13) (2, 22) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (21, 16) (21, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (10, 25) (10, 0) (10, 27) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 17) (6, 26) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 0) (23, 15) (23, 9) (23, 14) (23, 27) (5, 11) (5, 22) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 13: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 22: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 24: 4 neighbors => 4 3-stars
- Node 26: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 28: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 43

So, there are 43 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, we write the total number of 3-stars inside brackets []: [43].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

<3, 7, 16>
<5, 14, 22>
<13, 18, 28>
<15, 20, 21>
<19, 17, 29>
<0, 10, 25>
<0, 10, 27>
<18, 5, 6>
<5, 18, 22>
<7, 16, 21>
<13, 1, 22>
<15, 3, 7>
<16, 11, 19>
<16, 15, 20>
<22, 1, 13>
<22, 2, 12>
<23, 9, 14>
<24, 0, 4>
<24, 0, 22>
<24, 8, 17>
