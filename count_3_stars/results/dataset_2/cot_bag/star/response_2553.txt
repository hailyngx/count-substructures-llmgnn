Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 12, 5, 6, 9, 0, 10, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, there are [72] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 7, 13)>
<13, (4, 8, 0)>
<12, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 7, 14)>
<6, (3, 4, 10)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 13)>
<10, (6, 0, 14)>
<14, (5, 7, 10)>
