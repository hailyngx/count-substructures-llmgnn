Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 2, and 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, and 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8, and 0), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, and 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9, and 1), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from all these nodes, we get a total of 48 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [48].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
