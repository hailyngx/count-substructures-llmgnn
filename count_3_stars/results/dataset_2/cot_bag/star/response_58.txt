Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8  
Node 1: 0, 2  
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 9  
Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7  
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9  
Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 8: 0, 3  
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7  

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
