Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 20) (11, 15) (16, 25) (16, 3) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 27) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 20) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 13) (8, 10) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 29) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 23) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 20) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 23) (28, 18) (28, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (24, 7) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 21) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 25) (20, 11) (20, 14) (20, 9) (20, 22) (29, 4) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 21) (27, 1) (27, 3) (27, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 21) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 29) (23, 9) (23, 7) (21, 15) (21, 29) (21, 25) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the total number of 3-stars centered at those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29.

Now, we will compute the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Does not have enough neighbors for a 3-star)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the counts for each node, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 30 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <1, 3, 27>
- <4, 14, 20>
- <4, 18, 28>
- <4, 29, 5>
- <5, 26, 10>
- <7, 0, 17>
- <9, 0, 22>
- <9, 20, 22>
- <9, 22, 27>
- <10, 13, 29>
- <11, 15, 28>
- <15, 21, 29>
- <18, 17, 7>
- <20, 14, 9>
- <21, 15, 29>
- <25, 16, 19>
