Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 5, 9, 4, 8
Node 1: 7, 3, 2
Node 2: 5, 7, 1, 6
Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 8
Node 4: 9, 7, 0
Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 0
Node 6: 9, 7, 2
Node 7: 9, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1
Node 8: 5, 3, 0
Node 9: 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 7 and Node 9 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
Node 5, Node 3, and Node 2 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>.
