Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 10, 11, 1, 17, 8, 13, 18, 19, 15, 6, 7, 3, 14, 9, 12, 16, 5, and 2.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<11, (5, 7, 10)>
<1, (8, 17, 6)>

<1, (6, 17, 13)>
<17, (1, 6, 13)>
<8, (1, 14, 18)>
<8, (3, 14, 18)>
<8, (3, 18, 14)>
<8, (14, 18, 3)>
<13, (12, 16, 17)>
<18, (12, 19, 5)>
<18, (12, 5, 19)>
<18, (5, 12, 19)>
<18, (19, 5, 12)>
<19, (7, 14, 18)>
<19, (7, 18, 14)>
<19, (14, 18, 7)>
<19, (18, 14, 7)>
