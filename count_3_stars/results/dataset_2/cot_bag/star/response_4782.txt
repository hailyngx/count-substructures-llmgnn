Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (4, 10) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {5, 19}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 19}
- Node 2: {7, 10}
- Node 3: {12, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {10}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 12, 13, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 9, 16}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 9, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8, 18}
- Node 11: {14, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 13: {5, 8}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 19}
- Node 15: {11}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 17: {12}
- Node 18: {3, 9, 10}
- Node 19: {0, 1, 14}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms <1, (6, 9, 19)>
- Node 5 forms <5, (0, 6, 12)> and <5, (6, 13, 16)>
- Node 7 forms <7, (2, 8, 16)> and <7, (7, 9, 16)>
- Node 9 forms <9, (1, 12, 18)> and <9, (7, 14, 18)>
- Node 12 forms <12, (3, 9, 17)>
- Node 16 forms <16, (3, 7, 11)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars is [8].
