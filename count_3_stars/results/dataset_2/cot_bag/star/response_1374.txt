Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 10, 11, 5, 8, 0, 6, 2, 4, 12, 14, 9, and 13. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 67 \). 

So, the final answer to the question is [67].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 9, 10)>, <1, (0, 9, 13)>, <1, (0, 9, 12)>, <1, (0, 10, 12)>, <1, (9, 10, 12)>, <1, (10, 11, 12)>, <1, (10, 11, 5)>, <1, (5, 11, 12)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 12)>, <3, (2, 5, 11)>, <3, (3, 5, 11)>, <10, (11, 12, 9)>, <10, (10, 11, 12)>, <11, (5, 6, 7)>, <11, (5, 6, 8)>, <11, (5, 6, 11)>, <11, (5, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 11)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 11)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 11)>, <8, (2, 6, 13)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 13)>, <0, (9, 13, 14)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 13)>, <2, (8, 13, 14)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <12, (9, 10, 11)>, <14, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (10, 12, 13)>, <13, (9, 10, 12)>
