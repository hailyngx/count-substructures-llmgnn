Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

1: 5, 6, 0  
2: 9, 6, 8, 1  
3: 5, 9, 4, 7, 0  
4: 9, 3  
5: 9, 8, 1, 3, 7  
6: 1, 2, 8, 0  
7: 5, 9, 0, 3  
8: 5, 6, 2  
9: 5, 9, 4, 2, 7

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.
Considering the formula mentioned earlier and given the neighbors of each of these nodes, we can determine the number of 3-stars centered at each node.

For node 1: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
For node 2: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 3: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 5: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 6: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 7: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 9: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Adding these up:
\[ [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [43] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <9, (5, 9, 4)>
