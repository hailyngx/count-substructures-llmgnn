Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 11
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 14
- Node 2: 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 12
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 10
- Node 5: 1, 4, 13
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 9, 14
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 11
- Node 8: 6, 12, 13
- Node 9: 6, 11, 13
- Node 10: 4, 12
- Node 11: 0, 2, 7, 9, 13
- Node 12: 2, 3, 8, 10
- Node 13: 2, 5, 8, 9, 11
- Node 14: 1, 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [¬ù0]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [0]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [0]

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0] = [9] \]

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in this graph:
\[ <0, (1, 6, 7)> \]
\[ <2, (3, 4, 14)> \]
\[ <4, (2, 5, 7)> \]
\[ <6, (0, 1, 8)> \]
\[ <7, (0, 4, 11)> \]
\[ <8, (6, 12, 13)> \]
\[ <9, (6, 11, 13)> \]
\[ <11, (0, 7, 13)> \]
\[ <13, (2, 8, 11)> \]
