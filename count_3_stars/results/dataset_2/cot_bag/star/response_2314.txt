Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5, 6, 2, 7  
Node 1: 6, 4  
Node 2: 9, 6, 8, 3, 0  
Node 3: 5, 9, 4, 2, 7  
Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 1, 3  
Node 5: 9, 4, 0, 3, 7  
Node 6: 1, 7, 2, 0  
Node 7: 5, 6, 0, 3  
Node 8: 4, 2  
Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3  

Now, we can identify the central nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are the central nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 2: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)  
Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  

Adding these up:  
\[10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 5, 9)>  
<3, (4, 5, 7)>  
<4, (3, 5, 9)>  
<5, (0, 3, 7)>  
<7, (0, 3, 5)>  
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
