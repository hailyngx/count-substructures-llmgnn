Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 12) (8, 16) (8, 18) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 19) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 16) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the combination formula \(\binom{n}{3}\) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
2. Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
3. Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
4. Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
5. Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
6. Node 11: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
7. Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
8. Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
9. Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
10. Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
11. Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
12. Node 17: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
13. Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
14. Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35\)

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets: \([35]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 3)>, <1, (3, 5, 12)>, <5, (1, 9, 3)>, <6, (0, 17, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 14)>, <11, (9, 16, 13)>, <12, (1, 9, 15)>, <13, (9, 6, 12)>, <14, (7, 9, 19)>, <15, (1, 11, 12)>, <16, (8, 10, 15)>, <17, (0, 6, 18)>, <18, (17, 8, 13)>, <19, (7, 14, 4)>
