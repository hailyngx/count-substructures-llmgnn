Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 3) (18, 14) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 6) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 6) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, so we can look for 3-stars based on those nodes:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (16, 5, 17, 2)
  Number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  Unique 3-stars with node 11: <11, (16, 5, 17)>, <11, (16, 5, 2)>, <11, (16, 17, 2)>, <11, (5, 17, 2)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 0, 15, 2)
  Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (8, 0, 15)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 15, 2)>, <4, (0, 15, 2)>

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 7, 14)
  Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  Unique 3-stars with node 0: <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 14)>, <0, (5, 7, 14)>, <0, (4, 7, 14)>

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (7, 13, 1, 17, 3)
  Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-stars with node 6: <6, (7, 13, 1)>, <6, (7, 13, 17)>, <6, (7, 13, 3)>, <6, (7, 1, 17)>, <6, (7, 1, 3)>, <6, (7, 17, 3)>, <6, (13, 1, 17)>, <6, (13, 1, 3)>, <6, (13, 17, 3)>, <6, (1, 17, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \)

So the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
