Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 3) (1, 5) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 19) (16, 17) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: Adjacent to nodes 5, 14, 13, and 10 (degree = 4)
- Node 3: Adjacent to nodes 9, 14, 8, and 19 (degree = 4)
- Node 8: Adjacent to nodes 10, 11, 12, and 3 (degree = 4)
- Node 9: Adjacent to nodes 5, 10, 3, and 13 (degree = 4)
- Node 10: Adjacent to nodes 9, 8, 2, and 12 (degree = 4)
- Node 11: Adjacent to nodes 5, 4, and 8 (degree = 3)
- Node 12: Adjacent to nodes 14, 8, and 10 (degree = 3)
- Node 13: Adjacent to nodes 9, 7, 17, and 2 (degree = 4)
- Node 15: Adjacent to nodes 0, 7, 17 (degree = 3)
- Node 17: Adjacent to nodes 13, 16, 19, and 15 (degree = 4)
- Node 18: Adjacent to nodes 4, 19 (degree = 2)
- Node 19: Adjacent to nodes 9, 18, 17, and 3 (degree = 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with degree = 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node
- For nodes with degree = 3: One 3-star per node

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4(5) + 1(3) = 23

So, the final count of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 14, 13)>
<3, (9, 8, 19)>
<8, (10, 11, 12)>
<9, (5, 10, 3)>
<10, (9, 8, 12)>
<11, (5, 4, 8)>
<13, (9, 7, 17)>
<15, (0, 7, 17)>
<17, (13, 16, 19)>
<19, (9, 18, 17)>
