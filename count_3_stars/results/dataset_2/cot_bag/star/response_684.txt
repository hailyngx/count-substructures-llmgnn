Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 8) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (0, 18) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 17) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's go through each of these nodes to find the 3-stars formed with them:

1. Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 2, 5, 7
2. Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 8, 14, 18
3. Node 8: Neighbors are 9, 3, 18, 15, 11
4. Node 10: Neighbors are 6, 19, 13, 16
5. Node 16: Neighbors are 9, 4, 0, 10

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars within this graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars are:

<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 18, 8)>
<3, (1, 14, 8)>
<3, (1, 18, 8)>
<3, (14, 18, 8)>
<8, (9, 18, 15)>
<8, (9, 3, 15)>
<8, (9, 11, 15)>
<8, (3, 15, 11)>
<8, (9, 3, 11)>
<10, (6, 13, 16)>
<10, (19, 6, 13)>
<10, (19, 13, 16)>
<10, (6, 19, 16)>
<16, (9, 0, 4)>
<16, (9, 10, 4)>
<16, (4, 0, 10)>
<16, (9, 4, 10)>
