Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 17) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (19, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 18) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (2, 3) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 17) (9, 10) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 37 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (1, 5, 12)>, <3, (5, 12, 18)>, <3, (2, 5, 19)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>, <5, (3, 6, 14)>, <7, (0, 15, 17)>, <7, (15, 16, 17)>, <10, (8, 13, 9)>, <10, (13, 4, 9)>, <16, (4, 12, 18)>, <16, (7, 12, 18)>, <17, (0, 6, 15)>, <17, (6, 9, 15)>, <17, (2, 9, 15)>, <17, (2, 6, 9)>, <17, (7, 9, 15)>, <18, (12, 16, 17)>
