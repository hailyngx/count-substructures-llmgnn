Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 43 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
