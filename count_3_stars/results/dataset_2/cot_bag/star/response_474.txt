Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
There are 4 neighbors of node 1: 5, 4, 8, and 9.
The total number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2: 5, 9, 0, and 3.
The total number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 6:
There are 6 neighbors of node 6: 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and 0.
The total number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 20] = [28] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>, <6, (8, 7, 0)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)>
