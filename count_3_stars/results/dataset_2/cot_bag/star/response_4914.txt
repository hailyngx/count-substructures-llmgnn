Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 8) (1, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 110 \)

Therefore, there are 110 3-stars in the graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets yields: [110]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
