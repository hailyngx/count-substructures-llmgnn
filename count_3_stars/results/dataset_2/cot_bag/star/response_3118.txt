Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 73 \). 

So there are a total of 73 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting it inside brackets, we have a total of [73].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 6, 10)>, 
<3, (2, 11, 14)>,
<4, (6, 12, 13)>,
<5, (2, 6, 13)>,
<5, (1, 5, 10)>,
<5, (1, 5, 13)>,
<6, (4, 5, 10)>,
<6, (4, 5, 13)>,
<10, (5, 6, 12)>,
<11, (2, 11, 14)>,
<14, (0, 11, 9)>,
<14, (3, 11, 9)>.
