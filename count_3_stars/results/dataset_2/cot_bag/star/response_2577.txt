Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (6, 8, 7) [1 3-star]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7, 8, 2) [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (9, 13, 7, 3, 1) [inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars]
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (9, 7, 5, 1) [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: (4, 8, 13, 11, 10, 12) [inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars]
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: (4, 0, 11, 10, 2, 1) [inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (6, 4, 0, 1) [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (6, 4, 2, 14, 13, 0) [inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars]
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (7, 5, 12, 1) [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (9, 5, 14, 2) [inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars]
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (9, 13, 3) [1 3-star]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 92

Therefore, there are [92] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 13, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<8, (6, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<10, (7, 5, 12)>
<13, (9, 5, 14)>
