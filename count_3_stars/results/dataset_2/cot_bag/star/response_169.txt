Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 25) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 27) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 19) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 4) (21, 6) (21, 18) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (12, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (23, 17) (29, 6) (29, 10) (29, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 25) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 1) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 24) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 18) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the combinatorial formula mentioned earlier:

For node 1, there are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed with this node is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 2, there are 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed with this node is 1.

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed with this node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed with this node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 15 there are 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively. So, the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), and 1 respectively.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 100 \). Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 100, which we write as \([100]\).

Finally, listing the unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 14, 24)>
<2, (0, 5, 15)>
<4, (5, 9, 15)>
<6, (9, 25, 29)>
<7, (8, 24, 28)>
<8, (10, 11, 20)>
<9, (4, 7, 24)>
<10, (26, 27, 29)>
<11, (8, 14, 18)>
<14, (1, 11, 18)>
<15, (0, 2, 4)>
<18, (8, 11, 25)>
<19, (17, 16, 28)>
<20, (8, 26, 27)>
<22, (1, 13, 24)>
<24, (1, 7, 9)>
<26, (10, 20, 29)>
<27, (4, 10, 26)>
<28, (7, 16, 19)>
<29, (6, 10, 26)>
