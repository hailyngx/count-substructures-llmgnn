Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5 and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.

For node 9:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Adding these together, we get a total of \( [4 + 10] = 14 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
