Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [53].

And the unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (7, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 7, 3)>
- <2, (3, 7, 4)>
- <2, (3, 1, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (8, 6, 4)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 9, 5)>
