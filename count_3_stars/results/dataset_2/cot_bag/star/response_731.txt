Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 4), (9, 5), (9, 11), (9, 10), (9, 12), (8, 13), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 7), (13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 3), (13, 1), (13, 14), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 1), (4, 2), (7, 8), (7, 3), (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 0), (12, 11), (2, 4), (2, 10), (2, 3), (6, 5), (6, 14), (6, 10), (6, 3), (0, 12), (0, 14), (0, 10), (0, 11), (14, 13), (14, 6), (14, 0), (14, 11), (10, 9), (10, 8), (10, 2), (10, 6), (10, 0), (10, 3), (11, 9), (11, 8), (11, 12), (11, 0), (11, 14), (3, 13), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 10), (1, 13), (1, 4)

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 13
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 11, 12

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For nodes with 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star for each

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 5 = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<8, (13, 10, 11)>
<9, (5, 11, 12)>
<13, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 14, 10)>
<10, (9, 8, 2)>
<11, (9, 8, 12)>
<12, (4, 9, 0)>
