Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50

So, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 3, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 5)>
