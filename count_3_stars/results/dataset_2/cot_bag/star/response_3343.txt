Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (0, 3) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 6) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 8) (23, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 24) (11, 22) (11, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 8) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 16) (20, 29) (20, 13) (20, 19) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 28) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 12) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 25) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (28, 3) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 12) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 14) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 24) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 28) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 25) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 16) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 25) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 22, 19
- Node 1: 6, 28, 12
- Node 2: 10, 13, 25
- Node 3: 0, 28, 16
- Node 4: 26, 7, 13, 17
- Node 5: 26, 23, 18, 28
- Node 6: 27, 1, 25
- Node 7: 4, 15, 18
- Node 8: 23, 29, 15
- Node 9: 26
- Node 10: 12, 2, 24
- Node 11: 22, 17
- Node 12: 10, 1, 28
- Node 13: 4, 20, 2
- Node 14: 29, 18, 16
- Node 15: 7, 8, 24
- Node 16: 3, 14, 19, 25
- Node 17: 4, 11, 29
- Node 18: 5, 7, 14
- Node 19: 0, 20, 16
- Node 20: 13, 19, 29
- Node 21: 26, 25
- Node 22: 0, 11, 24
- Node 23: 8, 5
- Node 24: 22, 10, 15
- Node 25: 21, 6, 2, 16
- Node 26: 9, 5, 21, 4
- Node 27: 6
- Node 28: 3, 5, 1, 12
- Node 29: 8, 17, 20, 14

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with exactly 1 neighbor: Node 9, Node 27
Nodes with exactly 2 neighbors: None
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, Node 26, Node 28, Node 29

Applying the combination formula:
For the nodes with 3 neighbors, there is one 3-star for each node. So, the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ [24] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 28>, <1, 6, 12>, <2, 10, 25>, <4, 7, 13>, <5, 18, 28>, <8, 15, 24>, <16, 19, 25>, <17, 11, 29>, <20, 14, 29>, <21, 25, 26>
