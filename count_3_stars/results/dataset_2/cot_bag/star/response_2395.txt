Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 9) (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 19) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 14) (6, 28) (6, 24) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 27) (10, 9) (10, 27) (17, 7) (17, 29) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 23) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 27) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 29) (5, 24) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 15) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 21) (14, 11) (14, 25) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (22, 7) (22, 3) (18, 12) (18, 8) (18, 24) (18, 13) (18, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 18) (21, 23) (23, 28) (23, 0) (23, 21) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 3-stars
- Node 11: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 3-stars
- Node 18: 3 3-stars
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 3 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 3 3-stars
- Node 28: 3 3-stars
- Node 29: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [31].
