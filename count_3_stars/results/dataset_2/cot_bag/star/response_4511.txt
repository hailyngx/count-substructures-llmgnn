Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as potential central nodes for 3-stars.
Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 34. Listing the unique 3-stars in <>:
