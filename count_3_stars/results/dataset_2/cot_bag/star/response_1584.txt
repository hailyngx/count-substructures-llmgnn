Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 29) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 6) (27, 13) (27, 0) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 16) (12, 21) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 10) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 2) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 17) (28, 17) (26, 22) (26, 10) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 8) (7, 15) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (24, 4) (24, 20) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 25) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 16) (15, 1) (15, 11) (15, 7) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 21) (17, 28) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 24) (19, 3) (19, 23) (19, 14) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 27, 0, 3, 6, 29, 21, 14, 23, 4, 20, 1, 17, 15, 5, 10, and 19.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in the given graph.  
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [56].
