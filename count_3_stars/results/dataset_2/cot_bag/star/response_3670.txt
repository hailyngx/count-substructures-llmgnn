Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 24) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 25) (22, 26) (22, 4) (23, 0) (23, 20) (10, 29) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 17) (18, 15) (19, 14) (26, 22) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 1) (6, 21) (6, 25) (6, 15) (28, 25) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (0, 23) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 27) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 27) (8, 3) (24, 9) (24, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 27) (25, 21) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 1) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 4) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 2, 29, 21, 4, 10, 11, 17, 6, 15, 16, 0, 14, 8, 25, 13, 12, 20, and 27.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <9, (5, 29, 8)>, <9, (5, 29, 24)>, <9, (5, 8, 24)>, <9, (29, 8, 24)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <21, (7, 6, 25)>, <21, (7, 20, 25)>, <21, (6, 20, 25)>, <21, (6, 15, 25)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <15, (7, 18, 8)>, <15, (7, 6, 8)>, <15, (18, 6, 8)>, <15, (18, 6, 16)>
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <0, (23, 10, 14)>, <0, (23, 10, 8)>, <0, (23, 14, 8)>, <0, (10, 14, 8)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), <14, (11, 19, 27)>, <14, (11, 0, 27)>, <14, (11, 3, 27)>, <14, (11, 0, 3)>, <14, (11, 0, 19)>, <14, (11, 3, 0)>, <14, (11, 19, 3)>, <14, (19, 27, 3)>, <14, (0, 27, 3)>, <14, (0, 19, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <8, (9, 0, 27)>, <8, (9, 15, 27)>, <8, (9, 3, 27)>, <8, (0, 15, 27)>
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), <25, (21, 13, 1)>, <25, (21, 6, 1)>, <25, (21, 28, 1)>, <25, (21, 13, 28)>, <25, (13, 6, 1)>, <25, (13, 28, 1)>, <25, (6, 28, 1)>, <25, (6, 13, 1)>, <25, (13, 1, 12)>, <25, (6, 1, 12)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these counts we get: 
1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 +â€Œ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].
