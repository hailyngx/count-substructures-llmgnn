Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph as described with its nodes and edges. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {6, 7}
- 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- 3: {4, 8}
- 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- 5: {2, 7, 8}
- 6: {0, 1, 2}
- 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- 9: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 6 neighbors, forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
<2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, but it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [70] unique 3-stars in the graph.
