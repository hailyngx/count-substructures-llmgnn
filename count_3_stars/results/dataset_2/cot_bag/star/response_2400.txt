Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
This node has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 0.

For node 2:
This node also has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 2.

For node 4:
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star associated with node 4.

For node 5:
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars associated with node 5.

For node 6:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star associated with node 6.

For node 7:
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 7.

For node 9:
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 62 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
