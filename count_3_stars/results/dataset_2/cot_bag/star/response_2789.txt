Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 35 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 107 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [107]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0,5,7)>
<4, (0,1,14)>
<6, (7,10,12)>
<7, (0,1,12)>
<9, (3,10,11)>
<10, (8,11,9)>
<12, (4,7,1)>
