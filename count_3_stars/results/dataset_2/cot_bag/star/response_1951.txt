Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 6) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 6) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 1) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 2) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 (neighbors: 9, 10, 7, 16)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 11, 4)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 6, 15, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 11)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 14)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 14, 3, 19)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 12, 13, 1)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 15, 11, 3)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 1, 0, 12)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 17, 0, 1, 16)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 14, 8, 4, 2)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 9, 7, 13, 19)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 17, 7, 12)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 5, 6, 11)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 3, 16, 18, 8)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 15, 10, 1)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 6, 12)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 4: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}(2,3) = 0 \)
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 14: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 19: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (9, 10, 7)>
<1, (9, 10, 16)>
<1, (9, 7, 16)>
<1, (10, 7, 16)>
<9, (5, 1, 12)>
<9, (5, 0, 12)>
<9, (1, 0, 12)>
<9, (10, 12, 16)>
<7, (12, 13, 19)>
<16, (15, 10, 1)>
