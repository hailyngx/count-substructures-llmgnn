Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 3, 15, 6, 9, 5, 2, 18, 8, 7, 12, 13, 19, 17, 1, 10, 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<11, (1, 6, 16)>, <11, (1, 7, 16)>, <11, (1, 11, 6)>, <11, (1, 11, 16)>, <16, (1, 5, 16)>, <3, (2, 3, 18)>, <3, (3, 6, 15)>, <3, (3, 7, 15)>, <3, (3, 15, 17)>, <3, (6, 7, 11)>, <3, (6, 11, 17)>, <3, (6, 11, 3)>, <3, (6, 3, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 17)>, <6, (6, 9, 17)>, <6, (6, 9, 5)>, <6, (11, 6, 16)>, <6, (11, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 9, 13)>, <9, (5, 9, 18)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 9, 17)>, <5, (5, 8, 14)>, <5, (8, 5, 14)>, <5, (8, 5, 9)>, <5, (13, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 2, 18)>, <8, (4, 8, 5)>, <8, (7, 8, 5)>, <8, (8, 7, 12)>, <8, (8, 7, 11)>, <7, (3, 7, 12)>, <7, (7, 12, 19)>, <7, (7, 11, 16)>, <7, (7, 11, 1)>, <12, (0, 12, 19)>, <13, (5, 13, 9)>, <19, (12, 19, 0)>, <17, (0, 17, 15)>, <17, (0, 17, 6)>, <17, (15, 17, 6)>, <1, (1, 10, 18)>, <0, (0, 17, 15)>
