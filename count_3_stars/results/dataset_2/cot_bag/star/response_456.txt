Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (18, 16) (18, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 19) (12, 4) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 19) (2, 3) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 15, 19)>
- <0, (6, 1, 14)>
- <0, (6, 1, 19)>
- <0, (6, 1, 5)>

- <0, (1, 14, 19)>
- <1, (6, 0, 14)>
- <1, (6, 0, 19)>
- <1, (6, 0, 5)>
- <1, (14, 10, 19)>
- <3, (2, 5, 10)>
- <3, (2, 5, 19)>
- <3, (2, 5, 0)>
- <3, (2, 5, 10)>
- <5, (0, 15, 6)>
- <5, (0, 15, 19)>
- <9, (7, 8, 19)>
- <9, (7, 8, 12)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (8, 10, 19)>
- <10, (14, 3, 1)>
- <10, (14, 3, 6)>
- <10, (14, 3, 19)>
- <10, (14, 3, 5)>
- <14, (1, 6, 10)>
- <19, (0, 15, 5)>
