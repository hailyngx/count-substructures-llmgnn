Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5

Let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 4)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>

For Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<3, (4, 1, 0)>
<3, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (3, 4, 0)>
<3, (3, 1, 0)>
<3, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (3, 1, 5)>

For Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<4, (7, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 0)>
<4, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (7, 3, 6)>
<4, (4, 5, 1)>
<4, (4, 5, 0)>
<4, (4, 5, 3)>
<4, (4, 1, 0)>
<4, (4, 1, 3)>
<4, (4, 0, 3)>
<4, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>

There are 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
