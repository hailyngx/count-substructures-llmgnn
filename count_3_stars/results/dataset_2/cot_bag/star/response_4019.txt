Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 0) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 6) (10, 5) (10, 18) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (3, 13) (8, 11) (8, 15) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 15) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [30] 3-stars formed in the graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 13, 15)>
- <9, (5, 12, 14)>
- <13, (5, 2, 3)>
- <17, (7, 15, 18)>
- <18, (6, 10, 19)>
