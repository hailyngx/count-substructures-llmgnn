Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 11, 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 10, 12
- Node 2: 1, 5, 10, 11, 12
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 14
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 10
- Node 6: 3, 8, 11, 14
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9, 12
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6, 12, 14
- Node 9: 7, 10, 14
- Node 10: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 11: 0, 2, 6
- Node 12: 1, 2, 7, 8, 13
- Node 13: 12
- Node 14: 4, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 10
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 10
- Node 13: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 8, 14)>, <1, (2, 8, 12)>, and <2, (1, 5, 10)>.
