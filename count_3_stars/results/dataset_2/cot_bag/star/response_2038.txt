Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 21) (15, 11) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 14) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 23) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 11) (6, 29) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 25) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (21, 15) (21, 4) (21, 11) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 24) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 25) (16, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 16) (10, 3) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 16) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 22) (23, 29) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 19) (2, 23) (2, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 22) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (14, 20) (14, 10) (14, 7) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 22) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 5, node 11, and node 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (20, 0), (16, 0), (9, 0), and (18, 0). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (23, 5), (8, 5), (25, 5), and (11, 5). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (15, 11), (5, 11), (21, 11), and (22, 11). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (4, 18), (19, 18), (9, 18), and (0, 18). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4+4+4+4 = 16. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (20, 0), (16, 0), (9, 0)>
- <5, (23, 5), (8, 5), (25, 5)>
- <11, (15, 11), (5, 11), (21, 11)>
- <18, (4, 18), (19, 18), (9, 18)>
