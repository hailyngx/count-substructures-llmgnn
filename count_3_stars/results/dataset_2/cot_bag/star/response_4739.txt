Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: 0 has 5 neighbors (9, 10, 6, 3, 12) => There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. <0, (9, 10, 6)>, <0, (9, 10, 3)>, <0, (9, 10, 12)>, <0, (9, 6, 3)>, <0, (9, 6, 12)>, <0, (9, 3, 12)>, <0, (10, 6, 3)>, <0, (10, 6, 12)>, <0, (10, 3, 12)>, <0, (6, 3, 12)>

15. Node 8: 8 has 3 neighbors (11, 7, 1) => There is 1 3-star. <8, (11, 7, 1)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found for each node, we get a total of 58 3-stars. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [58].
