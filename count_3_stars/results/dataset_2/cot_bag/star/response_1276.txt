Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (17, 15) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three edges are nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 42 3-stars. So, the final count is [42].

Listing the unique 3-stars we found:
