Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 2) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 12) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (13, 15, 2)>, 
<3, (11, 3, 15)>,
<4, (17, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (18, 7, 14)>, 
<8, (13, 8, 2)>, 
<9, (9, 4, 10)>, 
<10, (19, 10, 12)>, 
<11, (19, 11, 16)>, 
<12, (12, 2, 5)>,
<13, (13, 15, 2)>, 
<14, (0, 14, 7)>, 
<15, (15, 3, 13)>, 
<17, (1, 17, 4)>, 
<18, (18, 8, 1)>, 
<19, (19, 10, 2)>
