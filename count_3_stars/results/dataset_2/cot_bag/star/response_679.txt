Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4, 8, 13  
Node 1: 5, 3, 11, 13, 8  
Node 2: 5, 12, 13, 14  
Node 3: 1, 10, 12  
Node 4: 7, 0, 10  
Node 5: 6, 2, 1, 10  
Node 6: 5, 9, 14, 7, 11, 12  
Node 7: 4, 6, 10  
Node 8: 1, 14, 11, 0,  
Node 9: 6, 11, 14, 12  
Node 10: 5, 3, 4, 7  
Node 11: 9, 6, 1, 8  
Node 12: 9, 6, 3, 2  
Node 13: 1, 2, 0, 14  
Node 14: 9, 6, 2, 8, 13  

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 5: [<5, (6, 2, 1)>]  
Node 1: [<1, (5, 3, 11)>, <1, (5, 13, 8)>]  
Node 2: [<2, (5, 12, 13)>]  
Node 6: [<6, (5, 9, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 11)>, <6, (5, 12, 6)>, <6, (9, 14, 7)>, <6, (9, 11, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 11)>]  
Node 3: [<3, (1, 10, 12)>]  
Node 4: [<4, (7, 10, 0)>]  
Node 7: [<7, (4, 10, 6)>]  
Node 0: [<0, (4, 8, 13)>]  
Node 9: [<9, (6, 14, 2)>, <9, (6, 11, 7)>, <9, (6, 12, 14)>, <9, (11, 14, 8)>]  
Node 10: [<10, (5, 3, 4)>]  
Node 8: [<8, (1, 14, 11)>]  
Node 11: [<11, (9, 6, 1)>]  
Node 12: [<12, (9, 6, 3)>]  
Node 13: [<13, (1, 14, 8)>]  
Node 14: [<14, (9, 6, 2)>]  

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of [13].
