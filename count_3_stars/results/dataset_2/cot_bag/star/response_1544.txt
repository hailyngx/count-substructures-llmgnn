Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, let's count the number of neighbors it has:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

The nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

So, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
