Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 8), (9, 1), (9, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 0), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 9), (0, 5)

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7.

For node 0: it has neighbors {4, 7, 1, 9, 5}. We can form 3-stars with {4, 7, 1}, {4, 7, 9}, {4, 7, 5}, {4, 1, 9}, {4, 1, 5}, {4, 9, 5}, and thus total 6 3-stars.

For node 1: it has neighbors {4, 7, 3, 5, 9, 0}. We can form 3-stars with {4, 7, 3}, {4, 7, 5}, {4, 7, 9}, {4, 3, 5}, {4, 3, 9}, {4, 5, 9}, and thus total 6 3-stars.

For node 2: it has neighbors {7, 3, 6, 5, 8}. We can form 3-stars with {7, 3, 6}, {7, 3, 5}, {7, 3, 8}, {7, 6, 5}, {7, 6, 8}, {7, 5, 8}, and thus total 6 3-stars.

For node 4: it has neighbors {7, 0, 1, 6, 3}. We can form 3-stars with {7, 0, 1}, {7, 0, 6}, {7, 0, 3}, {7, 1, 6}, {7, 1, 3}, {7, 6, 3}, and thus total 6 3-stars.

For node 7: it has neighbors {4, 0, 2, 8, 1}. We can form 3-stars with {4, 0, 2}, {4, 0, 8}, {4, 0, 1}, {4, 2, 8}, {4, 2, 1}, {4, 8, 1}, and thus total 6 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 30. So, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>
