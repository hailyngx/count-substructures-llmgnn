Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's first identify such nodes:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 3, 5)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (4, 7, 1)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (7, 13, 8, 1, 3, 2)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (10, 11, 2, 12, 14)

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 33. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 7, 5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 1)>
- <4, (7, 13, 8)>
- <9, (10, 11, 2)>
- <4, (7, 13, 1)>
- <4, (13, 8, 1)>
- <9, (10, 11, 14)>
- <9, (10, 12, 2)>
- <9, (11, 12, 14)>
