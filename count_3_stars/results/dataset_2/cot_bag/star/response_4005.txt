Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 5 => forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 5)>, <0, (1, 8, 5)>, <0, (7, 8, 5)>, <0, (1, 7, 6)>, <0, (1, 8, 6)>, <0, (7, 8, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (7, 5, 6)>, <0, (8, 5, 6)>

Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7 => forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>

Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7 => forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<2, (1, 3, 7)>

Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9 => forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<3, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 9 => forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7 => forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>

Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 5, 8 => forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<6, (0, 5, 8)>

Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9 => forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9 => forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8 => forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding all the 3-stars found above, we get a total of [10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 46 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
