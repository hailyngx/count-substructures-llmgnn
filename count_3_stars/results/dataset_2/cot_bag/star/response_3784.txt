Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors.

From the given information, we can see the following neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8 (degree = 3)
- Node 7: 3, 5 (degree = 2)
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6 (degree = 4)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (degree = 6)

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing up these values: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
