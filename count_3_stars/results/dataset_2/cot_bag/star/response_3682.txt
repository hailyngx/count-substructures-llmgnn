Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 15) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more edges connected to them: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19}. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
  
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
  
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
9. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
10. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
11. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  
12. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
