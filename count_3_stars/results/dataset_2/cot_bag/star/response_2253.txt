Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are 3, 15, 12, 2, 1, 10, 16, 17, 14, 19, 6, 18, 5, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Thus, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (2, 5, 19)>, <15, (2, 3, 12)>, <12, (1, 15, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 15)>, <1, (12, 6, 18)>, 
<10, (0, 4, 14)>, <16, (0, 5, 17)>, <17, (4, 5, 16)>, <14, (10, 16, 19)>, <19, (6, 13, 14)>, 
<6, (13, 17, 18)>, <18, (0, 11, 13)>, <5, (3, 16, 17)>, <13, (6, 18, 19)>.
