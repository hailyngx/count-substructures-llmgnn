Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 7
2: 9, 7, 8, 2
3: 5, 7, 1, 6, 0
4: 7, 8, 1
5: 9, 6, 1, 3
6: 5, 3
7: 4, 3, 1, 8, 2
8: 4, 7, 2, 0
9: 5, 2, 1, 0
0: 9, 3, 8, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [61]. The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 0)>.
