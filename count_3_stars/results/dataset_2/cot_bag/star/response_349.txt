Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars using the method described.

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it forms. Here are the calculations for each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = 10
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33].
