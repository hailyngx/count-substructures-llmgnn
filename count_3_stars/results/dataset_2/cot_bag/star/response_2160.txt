Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms inom{4}{3}= 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding all these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are [46] total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

- <2, 13, 1, 27>
- <2, 13, 4, 3>
- <2, 13, 1, 11>
- <7, 21, 4, 12>
- <7, 21, 4, 3>
- <7, 21, 28, 9>
- <7, 21, 28, 25>
- <9, 6, 12, 24>
- <9, 6, 25, 28>
- <9, 25, 28, 26>
- <9, 25, 28, 21>
- <12, 29, 27, 16>
- <15, 19, 17, 11>
