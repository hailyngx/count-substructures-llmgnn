Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 15) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 17) (16, 19) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (10, 3) (10, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this specific graph are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), and then sum them up.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these values, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 40.

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 18], [0, 7, 4], [0, 9, 12], [2, 0, 18], [2, 8, 9], [2, 18, 13], [4, 1, 13], [4, 6, 12], [4, 7, 14], [6, 3, 13], [6, 4, 18], [7, 4, 14], [7, 15, 11], [9, 0, 12], [9, 8, 10], [13, 1, 14], [13, 15, 18], [15, 7, 11], [15, 13, 18]> 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
