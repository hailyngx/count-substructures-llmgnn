Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 12) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 21) (6, 22) (6, 19) (28, 7) (28, 22) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (21, 20) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 27) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 5) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 17) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 14) (0, 15) (0, 23) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 16) (1, 20) (1, 19) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 14) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 25) (24, 2) (24, 14) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 11) (23, 4) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 14) (27, 8) (27, 17) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 23) (17, 26) (17, 27) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph, which are nodes 2, 4, 9, 15, 19, 22, 23, 26, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 41 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (13, 24, 29)>, <2, (10, 13, 29)>, <2, (10, 24, 29)>,
<4, (9, 18, 23)>, <4, (9, 18, 16)>, <4, (9, 16, 13)>, <4, (18, 16, 13)>,
<9, (4, 23, 29)>, <9, (4, 18, 29)>, <9, (4, 18, 16)>, <9, (18, 16, 29)>,
<15, (0, 19, 26)>, <15, (0, 19, 6)>, <15, (0, 19, 7)>,
<19, (1, 7, 20)>, <19, (1, 7, 15)>, <19, (6, 7, 15)>, <19, (6, 7, 20)>,
<22, (6, 11, 28)>, <23, (0, 4, 14)>, <23, (0, 4, 24)>, <23, (0, 4, 25)>, <23, (4, 14, 25)>,
<26, (10, 15, 17)>, <29, (2, 12, 29)>
