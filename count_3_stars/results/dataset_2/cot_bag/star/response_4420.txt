Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: (6)
- 1: (3, 5, 7, 8)
- 2: (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- 3: (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- 4: (2, 3, 7, 8)
- 5: (1, 3, 7)
- 6: (0, 2, 3)
- 7: (1, 2, 4, 5, 8)
- 8: (1, 2, 4, 7)
- 9: (0, 2, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 47.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [47].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
