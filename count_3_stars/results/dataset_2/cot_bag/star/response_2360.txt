Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 21) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (2, 3) (2, 29) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 25) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 26) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 28) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 28) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (26, 17) (26, 21) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 5) (12, 14) (12, 23) (21, 11) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 22) (20, 17) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 18) (27, 22) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (19, 8) (19, 13) (24, 1) (22, 21) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 0) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 23) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with different numbers of neighbors in the given graph. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable central node:

1. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = [10]
   <3, (2, 7, 15)>
  
2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
   <4, (0, 5, 25)>
  
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
   <5, (4, 6, 28)>
  
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
   <8, (9, 11, 13)>
  
5. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = [10]
   <9, (8, 10, 17)>
  
6. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
   <11, (8, 10, 21)>
  
7. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
   <13, (8, 19, 28)>
  
8. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
   <14, (12, 13, 17)>
  
9. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
   <15, (1, 3, 29)>
  
10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
    <17, (9, 14, 26)>
  
11. Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars = [10]
    <21, (5, 11, 26)>
  
12. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
    <22, (0, 21, 25)>
  
13. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
    <23, (0, 3, 12)>
   
14. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = [4]
    <25, (0, 22, 29)>
  
15. Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
    <28, (5, 13, 29)>

Adding up all these results, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
