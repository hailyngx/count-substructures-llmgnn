Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 8, 13, 2, 10, 3, 7, 14, 1, 12, 11

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (2, 4, 11)>
- <9, (3, 1, 5)>
- <4, (5, 9, 11)>
- <8, (0, 3, 13)>
- <13, (3, 10, 12)>
- <2, (5, 3, 10)>
- <10, (0, 12, 13)>
- <3, (9, 13, 2)>
- <7, (5, 1, 6)>
- <14, (1, 2, 12)>
- <1, (5, 7, 14)>
- <12, (10, 1, 14)>
