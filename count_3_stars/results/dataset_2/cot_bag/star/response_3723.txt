Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56]. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
