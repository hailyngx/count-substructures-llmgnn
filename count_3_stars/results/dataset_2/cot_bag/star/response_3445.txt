Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 2, 5, 13, 19
- Node 1: neighbors 8, 11, 14
- Node 4: neighbors 3, 18, 19
- Node 5: neighbors 0, 12, 13, 17
- Node 7: neighbors 11, 17, 19
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 9, 10, 17
- Node 12: neighbors 5, 11, 15, 18, 19
- Node 16: neighbors 15, 18

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 25 3-stars in the given graph.

Thus, the final count is [25], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 19)>
- <0, (5, 13, 19)>
- <0, (5, 12, 19)>
- <0, (5, 17, 19)>
- <1, (8, 11, 14)>
- <4, (3, 18, 19)>
- <5, (0, 12, 13)>
- <7, (11, 17, 19)>
- <8, (1, 9, 17)>
- <12, (5, 11, 15)>
- <12, (5, 11, 18)>
- <12, (5, 15, 18)>
- <12, (11, 15, 18)>
- <12, (11, 15, 19)>
- <16, (15, 18, 0)>
- <16, (15, 18, 4)>

- <16, (15, 4, 19)>
- <16, (15, 7, 12)>
- <16, (15, 7, 19)>
- <16, (15, 12, 19)>
