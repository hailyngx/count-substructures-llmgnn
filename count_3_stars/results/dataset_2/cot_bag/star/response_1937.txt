Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so there are 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 69 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 11, 12)>, <0, (7, 12, 13)>, <0, (11, 12, 13)>, <0, (11, 12, 14)>, <2, (5, 6, 12)>, <2, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (7, 9, 13)>, <5, (1, 9, 10)>, <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <5, (6, 9, 10)>, <5, (9, 10, 13)>, <6, (2, 5, 10)>, <6, (2, 3, 10)>, <7, (0, 13, 14)>, <8, (5, 7, 13)>, <9, (4, 14, 9)>, <10, (5, 12, 13)>, <10, (6, 12, 13)>, <10, (12, 13, 14)>, <13, (0, 7, 11)>
