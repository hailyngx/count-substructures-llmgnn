Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 64\) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
