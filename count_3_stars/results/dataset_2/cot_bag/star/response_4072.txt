Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 25) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 28) (9, 21) (9, 5) (9, 7) (7, 22) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 0) (28, 5) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (17, 11) (29, 1) (29, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 26) (26, 3) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 0) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (23, 28) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 0) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 2) (27, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 20) (14, 18) (14, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 20) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 24) (20, 8) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (10, 29) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 25) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3:
- Node 3 has neighbors 11, 26, and 8. So there is one 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (11, 26, 8)>

Node 5:
- Node 5 has neighbors 15, 9, and 24. So there is one 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (15, 9, 24)>

Node 18:
- Node 18 has neighbors 22, 4, and 19. So there is one 3-star with node 18 as the center: <18, (22, 4, 19)>

Node 22:
- Node 22 has neighbors 18, 16, and 7. So there is one 3-star with node 22 as the center: <22, (18, 16, 7)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 has neighbors 21, 5, and 7. So there is one 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (21, 5, 7)>

Node 28:
- Node 28 has neighbors 5, 6, and 8. So there is one 3-star with node 28 as the center: <28, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 has neighbors 18, 6, and 19. So there is one 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (18, 6, 19)>

Node 24:
- Node 24 has neighbors 5, 6, and 20. So there is one 3-star with node 24 as the center: <24, (5, 6, 20)>

Counting the 3-stars from each of these nodes, we have a total of 8 3-stars in this graph, which we will put inside brackets: [8].
