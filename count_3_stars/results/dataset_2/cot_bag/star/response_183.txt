Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 1: 1 3-star
- For Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 10 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 3) + 4 (Node 4) + 10 (Node 6) + 10 (Node 8) + 10 (Node 9) = 49

So, the total number of 3-stars is [49].

Unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
