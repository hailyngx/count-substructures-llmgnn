Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees greater than or equal to 3 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 12)>, <4, (0, 3, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (9, 12, 13)>, <8, (1, 9, 13)>, <9, (8, 10, 7)>, <10, (6, 9, 14)>, <12, (7, 2, 14)>, <13, (6, 7, 8)>
