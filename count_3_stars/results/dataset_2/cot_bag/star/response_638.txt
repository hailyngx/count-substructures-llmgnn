Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 13)>
<0, (2, 4, 10)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 11)>
<1, (5, 14, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 10)>
<3, (0, 5, 13)>
<4, (0, 2, 10)>
<5, (3, 6, 14)>
<6, (3, 5, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 11)>
<9, (5, 13, 14)>
