- Node 4 has neighbors: 13, 8, 23, 14.
- Node 5 has neighbors: 26, 23.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 16, 29, 17.
- Node 7 has no neighbors.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 21, 20, 24.
- Node 10 has neighbors: 21, 26.
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 14, 12.
- Node 12 has neighbors: 11, 0.
- Node 13 has neighbors: 22, 4.
- Node 14 has neighbors: 11, 4.
- Node 15 has neighbors: 29, 25, 26, 24.
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 0, 6.
- Node 17 has neighbors: 6, 27.
- Node 18 has neighbors: 22, 19.
- Node 19 has neighbors: 18, 25, 28, 23.
- Node 20 has neighbors: 2, 29, 3, 9, 23.
- Node 21 has neighbors: 1, 10, 27, 9.
- Node 22 has neighbors: 13, 18, 4, 28, 3, 24.
- Node 23 has neighbors: 4, 5, 19, 20, 24.
- Node 24 has neighbors: 22, 15, 9, 23.
- Node 25 has neighbors: 19, 15.
- Node 26 has neighbors: 5, 10, 15, 27.
- Node 27 has neighbors: 21, 26, 17.
- Node 28 has neighbors: 22, 0, 19.
- Node 29 has neighbors: 1, 20, 6, 15.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars.

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 20: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 22: [3]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 24: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 27: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

Therefore, there are a total of $ 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17 $ 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (16, 28, 12)>, <1, (21, 29, 2)>, <1, (21, 29, 9)>, <4, (13, 8, 23)>, <9, (1, 21, 20)>, <11, (16, 14, 12)>, <13, (22, 4, 18)>, <15, (29,25,26)>, <16, (11,0,6)>, <20, (2, 29, 3)>, <21, (1, 10, 27)>, <22, (13, 18, 4)>, <22, (13, 22, 3)>, <22, (22, 28, 24)>, <24, (22, 23, 15)>, <26, (5, 10, 15)>, <27, (21, 26, 17)>.
