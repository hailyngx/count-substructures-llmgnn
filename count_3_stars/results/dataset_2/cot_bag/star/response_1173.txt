13: 8, 16, 24, 7  
3: 25, 7, 14  
25: 3, 14  
12: 1, 10, 29  
4: 8, 22, 17  
2: 22  
18: 5, 28  
19: 29, 7, 14  
26: 6, 23, 16  
11: 28, 22, 17, 15  
10: 12, 15, 29  
15: 11, 10, 22, 5  
22: 4, 2, 11, 15

14: 21, 3, 25, 19  
16: 6, 13, 26, 23, 17  
17: 4, 11, 5, 16  
20: 8, 24  
24: 1, 9, 13, 20  

In this graph, the potential 3-stars are: 

- Node 1: [2] 3-stars
- Node 6: [3] 3-stars
- Node 8: [3] 3-stars
- Node 9: [2] 3-stars
- Node 11: [1] 3-star
- Node 12: [2] 3-stars
- Node 13: [2] 3-stars
- Node 15: [3] 3-stars
- Node 16: [4] 3-stars
- Node 17: [1] 3-star
- Node 22: [2] 3-stars
- Node 23: [1] 3-star
- Node 26: [1] 3-star
- Node 29: [1] 3-star

Adding these up gives us a total of [27] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (29, 12, 24)>
<6, (9, 26, 16)>
<8, (9, 13, 20)>
<9, (6, 8, 24)>
<12, (1, 10, 29)>
<13, (8, 16, 24)>
<15, (10, 22, 29)>
<16, (6, 13, 26)>
<17, (4, 11, 5)>
<22, (4, 11, 15)>
<23, (21, 26, 5)>
<26, (6, 23, 16)>
<29, (1, 19, 10)>
