Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 23) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 28) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 27) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 24) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 21) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 24) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 10) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 17) (2, 16) (2, 26) (2, 1) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (28, 0) (28, 23) (24, 15) (24, 25) (24, 21) (24, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (29, 25) (29, 8) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 1) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 4) 

Response:
The node degrees for this graph are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 10 has degree 3
Node 11 has degree 3
Node 12 has degree 2
Node 14 has degree 4
Node 15 has degree 4
Node 16 has degree 4
Node 17 has degree 4
Node 18 has degree 3
Node 19 has degree 3
Node 20 has degree 3
Node 21 has degree 3
Node 22 has degree 2
Node 23 has degree 3
Node 24 has degree 4
Node 25 has degree 5
Node 26 has degree 4
Node 27 has degree 3
Node 28 has degree 2
Node 29 has degree 3

There are 6 nodes with degrees higher than 2, which are nodes 15, 16, 17, 24, 25, and 26. 
Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<15, (6, 14, 27)>, <15, (6, 14, 24)>, <15, (9, 6, 20)>, <15, (14, 27, 3)>, <16, (2, 26, 17)>, <16, (21, 24, 8)>, <16, (8, 24, 25)>, <16, (21, 24, 15)>, <17, (26, 11, 17)>, <17, (23, 22, 25)>, <17, (11, 17, 4)>, <17, (23, 17, 4)>, <24, (15, 25, 27)>, <24, (21, 24, 8)>, <24, (14, 27, 3)>, <24, (21, 24, 15)>, <25, (24, 8, 29)>, <25, (27, 3, 15)>, <25, (24, 15, 25)>, <25, (24, 21, 16)>, <26, (7, 12, 16)>, <26, (2, 1, 14)>, <26, (2, 16, 21)>, <26, (7, 12, 16)>, <15, (6, 14, 27)>
