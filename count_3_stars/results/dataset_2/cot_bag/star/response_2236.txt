Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 8, 2
- Node 1: 7, 9, 3
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9, 0
- Node 3: 6, 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 7, 2, 9, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 3
- Node 6: 4, 5, 3, 2, 0
- Node 7: 4, 1, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9, 3, 0
- Node 9: 4, 8, 2, 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding them up, we get a total of: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45] and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- <1, (7, 9, 3)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 1, 5)>
- <4, (7, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 3)>
- <6, (4, 5, 3)>
- <7, (4, 1, 8)>
- <8, (7, 9, 3)>
- <9, (4, 8, 2)>
