Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 2) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 10, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<7, (6, 5, 8)>
<10, (1, 2, 11)>
<10, (0, 1, 9)>
<10, (5, 9, 11)>
<10, (5, 9, 14)>
<10, (2, 11, 14)>
<13, (3, 6, 14)>
<13, (3, 6, 7)>
<13, (3, 6, 9)>
<13, (6, 7, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 9)>
<13, (6, 9, 14)>
<13, (7, 9, 14)>
<13, (6, 9, 14)>

These are the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
