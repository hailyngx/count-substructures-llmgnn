Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes, edges, and neighbors:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 11), (5, 3), (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 0), (4, 6)
(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 13), (7, 8), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 12), (3, 5), (3, 7)
(3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 8), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 11), (8, 12), (13, 4), (13, 7)
(13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 14), (10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 2), (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 8)
(11, 13), (11, 2), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 12), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 12), (0, 2), (14, 13)
(14, 2), (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 0), (2, 14), (12, 1), (12, 8), (12, 10), (12, 6), (12, 0)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For each node, let's check how many neighbors it has:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 85 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 85. 
Thus, the final answer is [85].
