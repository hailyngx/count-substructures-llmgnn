Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5).
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8).
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 6).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5).
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7, 8).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8).
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 9).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (6, 8).

From the analysis above, only nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, which are necessary to form 3-stars. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
