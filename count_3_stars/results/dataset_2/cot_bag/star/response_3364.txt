Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 11) (7, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 19) (10, 18) (17, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
