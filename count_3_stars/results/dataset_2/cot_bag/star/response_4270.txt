Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
4. Node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
6. Node 6: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
7. Node 8: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
8. Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 3-stars in total, which can be represented by the following unique 3-stars:

\[ \text{[44]} \]
<1, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 6)>, <5, (9, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 3)>, <6, (5, 2, 7)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 2, 6)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 1, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 3)>, <6, (7, 1, 3)>
