Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars in this graph.  
So, the final answer is [48].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 8, 1)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (5, 1, 3)>
