Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 27) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 7) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 13) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 18) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 17) (26, 28) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 24) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 17) (6, 10) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 27) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 4) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 11) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 5) (22, 2) (22, 12) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 20) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 8) (23, 17) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 10) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 11) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 25) (12, 1) (12, 22) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 27, 16, 29, 19
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 13, 12, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 18, 22, 13
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 21, 9, 17, 11
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 29, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 27, 21, 9, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 18, 8, 25, 4
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 25
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 18, 14, 4, 20
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 17
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 15, 21, 11
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 0, 29, 5
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 18, 13, 23, 4
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 2, 29, 9, 11, 17
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 0, 28, 25
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 3, 26, 11
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 8, 14, 4
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors: 2, 12
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors: 15, 28
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 9, 19, 10
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 3, 0, 8
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 26, 19, 24
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 16, 18

Next, calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

\[
[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} ] = [107]
\]

So, there are a total of 107 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them now:
