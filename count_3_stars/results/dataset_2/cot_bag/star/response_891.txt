Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 25) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 12) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 14) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 3) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 28) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 29) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 27) (18, 27) (18, 25) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 24) (5, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 16) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 15) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (12, 2) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 23) (27, 19) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (9, 0) (9, 3) (24, 22) (24, 5) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 10) (25, 16) (23, 7) (23, 20) (3, 22) (3, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 20: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 29: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 66.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (14, 25, 18)>, <2, (14, 12, 26)>, <2, (14, 0, 25)>, <2, (14, 28, 1)>, <2, (14, 28, 6)>, <5, (4, 22, 24)>, <5, (4, 22, 12)>, <5, (4, 11, 14)>, <6, (28, 21, 13)>, <12, (2, 15, 16)>, <13, (29, 17, 27)>, <13, (29, 17, 18)>, <13, (29, 27, 18)>, <13, (21, 28, 6)>, <13, (21, 28, 14)>, <13, (21, 28, 1)>, <16, (15, 2, 12)>, <16, (15, 2, 25)>, <20, (27, 19, 26)>, <20, (27, 19, 27)>.
