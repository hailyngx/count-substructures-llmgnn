Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 15) (19, 18) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 2: There are 6 possible 3-stars.
- For node 3: There is only 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 4: There is only 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 5: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 6: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 7: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 8: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 9: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 10: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 11: There is only 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 12: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 13: There is only 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 14: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 15: There are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For node 16: There are 6 possible 3-stars.
- For node 17: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 18: There are 3 possible 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 9, 17>, 
<1, 15, 19>, 
<2, 1, 8>, 
<2, 1, 10>, 
<2, 16, 4>, 
<2, 16, 15>, 
<2, 16, 1>, 
<3, 7, 13>, 
<4, 16, 15>, 
<5, 7, 3>, 
<5, 7, 6>, 
<5, 14, 4>, 
<6, 8, 10>, 
<7, 5, 17>, 
<8, 1, 2>, 
<9, 11, 17>, 
<10, 2, 12>, 
<11, 16, 4>, 
<12, 3, 7>, 
<12, 10, 14>, 
<15, 16, 1>, 
<18, 6, 7>
