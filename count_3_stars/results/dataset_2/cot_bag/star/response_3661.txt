Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 71 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
