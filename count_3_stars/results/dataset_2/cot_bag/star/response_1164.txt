Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 13
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9, 12, 13
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9, 11
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 14
- Node 7: 0, 8, 10, 11
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 13
- Node 10: 7, 13, 14
- Node 11: 4, 5, 7, 12, 14
- Node 12: 2, 4, 6, 11
- Node 13: 0, 2, 9, 10
- Node 14: 4, 6, 10, 11

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [90].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 13, 2)>, <2, (0, 9, 13)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <5, (4, 11, 6)>, <6, (8, 4, 12)>, <7, (8, 11, 10)>, <9, (3, 2, 13)>, <11, (7, 4, 14)>, <12, (6, 2, 4)>, <13, (0, 2, 10)>, <14, (10, 6, 4)>
