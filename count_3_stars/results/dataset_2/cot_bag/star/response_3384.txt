Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 11) (0, 21) (0, 14) (0, 9) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 16) (20, 3) (20, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 18) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 13) (23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 29) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 24) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 26) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 14) (28, 21) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 5) (14, 0) (14, 25) (14, 6) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 2) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 17) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 12) (26, 16) (24, 13) (24, 17) (4, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 20) (9, 10) (9, 28) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 15) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 15) (15, 3) (15, 16) (2, 17) (5, 1) (5, 27) (5, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Adding these up: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 6, 8)> <6, (1, 14, 25)> <8, (1, 13, 16)> <10, (9, 11, 29)> 
<11, (21, 10, 18)> <12, (4, 19, 26)> <13, (8, 17, 24)> 
<14, (0, 6, 25)> <18, (9, 11, 21)> <21, (11, 0, 28)> 
<23, (8, 25, 29)> <25, (6, 14, 28)> <26, (10, 12, 16)> 
<28, (6, 9, 25)> <29, (10, 17, 23)>
