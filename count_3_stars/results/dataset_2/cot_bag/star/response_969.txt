Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3} = 20]

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60.

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
