Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 14) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (0, 20) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 28) (28, 20) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 25) (29, 6) (14, 21) (14, 5) (10, 21) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 3) (17, 25) (17, 10) (17, 6) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (27, 28) (27, 22) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 4) (15, 24) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 29) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (24, 16) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 14) (5, 2) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 11) (11, 9) (11, 22) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (15, 21, 23)>, <3, (5, 17, 25)>, <5, (2, 3, 28)>, <6, (16, 17, 22)>, <10, (17, 21, 24)>, <12, (16, 18, 26)>, <15, (1, 4, 24)>, <16, (6, 12, 24)>, <17, (3, 6, 25)>, <18, (9, 12, 21)>, <20, (0, 3, 28)>, <21, (10, 14, 18)>, <22, (6, 11, 27)>
