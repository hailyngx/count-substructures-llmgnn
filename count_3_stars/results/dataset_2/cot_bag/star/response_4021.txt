Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 0, 2, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in this graph.

Putting them in brackets: [45]

The unique 3-stars are:
