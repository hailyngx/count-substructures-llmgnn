Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 10
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 11, 13
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 11
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 13
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, 12, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 10, 13, 14
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 10, 14
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, 9, 12
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 14
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 10
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 12
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 10, 11

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4, 6-stars: 
  - Total 3-stars: [20]
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (8, 10, 14)>, <6, (0, 8, 12)>, <6, (3, 7, 12)>, <6, (8, 10, 14)>, <6, (10, 12, 14)>

- Node 8, 5-stars: 
  - Total 3-stars: [10]
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 10, 13)>

- Node 6, 6-stars: 
  - Total 3-stars: [15]
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 7, 12)>, <6, (0, 8, 14)>, <6, (3, 6, 12)>, <6, (3, 12, 14)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [20 + 10 + 15] = [45]
