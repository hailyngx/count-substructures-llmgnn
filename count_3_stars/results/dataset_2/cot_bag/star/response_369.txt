Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, namely nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 16, and 25. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 12, 23, and 24. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 10, 11, 21, and 25. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 8, 11, 17, 18, and 26. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: nodes 11, 15, 22, 23, and 28. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 8, and 18. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
7. Node 11 has 5 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 6, 13, and 26. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 9, and 29. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
9. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: nodes 6, 21, and 24. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
10. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: nodes 18, 27, and 28. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
11. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: nodes 9, 10, and 5. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
12. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: nodes 7, 9, 25, and 27. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: nodes 3, 7, 15, and 25. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 22 has 2 neighbors: nodes 6, and 16. Therefore, it does not contribute to any 3-star.
15. Node 24 has 2 neighbors: nodes 2, and 15. Therefore, it does not contribute to any 3-star.
16. Node 25 has 5 neighbors: nodes 0, 12, 19, 20, and 21. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 26 has 2 neighbors: nodes 5, and 27. Therefore, it does not contribute to any 3-star.
18. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: nodes 17, 20, and 26. Therefore, it contributes 1 3-star.
19. Node 28 has 4 neighbors: nodes 4, 6, 17, and 12. Therefore, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get a total of 53 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
