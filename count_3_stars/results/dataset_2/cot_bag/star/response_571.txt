Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (7, 8, 1, 6)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (7, 8, 6, 2)
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: (4, 8, 5, 1, 3, 2)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4, 0, 9, 5, 1)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (4, 5, 0, 6)

Calculating \( {5 \choose 3} + {4 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 3} + {5 \choose 3} + {4 \choose 3} = 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<7, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 1)>
<6, (8, 5, 4)>
<6, (8, 5, 2)>
<6, (8, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
