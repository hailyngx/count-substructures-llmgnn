Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 7
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 9, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7, 5, 2
- Node 5: 6, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 9, 5, 8, 4, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 6, 3, 1, 0

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars for each node: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 8, 9)>.
