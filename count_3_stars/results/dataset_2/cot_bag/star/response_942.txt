Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (1, 19) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 4) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 10) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for Nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Nodes 6, 7, 12, 13, 19, 
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for Nodes 11, 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( [1+4+1] = 6 \).

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 15)>
<6, (12, 16, 19)>
<7, (12, 16, 17)>
<11, (4, 13, 18)>
<12, (6, 7, 13)>
<19, (1, 3, 4)>
