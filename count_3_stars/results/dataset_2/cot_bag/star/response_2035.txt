Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (9, 6, 8, 13), so it can form 4 3-stars: [(0, 9, 6), (0, 9, 13), (0, 6, 8), (0, 8, 13)].
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (11, 2, 13, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars: [(1, 11, 2), (1, 11, 13), (1, 2, 8), (1, 8, 13)].
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4, 7, 1), so it can form 4 3-stars: [(2, 5, 4), (2, 5, 7), (2, 4, 1), (2, 1, 7)].
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (5, 8, 10, 2), so it can form 4 3-stars: [(4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 10), (4, 8, 2), (4, 2, 10)].
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (9, 13, 2, 11, 4), so it can form 10 3-stars: [(5, 9, 13), (5, 9, 2), (5, 9, 11), (5, 9, 4), (5, 13, 2), (5, 13, 11), (5, 13, 4), (5, 2, 11), (5, 2, 4), (5, 11, 4)].
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: (4, 7, 1, 11, 0, 12), so it can form 15 3-stars: [(8, 4, 7), (8, 4, 1), (8, 4, 11), (8, 4, 0), (8, 4, 12), (8, 7, 1), (8, 7, 11), (8, 7, 0), (8, 7, 12), (8, 1, 11), (8, 1, 0), (8, 1, 12), (8, 11, 0), (8, 11, 12), (8, 0, 12)].
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: (5, 1, 8, 3, 12, 9), so it can form 15 3-stars: [(11, 5, 1), (11, 5, 8), (11, 5, 3), (11, 5, 12), (11, 5, 9), (11, 1, 8), (11, 1, 3), (11, 1, 12), (11, 1, 9), (11, 8, 3), (11, 8, 12), (11, 8, 9), (11, 3, 12), (11, 3, 9), (11, 12, 9)].
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (5, 7, 1, 12, 0), so it can form 10 3-stars: [(13, 5, 7), (13, 5, 1), (13, 5, 12), (13, 5, 0), (13, 7, 1), (13, 7, 12), (13, 7, 0), (13, 1, 12), (13, 1, 0), (13, 12, 0)].

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 10 = 66.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [66].
