Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <0, (4, 5, 3)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 1)>
   - <0, (4, 3, 1)>
   - <0, (5, 3, 1)>

2. Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - <3, (9, 6, 4)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 8)>
   - <3, (9, 4, 8)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 8)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 2)>
   - <3, (9, 8, 2)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 2)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 2)>
   - <3, (6, 2, 8)>
   - <3, (9, 4, 2)>
   - <3, (4, 8, 2)>
   - <3, (9, 4, 0)>
   - <3, (4, 8, 0)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 0)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 0)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 0)>
   - <3, (4, 8, 0)>
   - <3, (9, 8, 0)>
   - <3, (9, 2, 0)>
   - <3, (8, 2, 0)>

3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - <4, (9, 6, 3)>
   - <4, (9, 6, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 3, 0)>
   - <4, (6, 3, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 0, 3)>
   - <4, (6, 0, 3)>
   - <4, (6, 9, 0)>
   - <4, (3, 0, 6)>
   - <4, (3, 9, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 9, 6)>

4. Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - <6, (9, 4, 3)>
   - <6, (9, 4, 2)>
   - <6, (9, 3, 2)>
   - <6, (9, 4, 0)>
   - <6, (9, 3, 0)>
   - <6, (4, 3, 0)>
   - <6, (4, 2, 0)>
   - <6, (3, 2, 0)>
   - <6, (9, 2, 0)>
   - <6, (4, 9, 3)>
   - <6, (4, 9, 0)>
   - <6, (4, 3, 2)>
   - <6, (4, 2, 3)>
   - <6, (3, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (9, 0, 3)>
   - <6, (3, 0, 9)>
   - <6, (9, 0, 4)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <6, (9, 0, 2)>
   - <6, (0, 3, 2)>

5. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 1)>
   - <7, (9, 6, 1)>
   - <7, (5, 9, 1)>

6. Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   - <9, (6, 4, 3)>
   - <9, (6, 3, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 3, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 2)>
   - <9, (4, 8, 2)>
   - <9, (6, 4, 0)>
   - <9, (4, 8, 0)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 0)>
   - <9, (6, 2, 0)>
   - <9, (8, 2, 0)>
   - <9, (6, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (4, 8, 7)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 7)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 4)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 3)>
   - <9, (7, 4, 3)>
   - <9, (7, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20] = 78.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 3)>, <3, (9, 6, 4)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>, <6, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>.
