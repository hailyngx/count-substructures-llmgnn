Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 3) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (3, 16) (3, 19) (7, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 10) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and connections:

Nodes: 1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 11, 10, 13, 12, 15, 14, 17, 16, 19, 18

Edges:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 17, 15, 16
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 10
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 19, 14, 11
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 14, 1
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 14
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 17
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 16
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 19
- Node 13 is connected to node 19
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 18, 0
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 11
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 18, 1, 3
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 18, 0, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 2, 11, 12
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 15, 13, 3, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 16, 19
- Node 7 is connected to node 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 10
- Node 6 is connected to node 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 18 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 15 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 17 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 11 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 14 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 19 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 10 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6 forms inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 7 forms inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 12 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 13 forms inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 0 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 52

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [52] and they are:
<5, (9, 2, 17)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<4, (8, 19, 14)>
<8, (9, 4, 14)>
<2, (5, 1, 14)>
<18, (11, 16, 17)>
<1, (8, 2, 16)>
<17, (5, 18, 0)>
<16, (5, 18, 1)>
<11, (4, 18, 14)>
<14, (4, 8, 11)>
<19, (4, 15, 13)>
<10, (9, 7, 12)>
