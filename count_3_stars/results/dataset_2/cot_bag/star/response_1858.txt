Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 18) (16, 6) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 41

So, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 5, 14)>, 
<3, (8, 13, 17)>, 
<4, (8, 10, 12)>, 
<5, (2, 10, 19)>, 
<6, (7, 11, 16)>, 
<7, (11, 18, 19)>, 
<12, (4, 13, 15)>, 
<13, (5, 12, 15)>, 
<15, (9, 13, 18)>, 
<17, (3, 12, 5)>, 
<18, (3, 15, 7)>
