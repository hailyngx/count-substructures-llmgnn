The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 11) (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 8) (5, 21) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 11) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 13) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 2) (28, 16) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 23) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 15) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 25) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 15) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 1) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (18, 23) (18, 0) (23, 20) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 3) (13, 7) (13, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) 

Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<0, (9, 4, 17)>, <0, (9, 18, 17)>, <0, (9, 29, 17)>, <0, (9, 4, 29)>, <0, (29, 4, 17)>, <0, (22, 4, 17)>, <0, (22, 29, 17)>, <0, (4, 22, 29)>, <0, (4, 18, 17)>, <0, (18, 23, 17)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
<1, (11, 14, 10)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<2, (29, 3, 20)>, <2, (29, 14, 28)>, <2, (3, 20, 17)>, <2, (3, 10, 17)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<3, (20, 17, 23)>, <3, (20, 10, 17)>, <3, (20, 10, 3)>, <3, (10, 1, 17)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (22, 11, 1)>, <4, (22, 9, 26)>, <4, (22, 9, 0)>, <4, (26, 9, 0)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<8, (12, 24, 20)>, <8, (12, 24, 13)>, <8, (24, 12, 13)>, <8, (24, 26, 12)>, <8, (24, 26, 13)>, <8, (24, 13, 8)>, <8, (24, 13, 15)>, <8, (24, 13, 16)>, <8, (12, 13, 8)>, <8, (24, 13, 14)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<9, (22, 26, 11)>, <9, (22, 4, 17)>, <9, (26, 27, 25)>, <9, (26, 0, 22)>

Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<12, (8, 24, 13)>, <12, (8, 24, 20)>, <12, (24, 13, 8)>, <12, (24, 13, 14)>

Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<15, (25, 27, 15)>, <15, (25, 27, 4)>, <15, (25, 27, 15)>, <15, (19, 15, 16)>

Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<17, (23, 0, 18)>, <17, (23, 20, 3)>, <17, (23, 17, 18)>, <17, (23, 20, 3)>

Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<20, (29, 27, 0)>, <20, (29, 3, 20)>, <20, (8, 14, 24)>, <20, (8, 14, 19)>

Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<22, (26, 11, 1)>, <22, (26, 9, 0)>, <22, (26, 9, 0)>, <22, (11, 1, 14)>

Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<24, (12, 13, 8)>, <24, (12, 13, 14)>, <24, (12, 8, 13)>, <24, (12, 8, 14)>

Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<26, (9, 22, 11)>, <26, (9, 22, 4)>, <26, (9, 0, 27)>, <26, (9, 0, 27)>

Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<29, (2, 3, 20)>, <29, (2, 3, 10)>, <29, (2, 20, 28)>, <29, (2, 14, 28)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found for each node, we get a total of 62 distinct 3-stars forming in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [62].
