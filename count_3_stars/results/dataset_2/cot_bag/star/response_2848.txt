Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 5) (12, 2) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 4) (7, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we start by examining the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Here is the list of such nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 1: {14, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 18}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 11, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 13}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 10}
- Node 16: {9, 11, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 6, 16}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- For nodes with four neighbors: Node 3, Node 9, and Node 11 have exactly 4 neighbors. So, each of these nodes contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- For nodes with five neighbors: Node 6 and Node 17 have exactly 5 neighbors. Each of these nodes contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes mentioned above, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (6, 9, 15)>
<9, (3, 5, 10)>
<11, (4, 6, 13)>
<6, (3, 11, 17)>
<17, (0, 1, 16)>
