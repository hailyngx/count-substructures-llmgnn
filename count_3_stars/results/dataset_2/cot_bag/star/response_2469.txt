Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 15) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 6) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (9, 4) (9, 11) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 10) (16, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 10, 13, 16, 15, 6, 2, 18, 7, 11, 4, 14, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 36 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 10, 18)>, <3, (2, 10, 16)>, <3, (10, 15, 16)>, <3, (10, 12, 16)>, <3, (10, 13, 16)>, <10, (1, 3, 15)>, <10, (3, 15, 16)>, <10, (15, 16, 17)>, <10, (15, 16, 10)>, <13, (8, 15, 16)>, <16, (3, 10, 15)>, <16, (5, 10, 16)>, <15, (7, 10, 13)>, <15, (3, 10, 15)>, <15, (10, 12, 15)>, <15, (10, 13, 15)>, <6, (5, 14, 17)>, <18, (0, 7, 14)>, <18, (1, 7, 14)>, <18, (0, 7, 18)>, <7, (11, 18, 19)>, <7, (14, 18, 7)>, <7, (15, 18, 7)>, <7, (14, 18, 7)>, <11, (4, 9, 19)>, <11, (4, 9, 11)>, <11, (4, 11, 19)>, <11, (4, 9, 11)>, <4, (9, 11, 19)>, <14, (6, 7, 18)>, <14, (7, 18, 14)>, <14, (18, 7, 14)>
