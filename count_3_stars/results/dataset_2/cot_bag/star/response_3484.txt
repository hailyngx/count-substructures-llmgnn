27: 25, 12, 26  
28: 25, 6, 0  
29: 7, 13, 5  

Nodes 21 and 17 do not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star. 

The number of 3-stars formed with the other nodes are as follows:
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [2]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [3]
- Node 6: [3]
- Node 7: [3]
- Node 8: [3]
- Node 9: [4]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [3]
- Node 14: [3]
