Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 19) (8, 12) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 3) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 14) (6, 3) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 11, 18, 0, 14, 1, 13, 12, 3, 6, 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
