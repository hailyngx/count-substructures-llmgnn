Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 7) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 10, 11, 16, 14, 0, 1, 12, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<10, (5, 16, 8)>, <10, (11, 17, 12)>, <10, (11, 17, 2)>, <10, (11, 17, 10)>, <11, (2, 17, 10)>, <11, (14, 17, 12)>, <11, (7, 14, 4)>, <11, (7, 14, 18)>, <16, (7, 10, 8)>, <14, (7, 11, 4)>, <14, (7, 18, 4)>, <0, (18, 19, 3)>, <0, (1, 18, 0)>, <0, (1, 18, 0)>, <0, (2, 19, 3)>, <1, (6, 15, 1)>, <12, (5, 19, 12)>, <12, (9, 17, 12)>, <12, (17, 5, 12)>, <12, (19, 5, 12)>, <5, (2, 12, 5)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <7, (13, 6, 7)>, <8, (16, 10, 8)>, <13, (4, 6, 13)>
