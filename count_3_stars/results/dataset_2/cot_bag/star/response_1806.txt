Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 19) (1, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 10) (11, 15) (11, 0) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

1 -> {19, 8}  
2 -> {18, 5, 13, 6, 7}  
3 -> {10}  
4 -> {15, 14, 5, 10}  
5 -> {2, 0, 4}  
6 -> {2, 18, 10}  
7 -> {2, 12}  
8 -> {17, 1, 12, 19}  
9 -> {14, 18, 16, 10}  
10 -> {3, 6, 9, 4, 13}  
11 -> {15, 0}  
12 -> {14, 7, 16, 8}  
13 -> {2, 10}  
14 -> {17, 9, 4, 12}  
15 -> {4, 11}  
16 -> {12, 9}  
17 -> {14, 8, 18}  
18 -> {17, 2, 9, 6}  
19 -> {1, 8}  

Let's count the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 40 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
