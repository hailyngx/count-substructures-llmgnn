Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (2, 11) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 27) (29, 8) (29, 25) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 26) (25, 11) (25, 29) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (20, 12) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 8) (14, 21) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 13) (9, 22) (9, 17) (21, 14) (21, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 5) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 19) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 1) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 22) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 26) (24, 2) (24, 13) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify these nodes first:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll count the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Total 3-stars for nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16: 8 * 4 = 32
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Total 3-stars for nodes 5 and 6: 2 * 10 = 20
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each
  - Total 3-stars for nodes 11, 13, 17, 22, 23, 25, 28, and 29: 8

Adding these up, we have a total of 32 + 20 + 8 = 60 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 23, 5)>
<5, (4, 15, 10)>
<6, (5, 7, 21)>
<8, (14, 29, 4)>
<9, (13, 22, 17)>
<11, (25, 2, 16)>
<12, (20, 15, 22)>
<15, (0, 5, 12)>
<16, (18, 11, 3)>
<25, (11, 29, 25)>
<26, (6, 27, 12)>
