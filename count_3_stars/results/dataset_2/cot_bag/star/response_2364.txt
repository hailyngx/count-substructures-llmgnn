Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges is represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 1: {3, 6, 5, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 9, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {8, 9}
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 0, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

For Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
For Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
For Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing them up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 1, 9)>, <1, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (1, 6, 5)>, <1, (1, 6, 3)>, <1, (4, 9, 3)>, <1, (4, 9, 6)>, <1, (3, 9, 6)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 3)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 0)>, <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 0, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 8)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>, <9, (9, 0, 7)>, <9, (9, 0, 3)>, <9, (9, 0, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 1)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (7, 0, 9)>
