Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 26) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 18) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 14) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 5) (10, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 26) (0, 2) (0, 29) (20, 29) (20, 1) (9, 22) (9, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (5, 27) (5, 25) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 24) (8, 3) (8, 25) (8, 11) (18, 3) (18, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 15) (26, 4) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (24, 15) (24, 14) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 6) (4, 19) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (25, 8) (28, 2) (28, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 88 \)

Therefore, there are 88 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets: [88].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 16, 21)>, <2, (0, 16, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 21)>, <2, (16, 21, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 18)>, <6, (14, 4, 16)>, <6, (14, 4, 21)>, <6, (14, 4, 24)>, <6, (14, 16, 21)>, <14, (6, 4, 16)>, <14, (6, 4, 21)>, <14, (6, 4, 24)>, <14, (6, 16, 21)>, <15, (10, 7, 26)>, <16, (2, 0, 21)>, <16, (2, 6, 21)>, <17, (10, 9, 26)>, <19, (11, 4, 26)>, <21, (13, 22, 16)>, <22, (13, 21, 23)>, <26, (4, 15, 24)>, <26, (4, 15, 26)>, <26, (4, 19, 11)>, <26, (4, 19, 6)>, <26, (11, 19, 4)>, <29, (2, 0, 20>)
