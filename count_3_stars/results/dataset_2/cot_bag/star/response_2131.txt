Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 11, 1, 6, 10, and 3. 

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10 
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4 
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4

Adding up all the individual 3-stars gives a total of 73. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [73]. 

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
<4, 2, 8>
<7, 1, 6>
<8, 4, 11>
<9, 8, 10>
<12, 3, 9>
<13, 6, 7>
<11, 1, 4>
<1, 0, 11>
<6, 7, 13>
<10, 3, 12>
