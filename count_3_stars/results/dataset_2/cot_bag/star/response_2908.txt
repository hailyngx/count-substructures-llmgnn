Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 5, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 0, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 1, 5, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 5, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 0}

Total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: $C(4, 3) = 4$
- Node 1: $C(5, 3) = 10$
- Node 2: $C(5, 3) = 10$
- Node 4: $C(6, 3) = 20$
- Node 5: $C(4, 3) = 4$
- Node 9: $C(3, 3) = 1$

Adding these up: $4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 49$

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<0, (9, 3, 4)>
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<0, (3, 2, 4)>

<4, (6, 5, 0)>
<4, (6, 5, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>

<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (8, 0, 4)>
