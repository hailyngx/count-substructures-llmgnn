Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 62

Thus, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 4, 12)>, <5, (8, 10, 12)>, <5, (8, 10, 13)>, <5, (8, 10, 7)>, <5, (8, 7, 13)>, <5, (10, 12, 14)>, <5, (12, 6, 13)>, <7, (0, 10, 13)>
