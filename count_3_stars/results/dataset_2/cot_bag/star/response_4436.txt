Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3}

Based on the number of neighbors of each node, we can determine how many 3-stars are formed with each central node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [57].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
(7, 1, 8)
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
