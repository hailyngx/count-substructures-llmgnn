Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 also has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 11 has 6 neighbors, forming \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 13 has 6 neighbors, forming \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed in the graph: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
