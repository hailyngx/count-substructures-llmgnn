Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 2
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 3
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of 3 or more:

For Node 0, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [4]. 
<0, (8, 14, 12)>

For Node 2, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = [14]. 
<2, (7, 3, 13)>  <2, (7, 13, 11)>  <2, (7, 10, 13)>  <2, (3, 1, 13)>  <2, (3, 6, 13)>  <2, (3, 11, 13)>  <2, (1, 3, 13)>  <2, (1, 8, 13)>  <2, (1, 13, 11)>  <2, (1, 13, 10)>  <2, (13, 3, 11)>  <2, (13, 3, 10)>  <2, (13, 11, 10)>  <2, (11, 13, 10)>

For Node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [18]. 
<3, (1, 6, 2)>  <3, (1, 2, 13)>  <3, (1, 13, 11)>  <3, (6, 7, 4)> 

For Node 4, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [22]. 
<4, (9, 7, 0)>  <4, (9, 7, 6)>  <4, (9, 0, 8)>  <4, (7, 9, 1)>

For Node 5, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = [32]. 
<5, (9, 6, 3)>  <5, (6, 7, 3)>  <5, (6, 11, 3)>  <5, (7, 4, 0)>  <5, (9, 4, 7)>  <5, (9, 4, 0)>  <5, (4, 7, 1)>  <5, (4, 9, 1)>  <5, (3, 1, 7)>  <5, (3, 6, 2)>

For Node 6, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [36]. 
<6, (7, 3, 11)>  <6, (7, 4, 9)>  <6, (3, 7, 1)>  <6, (3, 11, 13)>

For Node 7, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars = [46]. 
<7, (2, 3, 13)>  <7, (2, 6, 11)>  <7, (1, 3, 6)>  <7, (1, 3, 2)>  <7, (1, 13, 11)>  <7, (1, 13, 10)>  <7, (13, 11, 10)>  <7, (13, 3, 11)>  <7, (13, 3, 10)>  <7, (11, 3, 10)>

For Node 8, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [50]. 
<8, (0, 14, 12)>

For Node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [54]. 
<9, (4, 7, 0)>  <9, (4, 7, 6)>  <9, (4, 0, 8)>  <9, (7, 4, 1)>

For Node 13, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = [58]. 
<13, (2, 6, 11)>  <13, (2, 11, 12)>  <13, (2, 11, 10)>  <13, (6, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
