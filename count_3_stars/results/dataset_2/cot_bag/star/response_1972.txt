Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For Node 0 having only 4 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 60.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:

\[ <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 13)>, <1, (0, 8, 13)>, <1, (6, 8, 14)>, <1, (6, 13, 14)>, <1, (8, 13, 14)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 14)>, <1, (0, 13, 14)>, <13, (0, 6, 14)> \]
