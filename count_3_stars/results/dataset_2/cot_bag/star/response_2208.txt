Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 7
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 73 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [73].

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 0)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
