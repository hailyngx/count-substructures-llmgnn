Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with the degrees are as follows: 

Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 6 
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 7
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

For node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
For node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For node 6: [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars
For node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 87 3-stars in the graph.

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 11>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 13>, <2, 13, 10>, <2, 13, 5>, <3, 5, 13>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 10, 12>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 14>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 12, 11>, <6, 12, 7>, <6, 14, 2>, <10, 13, 2>, <11, 0, 5>, <11, 2, 4>, <12, 11, 8>, <13, 3, 7>
