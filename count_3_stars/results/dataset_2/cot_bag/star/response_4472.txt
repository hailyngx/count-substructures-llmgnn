Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 20) (13, 24) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 14) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 19) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 16) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 23) (9, 22) (9, 7) (9, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 27) (17, 9) (17, 18) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 21) (8, 27) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 25) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 11) (27, 21) (27, 5) (27, 8) (27, 29) (29, 27) (29, 16) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (25, 22) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 26) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 12) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25) 

Response:
This graph consists of the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 14, 19, 23
- Node 1: 4, 5, 25, 28
- Node 2: 6, 7, 10
- Node 3: 15, 20
- Node 4: 1, 11, 25, 28
- Node 5: 1, 22, 27
- Node 6: 2, 10, 26
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 27
- Node 9: 7, 17, 22
- Node 10: 2, 6, 16, 18
- Node 11: 4, 24, 25
- Node 12: 18, 23
- Node 13: 20, 24
- Node 14: 0, 16, 21
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 10, 14, 26, 29
- Node 17: 9, 18
- Node 18: 10, 12, 17
- Node 19: 0, 24, 26
- Node 20: 13, 21, 3
- Node 21: 14, 20, 27, 28
- Node 22: 5, 9, 25
- Node 23: 0, 12, 25, 28
- Node 24: 11, 13, 19
- Node 25: 1, 4, 11, 23, 25
- Node 26: 6, 16, 19
- Node 27: 5, 21, 8, 29
- Node 28: 1, 4, 21, 23, 27
- Node 29: 16, 27

From the nodes listed above, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes based on the rule mentioned in the initial description. The total number of 3-stars formed around all these nodes will give us the answer.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.
