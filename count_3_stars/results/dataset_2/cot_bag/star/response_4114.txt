Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming only 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, forming only 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 76

So, there are 76 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
