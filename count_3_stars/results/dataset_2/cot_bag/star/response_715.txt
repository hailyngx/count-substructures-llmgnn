Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 13, 14
- Node 2: 4, 9, 10, 11
- Node 3: 7, 9, 10, 13
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 10, 11
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 11
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 13, 14
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8, 12
- Node 8: 6, 7, 14
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 11
- Node 10: 2, 3, 4, 12, 14
- Node 11: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 12: 7, 10, 13
- Node 13: 1, 3, 6, 12
- Node 14: 1, 6, 8, 10

Now, let's list the number of 3-stars with each central node that has three or more neighbors:

- Central node 4: [‎‎‎‎‎‎4 3-stars] <4, (2, 5, 7)> <4, (5, 7, 11)> <4, (2, 7, 10)> <4, (10, 11, 5)>
- Central node 6: [‎‎‎‎‎5 3-stars] <6, (1, 13, 14)> <6, (0, 8, 13)> <6, (8, 14, 1)> <6, (0, 13, 1)> <6, (8, 14, 1)>
- Central node 7: [‎‎‎‎‎‎5 3-stars] <7, (3, 5, 4)> <7, (5, 8, 4)> <7, (8, 12, 4)> <7, (3, 4, 10)> <7, (10, 12, 4)>
- Central node 10: [‎‎‎‎‎4 3-stars] <10, (2, 4, 12)> <10, (3, 4, 10)> <10, (2, 14, 4)> <10, (3, 12, 4)>
- Central node 13: [‎‎‎‎‎2 3-stars] <13, (1, 6, 12)> <13, (1, 3, 12)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [‎‎‎‎‎20].
