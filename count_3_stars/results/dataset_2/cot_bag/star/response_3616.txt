Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 4) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 17) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 8) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 5) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 4) (10, 13) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

So, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 13)>, <1, (11, 15, 19)>, <2, (6, 12, 15)>, <6, (2, 3, 14)>, <7, (0, 9, 13)>, <9, (0, 7, 18)>, <12, (2, 6, 17)>, <13, (0, 7, 17)>, <15, (1, 2, 5)>, <17, (12, 13, 18)>
