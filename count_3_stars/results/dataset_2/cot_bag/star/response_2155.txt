Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 4 neighbors each: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
