Response:
Given the description of the graph, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors for constructing the 3-stars.

1. Node 9 has neighbors {22, 15, 21}.
2. Node 26 has neighbors {28, 7}.
3. Node 14 has neighbors {17, 6, 20, 2}.
4. Node 17 has neighbors {14, 0, 12, 11}.
5. Node 2 has neighbors {14, 29, 18}.
6. Node 29 has neighbors {2, 20}.
7. Node 10 has neighbors {11, 15, 5}.
8. Node 11 has neighbors {17, 10, 13, 6, 15}.
9. Node 22 has neighbors {9, 23, 27, 25}.
10. Node 23 has neighbors {22, 4}.
11. Node 1 has neighbors {3, 20, 24}.
12. Node 3 has neighbors {1, 18}.
13. Node 0 has neighbors {17, 20, 7}.
14. Node 20 has neighbors {14, 29, 1, 0}.
15. Node 18 has neighbors {2, 3, 4}.
16. Node 4 has neighbors {23, 18, 21, 8}.
17. Node 7 has neighbors {26, 0, 16}.
18. Node 21 has neighbors {9, 4}.
19. Node 28 has neighbors {26, 8, 15}.
20. Node 5 has neighbors {10, 24}.
21. Node 13 has neighbors {11, 27}.
22. Node 15 has neighbors {9, 10, 11, 28}.
23. Node 16 has neighbors {7, 12, 25}.
24. Node 12 has neighbors {17, 16, 24, 8}.
25. Node 8 has neighbors {4, 28, 12, 27}.
26. Node 6 has neighbors {14, 11}.
27. Node 25 has neighbors {22, 16, 19}.
28. Node 24 has neighbors {1, 5, 12}.
29. Node 19 has neighbors {25}.

Therefore, the 3-stars can be formed with the following nodes:
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is 18. So, the result is [18].
The unique 3-stars found are:

\<26, (28, 7, 8)>
\<14, (17, 6, 20)>
\<17, (0, 11, 12)>

\<22, (23, 25, 27)>
\<4, (8, 18, 21)>
\<7, (0, 16, 26)>
\<20, (1, 29, 14)>
\<18, (3, 2, 4)>
\<28, (15, 26, 8)>
\<24, (5, 12, 1)>
\<12, (16, 8, 24)>
