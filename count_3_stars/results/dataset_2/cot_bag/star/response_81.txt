Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 80.

Therefore, the final answer is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <5, (9, 3, 12)>
- <6, (7, 11, 8)>
- <8, (4, 1, 14)>
- <0, (8, 14, 11)>
- <14, (5, 6, 8)>
