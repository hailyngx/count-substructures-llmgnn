Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 28 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 18, 7)>
<1, (3, 14, 13)>
<2, (6, 10, 16)>
<3, (1, 12, 19)>
<5, (8, 14, 16)>
<9, (11, 15, 18)>
<10, (2, 7, 16)>
<11, (9, 13, 19)>
<12, (1, 13, 14)>
<13, (1, 11, 15)>
<14, (1, 12, 5)>
<15, (9, 13, 19)>
<16, (5, 2, 14)>
<18, (9, 11, 15)>
