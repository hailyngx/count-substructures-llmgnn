Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 0, 2, 8, and 5. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed from each of these nodes.

- For node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>
  
- For node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <7, (4, 6, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 6)>, <7, (5, 0, 6)>
   
- For node 6: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   - 3-stars: <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 0)>, <6, (4, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 1, 9)>, <6, (7, 1, 0)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <6, (1, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>, <6, (1, 9, 0)>
  
- For node 9: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
   - 3-stars: <9, (4, 1, 3)>, <9, (4, 6, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (8, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (6, 0, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 6)>

- For node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 0)>, <1, (2, 9, 8)>

- For node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>, <3, (1, 9, 0)>

- For node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 9, 5)>, <0, (6, 8, 5)>, <0, (9, 8, 5)>

- For node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - 3-stars: <2, (4, 1, 8)>

- For node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   - 3-stars: <8, (9, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 0, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (9, 2, 5)>

- For node 5: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   - 3-stars: <5, (7, 0, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is given by the sum of the individual calculations for each node: $4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 56$.  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].
