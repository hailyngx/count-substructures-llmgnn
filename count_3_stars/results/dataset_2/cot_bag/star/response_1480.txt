Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 16) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 14) (18, 17) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 9) (0, 19) (0, 13) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (6, 19) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which means we need to check those nodes for potential 3-stars.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (7, 13, 16). Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 4: <4, (7, 13, 16)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (4, 3, 9). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 7: <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 3)>, <7, (3, 9, 4)>, and <7, (3, 4, 9)>.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (17, 18, 12, 15). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 14: <14, (17, 18, 12)>, <14, (17, 18, 15)>, <14, (17, 12, 15)>, and <14, (18, 12, 15)>.

For node 17:
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (14, 10, 5, 18). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 17: <17, (14, 10, 5)>, <17, (14, 10, 18)>, <17, (14, 5, 18)>, and <17, (10, 5, 18)>.

For node 10:
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (17, 15, 8, 9). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 10: <10, (17, 15, 8)>, <10, (17, 15, 9)>, <10, (17, 8, 9)>, and <10, (15, 8, 9)>.

For node 15:
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (14, 10, 8, 11). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 15: <15, (14, 10, 8)>, <15, (14, 10, 11)>, <15, (14, 8, 11)>, and <15, (10, 8, 11)>.

For node 19:
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (11, 6, 0, 9). Hence, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 19: <19, (11, 6, 0)>, <19, (11, 6, 9)>, <19, (11, 0, 9)>, and <19, (6, 0, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 25.
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 13, 16)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <14, (17, 18, 12)>, <14, (17, 18, 15)>, <14, (17, 12, 15)>, <14, (18, 12, 15)>, <17, (14, 10, 5)>, <17, (14, 10, 18)>, <17, (14, 5, 18)>, <17, (10, 5, 18)>, <10, (17, 15, 8)>, <10, (17, 15, 9)>, <10, (17, 8, 9)>, <10, (15, 8, 9)>, <15, (14, 10, 8)>, <15, (14, 10, 11)>, <15, (14, 8, 11)>, <15, (10, 8, 11)>, <19, (11, 6, 0)>, <19, (11, 6, 9)>, <19, (11, 0, 9)>, <19, (6, 0, 9)>.
