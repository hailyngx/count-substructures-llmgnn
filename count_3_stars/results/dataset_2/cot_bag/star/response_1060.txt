Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 13) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 9) (5, 17) (5, 14) (19, 18) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 13) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors (8, 12, 16), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
   
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 7, 14, 16), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 18), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 11, 17), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 12, 18), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 10, 11), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 10, 17), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

8. Node 16 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 15, 17), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors (6, 10, 16, 19), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

10. Node 18 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 13, 19), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:  
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 31 \]

So, there are a total of 31 3-stars in this graph. Enclosing this final number in brackets gives us:  
\[ [31] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
\[
\begin{align*}
&<0, (8, 12, 16)>, \\
&<3, (2, 14, 16)>, \\
&<4, (6, 8, 18)>, \\
&<6, (4, 11, 17)>, \\
&<7, (3, 12, 18)>, \\
&<9, (1, 10, 11)>, \\
&<11, (6, 9, 17)>, \\
&<16, (0, 3, 17)>, \\
&<17, (6, 10, 19)>, \\
&<18, (1, 4, 13)>
\end{align*}
