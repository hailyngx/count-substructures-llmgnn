Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 57 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [57].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9, 11)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 12, 14)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (4, 10, 12)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<9, (0, 7, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 5)>
<11, (0, 13, 2)>
<12, (4, 6, 10)>
<14, (2, 3, 5)>
