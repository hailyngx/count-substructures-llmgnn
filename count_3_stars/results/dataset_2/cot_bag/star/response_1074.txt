Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 2) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 3) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 5) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 23) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 15) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 23) (27, 24) (27, 25) (27, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 3) (10, 16) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 10) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 14) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 14) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 14) (8, 29) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 6) (17, 0) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 1) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 24) (19, 1) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 13, 14, 20, 22, 24, 26. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated gives a total of 40. Therefore, the final result is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
