Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for that particular node, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors that node has. If \( n \geq 3 \), we can form 3-stars. 

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 0: has 6 neighbors, so \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 1: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \) <3-star examples are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, and many more>.
