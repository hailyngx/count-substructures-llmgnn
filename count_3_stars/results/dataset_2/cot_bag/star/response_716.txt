Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 5) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 16) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 3) (13, 1) (16, 10) (16, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 12, 2, 10, 19, 1, 6, 17, 11, 5, 14, 9, 16, 0, and 3.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 45 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 17)>, <7, (4, 19, 10)>, <12, (7, 2, 3)>, <2, (4, 12, 8)>, <10, (7, 15, 19)>, <19, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (8, 6, 13)>, <6, (1, 14, 3)>, <17, (4, 9, 5)>, <11, (2, 6, 0)>, <5, (17, 0, 3)>, <14, (19, 6, 16)>, <9, (4, 7, 17)>, <16, (10, 14, 19)>, <3, (12, 6, 5)>, <4, (7, 2, 9)>, <7, (4, 10, 19)>, <7, (4, 9, 10)>, <7, (10, 19, 15)>, <12, (7, 2, 12)>, <12, (2, 12, 3)>, <12, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (4, 12, 2)>, <2, (12, 2, 8)>, <2, (12, 2, 11)>, <10, (7, 19, 10)>, <10, (7, 10, 16)>, <10, (7, 10, 15)>, <10, (15, 19, 10)>, <19, (7, 10, 19)>, <19, (7, 19, 14)>, <19, (10, 19, 15)>, <19, (14, 19, 6)>, <1, (8, 1, 6)>, <1, (8, 1, 13)>, <6, (1, 6, 14)>, <6, (1, 6, 3)>, <6, (1, 6, 11)>, <17, (4, 17, 9)>, <17, (4, 17, 5)>, <17, (9, 17, 5)>, <17, (5, 17, 3)>, <11, (2, 6, 11)>, <11, (6, 11, 0)>, <11, (2, 11, 6)>, <5, (17, 5, 3)>, <14, (19, 14, 6)>, <14, (6, 14, 16)>, <14, (6, 14, 19)>, <9, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (4, 9, 17)>, <9, (4, 9, 3)>, <9, (7, 9, 17)>, <16, (10, 16, 14)>, <16, (14, 16, 19)>, <3, (12, 3, 6)>, <3, (6, 3, 5)>, <3, (6, 3, 11)>, <3, (17, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].
