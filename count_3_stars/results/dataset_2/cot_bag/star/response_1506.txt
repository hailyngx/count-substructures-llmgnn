Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's note down the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
  
  - Node 0: degree 4
  - Node 1: degree 3
  - Node 2: degree 4
  - Node 3: degree 2
  - Node 4: degree 4
  - Node 5: degree 2
  - Node 6: degree 2
  - Node 7: degree 3
  - Node 8: degree 3
  - Node 9: degree 4
  - Node 10: degree 2
  - Node 11: degree 2
  - Node 12: degree 3
  - Node 13: degree 2
  - Node 14: degree 4
  - Node 15: degree 3
  - Node 16: degree 2
  - Node 17: degree 3
  - Node 18: degree 3
  - Node 19: degree 3

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of 3 or more:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 10)>
<1, (4, 10, 15)>
<2, (0, 8, 12)>
<2, (9, 12, 15)>
<2, (12, 18, 9)>
<4, (10, 14, 17)>
<7, (0, 11, 19)>
<9, (2, 15, 18)>
<9, (3, 10, 15)>
<9, (10, 15, 2)>
<14, (17, 4, 18)>
<14, (18, 4, 17)>
<14, (17, 18, 4)>
<15, (1, 9, 10)>
<17, (14, 19, 4)>
<18, (12, 14, 2)>
<18, (14, 17, 4)>
<19, (0, 7, 11)>
