Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 18) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (15, 5) (15, 13) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 14) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 14, 10, 4
- Node 2: 16, 3, 14
- Node 3: 2, 8, 14, 9
- Node 4: 11, 0, 12
- Node 5: 19, 18, 17, 15
- Node 6: 17, 19
- Node 7: 19, 17, 9
- Node 8: 17, 3
- Node 9: 11, 16, 3, 7, 13
- Node 10: 0, 13
- Node 11: 16, 9, 4
- Node 12: 4, 13
- Node 13: 16, 12, 10, 15, 9
- Node 14: 2, 0, 3, 18
- Node 15: 5, 13
- Node 16: 11, 13, 2
- Node 17: 5, 6, 8, 7
- Node 18: 5, 14
- Node 19: 5, 6, 7

To calculate the total number of 3-stars, we'll examine nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 25 \). So, there are 25 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (15, 13, 19)>, <5, (15, 13, 9)>, <5, (15, 13, 16)>, <5, (15, 13, 10)>, <5, (15, 13, 12)>, <7, (9, 17, 19)>, <9, (11, 13, 16)>, <9, (11, 13, 10)>, <9, (11, 13, 15)>, <9, (11, 13, 7)>, <13, (16, 12, 4)>, <13, (16, 12, 15)>, <13, (16, 12, 10)>, <13, (16, 12, 7)>, <13, (16, 12, 3)>, <13, (16, 10, 7)>, <13, (16, 10, 3)>, <13, (16, 15, 10)>, <13, (16, 15, 7)>, <13, (16, 10, 5)>, <13, (12, 15, 10)>, <13, (12, 15, 7)>, <13, (12, 10, 7)>, <13, (15, 10, 7)>, <13, (15, 10, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [25].
