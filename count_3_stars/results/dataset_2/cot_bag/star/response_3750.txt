Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46 \)

So, there are 46 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [46]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 7, 13>
<2, 6, 12>
<3, 12, 13>
<6, 11, 14>
<7, 13, 14>
<8, 10, 16>
<9, 10, 16>
<12, 13, 19>
<15, 11, 19>
<16, 9, 6>
