Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 8) (16, 5) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (14, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (4, 15) (13, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17, and 18 each have 4 neighbors, while nodes 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 19 each have 2 neighbors, and node 4 has only 1 neighbor. Nodes 16 and 13 are not connected to any other nodes.

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Therefore, nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17, and 18 each contribute \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of 36.

So, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 18, 19)>
<1, (12, 14, 17)>
<3, (0, 14, 18)>
<7, (2, 12, 19)>
<8, (6, 17, 18)>
<12, (1, 7, 14)>
<14, (3, 12, 19)>
<17, (1, 8, 19)>
<18, (0, 8, 19)>
