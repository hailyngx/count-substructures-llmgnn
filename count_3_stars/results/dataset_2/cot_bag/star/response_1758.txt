Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 8, 7}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {5, 8, 6}
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors: {9, 1, 0, 6, 8, 4, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 2, 7}
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {5, 1, 8, 0, 6}
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: {1, 3, 2, 0, 7, 8}
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {4, 3}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {3, 8, 7, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with at least 3 neighbors.

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars: 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 77

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [77].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 0, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
