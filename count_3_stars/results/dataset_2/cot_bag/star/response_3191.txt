Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 14) (6, 10) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 10) (16, 17) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions from each node, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 49 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 18)>, <1, (4, 5, 13)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 19)>, <1, (5, 12, 3)>, <1, (18, 0, 10)>, <3, (8, 14, 3)>, <4, (1, 5, 13)>, <4, (7, 9, 19)>, <4, (13, 11, 15)>, <8, (2, 15, 13)>, <10, (6, 17, 16)>, <13, (5, 12, 3)>, <15, (2, 11, 13)>, <17, (6, 16, 19)>, <18, (8, 0, 10)>.
