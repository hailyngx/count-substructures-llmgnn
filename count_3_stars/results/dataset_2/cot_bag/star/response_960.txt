Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: [1 3-star]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get: 9 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 13>
<3, 4, 13>
<4, 6, 13>
<5, 6, 10>
<5, 7, 11>
<5, 9, 10>
<10, 1, 6>
<10, 13, 14>
<12, 3, 4>

Thus, the final result is [9].
