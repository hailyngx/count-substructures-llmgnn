Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are two nodes with only 1 neighbor, so they cannot form any 3-star. The nodes with 2 neighbors are 6, 0, and 14, they too cannot form any 3-star. Let's focus on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, Node 9 has 4 neighbors, Node 1 has 5 neighbors, Node 3 has 4 neighbors, Node 10 has 5 neighbors, Node 11 has 4 neighbors, Node 8 has 4 neighbors, Node 13 has 5 neighbors, Node 7 has 5 neighbors, Node 12 has 4 neighbors, and Node 2 has 5 neighbors. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by the eligible nodes:
\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 70
\]

Hence, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 3>, (5, 2, 13), <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 14>, <9, 10, 11>, <9, 10, 13>, <9, 10, 4>, <9, 8, 1>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 11>, <1, 7, 13>, <3, 4, 10>, <10, 11, 13>, <10, 6, 2>, <11, 7, 13>, <8, 9, 1>, <13, 11, 12>, <13, 11, 7>, <13, 7, 12>, <7, 11, 13>, <7, 11, 8>, <12, 7, 14>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 5, 13>
