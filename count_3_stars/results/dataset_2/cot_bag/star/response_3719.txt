Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors {7, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 7, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 1, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 1, 0, 6, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {7, 6, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 9, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 0, 3, 5, 1, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 7, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- For Node 0: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- For Node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- For Node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- For Node 4: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- For Node 5: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- For Node 7: 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 58

Therefore, there are [58] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>.
