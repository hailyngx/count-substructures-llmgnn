Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 5) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 11) (3, 2) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 19) (1, 10) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 0) (16, 14) (16, 12) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 14, 13, 8, 10, 5, 6, 18, 4, 2, 11, 1, 15, 0, 9, 12, 16, 7, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
12. Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
13. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
15. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
16. Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
17. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 31 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (13, 6, 5)>, <6, (0, 6, 11)>, <7, (19, 7, 2)>, <8, (13, 14, 8)>, <9, (0, 9, 19)>, <10, (1, 10, 4)>, <11, (19, 4, 11)>, <12, (0, 12, 16)>, <13, (15, 13, 7)>, <14, (19, 14, 16)>, <18, (2, 4, 18)>, <19, (19, 11, 7)>
