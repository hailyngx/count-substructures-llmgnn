Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 9) (1, 26) (1, 29) (26, 1) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 8) (0, 23) (2, 0) (2, 19) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 16) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 27) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 25) (11, 14) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 29) (23, 0) (23, 11) (23, 19) (3, 28) (3, 5) (12, 29) (16, 21) (16, 6) (16, 24) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 12) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 9) (7, 28) (7, 20) (20, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 4) (9, 27) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 23) (19, 4) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 8) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 27) (8, 0) (8, 25) (27, 28) (27, 5) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: 14, 17, 28, and 13.

Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <14, (17, 11, 19)>, <14, (17, 15, 19)>, <14, (11, 15, 19)>, and <14, (17, 11, 15)>.

Node 17 also has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <17, (14, 24, 9)>, <17, (14, 24, 9)>, <17, (14, 24, 9)>, and <17, (14, 24, 9)>.

Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <28, (21, 3, 7)>, <28, (21, 3, 27)>, <28, (21, 7, 27)>, <28, (21, 3, 18)>, <28, (21, 7, 18)>, <28, (21, 27, 18)>, <28, (3, 7, 18)>, <28, (3, 27, 18)>, <28, (7, 27, 18)>, and <28, (21, 3, 18)>.

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <13, (5, 18, 10)>, <13, (5, 18, 27)>, <13, (18, 10, 27)>, and <13, (5, 10, 27)>.

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 3-stars in this graph. So the final count is [22].
