Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 9, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0  
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 5, 4, 7, 8, 0, 1  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7  
Node 7 has 7 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, 1, 8  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 3, 1, 2  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 7  

Now, for the number of 3-stars:  
Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars  
Node 3 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars  
Node 7 forms inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars  
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars  

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 35 + 10 = 85

Therefore, there are 85 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<1, (4, 7, 0)>  
<1, (4, 8, 0)>  
<1, (7, 8, 0)>  
<3, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (4, 7, 0)>  
<3, (4, 8, 0)>  
<3, (7, 8, 0)>  
<7, (5, 9, 4)>  
<7, (5, 9, 0)>  
<7, (5, 4, 0)>  
<7, (5, 0, 1)>  
<7, (9, 4, 0)>  
<7, (9, 4, 1)>  
<7, (9, 0, 1)>  
<7, (4, 0, 1)>  
<8, (6, 4, 3)>  
<8, (6, 4, 1)>  
<8, (6, 3, 1)>  
<8, (4, 3, 1)>
