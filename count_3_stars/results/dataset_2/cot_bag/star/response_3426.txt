Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 1
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 45 3-stars. So, the final answer is [45].
The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
