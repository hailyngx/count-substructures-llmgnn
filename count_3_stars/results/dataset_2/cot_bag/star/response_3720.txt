Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by considering each node:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 29, 6. 
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 23, 2. 
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 21, 9. 
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 26, 16. 
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, 18. 
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 28, 5. 
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 24, 8. 
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 16, 0. 
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 17, 14. 
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 13, 5. 
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 1, 6. 
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 11, 27. 
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 1, 13. 
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 10, 19. 

Adding them up:
14 3-stars are formed in this graph, and they are:
<2, (17, 29, 6)>, <6, (15, 23, 2)>, <7, (15, 21, 9)>, <8, (29, 26, 16)>, <9, (3, 7, 18)>, <10, (17, 28, 5)>, <11, (0, 24, 8)>, <14, (26, 16, 0)>, <16, (18, 17, 14)>, <19, (28, 13, 5)>, <23, (2, 1, 6)>, <24, (28, 11, 27)>, <26, (21, 1, 13)>, <28, (29, 10, 19)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
