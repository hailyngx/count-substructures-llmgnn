Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 14) (22, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 17) (6, 20) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (1, 5) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 7) (12, 4) (29, 17) (29, 11) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 25) (16, 25) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 13) (28, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 27) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 24) (23, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (15, 26) (15, 8) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 18) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 16) (25, 18) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) (24, 10) (24, 23) (11, 5) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
With the given information, let's analyze the degrees of each node based on the edges provided:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 2
 
Nodes 14 and 17 are the only nodes with degree 5, meaning they are the centers of 3-star subgraphs. Let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs formed around nodes 14 and 17:

For node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 (from node 14) + 10 (from node 17)] = 20.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<14, (22, 17, 23)>
<14, (17, 29, 19)>
<14, (17, 19, 25)>
<14, (22, 3, 5)>
<14, (23, 0, 26)>
<17, (13, 6, 14)>
<17, (13, 29, 11)>
<17, (6, 14, 23)>
<17, (6, 14, 25)>
<17, (19, 25, 18)> 

So, the final answer is [20].
