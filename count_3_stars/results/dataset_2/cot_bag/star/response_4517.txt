Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 8, 13, 2, 0, 14, and 7.  

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 14)>, <5, (9, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 8, 14)>  

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (13, 2, 10)>, <8, (13, 2, 3)>, <8, (13, 10, 3)>, <8, (13, 10, 6)>, <8, (13, 3, 6)>, 
<8, (2, 10, 3)>, <8, (2, 10, 13)>, <8, (2, 3, 13)>, <8, (10, 3, 13)>, <8, (10, 3, 6)>  

For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<13, (8, 3, 0)>, <13, (8, 3, 6)>, <13, (8, 0, 6)>, <13, (8, 0, 4)>, <13, (8, 6, 4)>, 
<13, (3, 0, 6)>, <13, (3, 0, 12)>, <13, (3, 6, 12)>, <13, (0, 6, 4)>, <13, (0, 6, 12)>  

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>  

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<0, (13, 14, 11)>  

For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<14, (5, 0, 1)>, <14, (5, 0, 7)>, <14, (5, 0, 4)>, <14, (5, 1, 7)>, <14, (5, 1, 4)>,
<14, (5, 7, 4)>, <14, (0, 1, 7)>, <14, (0, 1, 4)>, <14, (0, 7, 4)>, <14, (1, 7, 4)>  

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (6, 14, 12)>, <7, (6, 14, 11)>, <7, (6, 12, 11)>, <7, (14, 12, 11)>  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43\)  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [43].
