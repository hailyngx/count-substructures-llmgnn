Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have at least three neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 8, 13, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 7, 13, 12. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors: 8, 10, 3. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 8, 14, 6, 10. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 9, 0, 11, 6, 13. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 7, 3, 12, 4. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors: 8, 6, 13, 1. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 0, 12, 3, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 10, 1. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 2, 14, 3, 12, 13. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has neighbors: 8, 1, 6, 10. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has neighbors: 0, 7, 1, 4, 10. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 3, 10. It forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes that have at least three neighbors, we get a total of 13 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 13. 

So, the answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 13)>
<2, (8, 10, 3)>
<3, (2, 8, 14)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (8, 6, 13)>
<8, (2, 0, 12)>
<9, (4, 10, 1)>
<10, (9, 2, 14)>
<12, (8, 1, 6)>
<13, (0, 7, 1)>
<14, (5, 3, 10)>
