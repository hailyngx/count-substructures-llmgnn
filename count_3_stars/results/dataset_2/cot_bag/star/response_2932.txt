Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 85 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 6, 9, 13>
<4, 3, 5, 7>
<5, 3, 4, 12>
<6, 1, 10, 13>
<8, 2, 14, 11>
<9, 4, 10, 13>
<10, 0, 6, 9>
<11, 7, 8, 14>
<12, 0, 2, 4>
<13, 6, 9, 10>
<14, 1, 2, 8>
