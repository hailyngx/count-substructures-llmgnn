Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (6, 12, 4), so there is exactly 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 12, 4)>.

2. Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (9, 13, 14, 0), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (9, 13, 14)>, <8, (9, 13, 0)>, <8, (9, 14, 0)>, <8, (13, 14, 0)>.

3. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (8, 11, 7, 12), so there are 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 11, 7)>, <9, (8, 11, 12)>, <9, (8, 7, 12)>, <9, (11, 7, 12)>.

4. Node 10: It has 6 neighbors (11, 0, 3, 6, 4, 14), so there are 20 3-stars with node 10 as the center. We can list a few: <10, (11, 0, 3)>, <10, (11, 0, 6)>, <10, (11, 0, 4)>, <10, (11, 0, 14)>, <10, (11, 3, 6)>.

5. Node 12: It has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 7, 3, 1), so there are 10 3-stars with node 12 as the center. We can list a few: <12, (5, 9, 7)>, <12, (5, 9, 3)>, <12, (5, 9, 1)>, <12, (5, 7, 3)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [39].
