Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 0) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (18, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 16) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4: There are 5 neighbors of node 4 (9, 10, 14, 3, 11), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.
2. Node 6: There are 4 neighbors of node 6 (9, 10, 14, 6), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.
3. Node 7: There are 5 neighbors of node 7 (8, 11, 16, 5, 18), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node.
4. Node 9: There are 3 neighbors of node 9 (13, 4, 6), so we have only 1 3-star with node 9 as the central node.
5. Node 10: There are 3 neighbors of node 10 (4, 6, 15), so we have only 1 3-star with node 10 as the central node.
6. Node 11: There are 4 neighbors of node 11 (16, 4, 7, 2), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the central node.
7. Node 14: There are 4 neighbors of node 14 (17, 4, 12, 6), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the central node.
8. Node 15: There are 4 neighbors of node 15 (12, 10, 19, 5), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the central node.
9. Node 16: There are 4 neighbors of node 16 (3, 5, 7, 11), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the central node.
10. Node 17: There are 3 neighbors of node 17 (1, 12, 14), so we have only 1 3-star with node 17 as the central node.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each central node gives a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33 \) 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <7, (8, 5, 18)>, <11, (16, 7, 2)>, <14, (17, 4, 12)>, <15, (12, 19, 5)>, <16, (3, 5, 7)>.
