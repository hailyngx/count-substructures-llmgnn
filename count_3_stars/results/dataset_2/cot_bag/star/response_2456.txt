Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 73 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [73], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 8, 14)>, <2, (0, 1, 14)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 12, 14)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 12)>, <11, (7, 12, 13)>, <12, (6, 7, 9)>, <14, (0, 4, 13)>.
