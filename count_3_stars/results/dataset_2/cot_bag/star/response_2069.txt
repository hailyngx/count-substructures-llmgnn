Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
11. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 60.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 13)>, 
<1, (6, 10, 14)>, 
<2, (1, 7, 14)>, 
<3, (7, 13, 14)>, 
<4, (10, 11, 13)>, 
<6, (1, 12, 13)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 13)>, 
<8, (9, 12, 14)>, 
<10, (1, 13, 4)>, 
<13, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<14, (2, 3, 8)>.
