Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 6) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (11, 12) (11, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. 

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (16, 19, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (10, 11, 17)>
<12, (1, 11, 18)>
<13, (2, 7, 4)>
<15, (10, 18, 12)>
<16, (0, 6, 14)>
<17, (3, 8, 18)>
<18, (3, 15, 9)>
<19, (0, 9, 14)>
