Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 

Node 2: (2, 16), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 15)
Node 5: (5, 12), (5, 11), (5, 16), (5, 7)
Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 1)
Node 7: (7, 18), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 15)
Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 12), (10, 14)
Node 12: (12, 5), (12, 17), (12, 3), (12, 10), (12, 11)
Node 15: (15, 2), (15, 18), (15, 7), (15, 8), (15, 14)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (10, 14, 12)>, <5, (12, 11, 7)>, <7, (15, 2, 5)>, <12, (10, 5, 11)>, <15, (8, 14, 7)>
