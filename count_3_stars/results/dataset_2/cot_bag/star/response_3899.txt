Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 5
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 5

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
