Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 4}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 6, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7, 0}

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and find the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 3:
- In this case, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

For Node 6:
- In this case, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 = 30. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>.
