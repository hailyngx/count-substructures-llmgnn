Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 7) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 26) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 25) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 4) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 7) (28, 21) (28, 3) (29, 3) (29, 12) (2, 19) (8, 10) (8, 26) (21, 28) (21, 12) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 8) (26, 23) (22, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 7) (4, 16) (4, 6) (23, 6) (23, 26) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 20) (13, 12) (13, 19) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 1) (20, 10) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 25) (12, 29) (12, 21) (12, 13) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 20) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 24) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- 0: {15, 17, 26, 27}
- 1: {7, 11, 20}
- 2: {19}
- 3: {7, 28, 29}
- 4: {6, 16}
- 5: {14, 16, 24, 25}
- 6: {4, 9, 20, 23}
- 7: {1, 3, 9, 27}
- 8: {10, 26}
- 9: {6, 7, 20}
- 10: {8, 20, 27}
- 11: {1, 16, 17, 18}
- 12: {13, 21, 29}
- 13: {12, 19}
- 14: {5, 17, 22, 25}
- 15: {0, 18, 26, 27}
- 16: {4, 5, 11}
- 17: {0, 11, 14, 19}
- 18: {11, 15, 24}
- 19: {2, 13, 17, 25}
- 20: {1, 6, 9, 10, 24}
- 21: {12, 28}
- 22: {14}
- 23: {6, 26}
- 24: {5, 18, 20}
- 25: {5, 14, 19}
- 26: {0, 8, 15, 23}
- 27: {0, 7, 10, 15}
- 28: {3, 21}
- 29: {3, 12}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 18: <11, (16, 17, 18)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 26, and 27: <15, (0, 26, 27)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 11: <16, (4, 5, 11)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, and 19: <17, (11, 14, 19)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 15, and 23: <26, (0, 15, 23)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <20, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, and [6] is the final answer.
