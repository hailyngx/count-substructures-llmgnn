Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 5

Node 1: 0, 6

Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 8

Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7

Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9

Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8

Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8

Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9

Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 9

Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (4, 7, 8)>.
