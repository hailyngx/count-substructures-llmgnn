Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 7

Using the provided formula, we can now calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding them up: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 65. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)> \]

Putting the final number inside brackets:
\[ [65] \]
