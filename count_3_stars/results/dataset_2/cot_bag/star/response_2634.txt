Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 56 \)

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in the given graph. 

In brackets, we write [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 11)>
<2, (15, 17, 18)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (11, 14, 19)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (10, 13, 19)>
<8, (0, 13, 16)>
<10, (5, 7, 9)>
<11, (0, 14, 15)>
<12, (7, 15, 17)>
<13, (7, 16, 19)>
<15, (2, 11, 18)>
<16, (1, 13, 8)>
<17, (1, 2, 6)>
<18, (2, 15, 4)>
<19, (4, 7, 11)>
