Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 8, 6, 2, and 0.

For node 5:
- There are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars with this node: <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 6)>.

For node 9:
- There are \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \) 3-stars with this node: <9, (8, 3, 4)>, <9, (8, 3, 6)>.

For node 8:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node: <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>.

For node 6:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with this node: <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <6, (4, 3, 2)>, <6, (4, 3, 1)>, <6, (4, 3, 0)>, <6, (7, 3, 0)>, <6, (7, 3, 1)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <6, (7, 0, 1)>, <6, (3, 1, 0)>.

For node 2:
- There is 1 3-star with this node: <2, (5, 0, 8)>.

For node 0:
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with this node: <0, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>, <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <0, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (5, 2, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (7, 6, 1)>, <0, (7, 6, 3)>, <0, (7, 1, 3)>, <0, (2, 8, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 1)>, <0, (2, 6, 3)>, <0, (8, 6, 7)>, <0, (8, 6, 4)>, <0, (6, 1, 3)>.

Adding all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [40] different 3-stars in this graph.
