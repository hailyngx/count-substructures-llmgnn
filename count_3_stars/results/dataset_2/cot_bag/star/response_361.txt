Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 55 \]

So, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (0, 12, 13)> 
<11, (0, 4, 8)> 
<11, (2, 3, 8)> 
<11, (2, 4, 11)> 
<11, (3, 4, 11)> 
<10, (2, 8, 12)> 
<10, (2, 13, 14)> 
<10, (8, 12, 13)> 
<10, (8, 12, 14)> 
<10, (12, 13, 14)>
