Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 26) (22, 23) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (6, 13) (6, 20) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 20) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 20) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (4, 0) (4, 27) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 13) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 24) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 29) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 12) (1, 24) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 24) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 2) (9, 12) (25, 18) (25, 4) (15, 17) (15, 23) (16, 27) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 29) (5, 18) (5, 3) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 9) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 2) (24, 20) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are five nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 4, 16, 19, 26, and 28.

For node 4:
There are 5 choices for the 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 4: <4, (0, 27, 16)>.

For node 16:
There are 4 choices for the 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 16: <16, (27, 4, 29)>.

For node 19:
There are 4 choices for the 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 19: <19, (28, 8, 24)>.

For node 26:
There are 5 choices for the 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 26: <26, (17, 23, 28)>.

For node 28:
There are 5 choices for the 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars for node 28: <28, (17, 9, 19)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38 \).

Putting the final answer inside brackets, we have: [38].
