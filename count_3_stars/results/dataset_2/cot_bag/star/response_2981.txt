Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 13, 5, 2, 0, 7, 4, 11, 14, and 10.  
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes.  

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 13 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 0 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 7 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4 as the center.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 11 as the center.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 14 as the center.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 10 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 130 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [130].  

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<6, (9, 5, 10)>  
<6, (9, 8, 14)>  
<6, (9, 13, 2)>  
<6, (9, 13, 0)>  
<6, (9, 13, 7)>  
<6, (5, 2, 11)>  
<6, (5, 2, 10)>  
<6, (5, 2, 7)>  
<6, (2, 8, 0)>  
<6, (2, 8, 7)>  
<6, (8, 0, 13)>  
<6, (8, 2, 13)>  
<9, (1, 3, 11)>  
<9, (1, 3, 10)>  
<9, (3, 1, 11)>  
<9, (3, 1, 10)>  
<9, (8, 1, 14)>  
<9, (13, 4, 2)>  
<9, (13, 4, 0)>  
<9, (13, 4, 7)>  
<9, (4, 3, 14)>  
<1, (3, 14, 4)>  
<3, (14, 4, 10)>  
<8, (1, 0, 13)>  
<13, (0, 12, 7)>  
<5, (2, 7, 11)>  
<2, (13, 0, 12)>  
<0, (8, 2, 13)>  
<7, (13, 5, 11)>  
<4, (13, 10, 6)>  

This is the final answer.
