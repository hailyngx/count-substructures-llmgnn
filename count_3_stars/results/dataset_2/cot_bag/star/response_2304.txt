Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<3, (6, 12, 17)>
<5, (6, 7, 15)>
<6, (3, 5, 18)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 15, 17)>
<10, (0, 11, 16)>
<11, (4, 10, 14)>
<12, (3, 16, 17)>
<13, (1, 4, 12)>
<14, (2, 11, 18)>
<15, (5, 9, 19)>
<16, (7, 10, 12)>
<17, (3, 9, 13)>
<18, (2, 6, 14)>
<19, (6, 8, 15)>
