Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 15) (27, 0) (27, 17) (27, 8) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 16) (10, 21) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 20) (22, 11) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 6) (22, 5) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 29) (12, 26) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 29) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 15) (4, 22) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 17) (13, 17) (13, 28) (17, 27) (17, 25) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 20) (19, 15) (6, 22) (6, 1) (24, 28) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 29) (16, 25) (9, 25) (9, 4) (14, 28) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (29, 15) (5, 22) (5, 7) (5, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are: 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: 1 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: 1 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: 1 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: 1 3-star
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: 1 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 20: 1 3-star
- For node 21: 1 3-star
- For node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 23: 1 3-star
- For node 25: 1 3-star
- For node 26: 1 3-star
- For node 27: 1 3-star
- For node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 29: 1 3-star

Adding these up: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 62\)

Therefore, there are 62 total 3-stars ([]).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 22, 26)>
- <1, (7, 26, 29)>
- <1, (10, 21, 20)>
- <1, (12, 29, 15)>
- <2, (4, 18, 17)>
- <3, (11, 22, 20)>
- <17, (4, 9, 18)>
- <17, (13, 28, 24)>
- <22, (5, 7, 28)>
- <22, (6, 1, 5)>
