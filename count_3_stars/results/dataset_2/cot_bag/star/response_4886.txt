Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (6, 8) (6, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (10, 14) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [42] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (17, 7, 4)>
<4, (1, 19, 16)>
<7, (0, 1, 12)>
<8, (17, 19, 13)>
<12, (7, 0, 13)>
<13, (12, 19, 9)>
<15, (11, 2, 18)>
<17, (1, 5, 14)>
<19, (1, 4, 8)>
