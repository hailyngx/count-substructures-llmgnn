Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 7) (22, 25) (22, 17) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 6) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 20) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 27) (3, 2) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 8) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 15) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 18) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 3) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 19) (20, 17) (20, 24) (12, 4) (5, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 11) (11, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 20) (24, 5) (18, 13) (18, 29) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 26) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 15) (15, 25) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 9, 26, 17, 3, 25, 7, 21, 29, 28, 16, 24, 18, 23, 2, 10, 0, 8, 15, 19, 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 22 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 26 as the center.
- Node 17 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 17 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 25 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 21 as the center.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 29 as the center.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 28 as the center.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16 as the center.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 24 as the center.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 18 as the center.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 23 as the center.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the center.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 80 \)

So, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<13, (16, 17, 22)>, <22, (0, 7, 13)>, <9, (2, 21, 26)>, <26, (6, 9, 28)>, <17, (14, 20, 29)>, <3, (2, 24, 25)>, <25, (15, 22, 29)>, <7, (10, 21, 22)>, <21, (15, 23, 9)>, <29, (17, 18, 25)>, <28, (16, 26, 5)>, <16, (13, 19, 28)>, <24, (20, 29, 3)>, <18, (13, 23, 29)>, <23, (2, 18, 21)>, <2, (10, 21, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 22)>, <8, (0, 15, 16)>, <15, (5, 8, 25)>
