Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 17) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) (29, 6) (10, 21) (10, 15) (11, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 5) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 3) (4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 6) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 11) (8, 5) (28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 25) (24, 19) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 14) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 12) (13, 20) (13, 6) (13, 3) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 61

Thus, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (16, 6, 14)>
- <2, (25, 14, 6)>
- <3, (22, 5, 13)>
- <4, (20, 5, 28)>
- <6, (29, 16, 14)>
- <7, (24, 12, 28)>
- <9, (18, 23, 0)>
- <12, (17, 23, 7)>
- <13, (20, 3, 6)>
- <14, (16, 25, 6)>
- <15, (10, 2, 1)>
- <16, (0, 6, 14)>
- <17, (12, 18, 21)>
- <19, (26, 24, 22)>
- <20, (0, 13, 4)>
- <21, (17, 10, 22)>
- <22, (21, 19, 3)>
- <23, (12, 9, 26)>
- <26, (3, 23, 19)>
- <28, (7, 0, 4)>
