Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [4]
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: [20]
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [4]
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: [20]
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [10]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [4]
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [1]

Summing these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
