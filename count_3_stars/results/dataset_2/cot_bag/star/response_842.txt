Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with the corresponding number of neighbors are:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1] 3-star
- Node 1: [1] 3-star
- Node 2: [C(4,3)] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 3: [C(4,3)] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 4: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 5: [C(4,3)] = [4] 3-stars
- Node 6: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 7: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 8: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 9: [1] 3-star
- Node 10: [1] 3-star
- Node 11: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars
- Node 12: [1] 3-star
- Node 13: [1] 3-star
- Node 14: [C(5,3)] = [10] 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [ 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [66] \]

Therefore, there are 66 total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 14, 3)>
<1, (9, 0, 2)>
<2, (10, 0, 14)>
<3, (4, 8, 14)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (6, 12, 3)>
<6, (11, 8, 14)>
<7, (11, 13, 9)>
<8, (6, 11, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (2, 14, 6)>
<11, (7, 13, 9)>
<12, (5, 6, 3)>
<13, (11, 7, 9)>
<14, (10, 6, 14)>
