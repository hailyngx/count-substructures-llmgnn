Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 6) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 0) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 26) (13, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 14) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 21) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 22) (26, 8) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 17) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (4, 18) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 3) (18, 7) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 25) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 20) (16, 12) (16, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (29, 7) (29, 25) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (11, 27) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 4) (28, 19) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (15, 6, 27), (6, 27, 9), (6, 9, 19)
2. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 12, 16), (7, 12, 29), (7, 12, 18)
3. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 27, 6), (9, 6, 19), (9, 6, 25)
4. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (0, 14, 23)
5. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 7, 12), (18, 7, 20), (18, 7, 25)
6. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: (15, 20, 6), (20, 6, 28), (20, 6, 18)
7. Node 25 has 5 neighbors: (9, 25, 18), (25, 18, 17), (25, 18, 19), (25, 18, 29)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up:  

\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 31 \]

So, there are 31 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
Thus, the answer is [31].
