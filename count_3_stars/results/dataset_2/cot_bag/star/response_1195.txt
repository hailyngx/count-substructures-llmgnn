Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes in the graph. Let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 2 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up gives us a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 74 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 11)>, <0, (3, 10, 12)>, <0, (4, 5, 12)>, <0, (5, 8, 12)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <3, (0, 9, 13)>, <3, (0, 12, 13)>, <4, (1, 5, 12)>, <4, (6, 9, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <5, (4, 8, 13)>, <5, (10, 12, 14)>, <6, (4, 9, 13)>, <6, (9, 8, 13)>, <7, (0, 11, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 13)>, <8, (9, 10, 12)>, <9, (3, 6, 13)>, <10, (1, 5, 14)>, <12, (4, 5, 1)>
