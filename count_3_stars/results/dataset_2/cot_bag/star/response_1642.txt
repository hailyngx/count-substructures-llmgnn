Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 4) (13, 4) (13, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
There are two nodes labeled 3 and 16 that have exactly 3 neighbors, which means they will each form exactly 1 3-star. 

For node 3, the 3-star is <3, (5, 7, 8)>. 
For node 16, the 3-star is <16, (4, 10, 18)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
