Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first analyze which nodes have three or more neighbors and then identify the 3-stars formed by those nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (4, 0), (7, 0), (3, 0), (8, 0)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 0 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 3)>, <0, (4, 3, 8)>, <0, (7, 3, 8)>

2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (5, 2), (9, 2), (4, 2), (7, 2), (1, 2)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 2 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 1)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 1)>

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (9, 4), (0, 4), (6, 4), (2, 4)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (0, 6, 2)>

4. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (9, 5), (2, 5), (8, 5)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 5 = 1
   <5, (9, 2, 8)>

5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6), (8, 6)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <6, (4, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 1, 8)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>

6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (9, 7), (0, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 7 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>

7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (5, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8), (0, 8), (6, 8)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 8 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <8, (5, 1, 3)>, <8, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (5, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (5, 0, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 0, 6)>, <8, (3, 0, 6)>

8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (5, 9), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 9)
   So, the number of 3-stars with Node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 41.
