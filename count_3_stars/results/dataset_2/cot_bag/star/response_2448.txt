Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (0, 4) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 16) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 16) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 2 neighbors  
Node 1: 3 neighbors  
Node 2: 4 neighbors  
Node 3: 5 neighbors  
Node 4: 4 neighbors  
Node 5: 1 neighbor  
Node 6: 3 neighbors  
Node 7: 2 neighbors  
Node 8: 3 neighbors  
Node 9: 4 neighbors  
Node 10: 2 neighbors  
Node 11: 3 neighbors  
Node 12: 4 neighbors  
Node 13: 4 neighbors  
Node 14: 3 neighbors  
Node 15: 3 neighbors  
Node 16: 3 neighbors  
Node 17: 2 neighbors  
Node 18: 4 neighbors  
Node 19: 4 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (11, 19, 15)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (17, 13, 8)>
<4, (18, 7, 0)>
<6, (19, 13, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 1)>
<11, (15, 8, 16)>
<12, (4, 9, 10)>
<13, (6, 18, 19)>
<14, (16, 9, 19)>
<16, (2, 15, 14)>
<19, (14, 16, 9)>
<0, (4, 18, 7)>
<8, (15, 16, 14)>
<15, (11, 8, 16)>
<18, (7, 0, 4)>
<17, (3, 13, 8)>
