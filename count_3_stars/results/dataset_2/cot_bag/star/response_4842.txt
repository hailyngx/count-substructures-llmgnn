Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 10) (18, 4) (18, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 9) (11, 25) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 24) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 21) (16, 6) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 27) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 23) (0, 26) (0, 24) (0, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (12, 3) (27, 28) (27, 24) (27, 1) (20, 3) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 23) (6, 16) (6, 0) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 20) (23, 17) (23, 20) (23, 21) (1, 8) (1, 27) (1, 10) (1, 22) (10, 29) (10, 1) (21, 14) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (22, 1) (22, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <4, (7, 11, 18)>, <4, (2, 11, 25)>, <4, (2, 13, 15)>, <4, (11, 18, 25)>
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <7, (9, 19, 21)>
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <8, (1, 2, 13)>
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <9, (7, 11, 17)>, <9, (11, 17, 20)>, <9, (9, 17, 20)>, <9, (9, 11, 20)>
Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <11, (4, 9, 25)>, <11, (4, 9, 26)>, <11, (4, 11, 26)>, <11, (9, 18, 25)>
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <13, (2, 8, 15)>
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <14, (15, 19, 21)>
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <15, (13, 14, 19)>, <15, (13, 14, 24)>, <15, (14, 19, 21)>, <15, (19, 21, 24)>
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <19, (7, 15, 21)>, <19, (11, 15, 25)>, <19, (15, 21, 23)>, <19, (15, 21, 25)>
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <20, (5, 9, 23)>, <20, (17, 20, 23)>, <20, (20, 23, 5)>, <20, (20, 23, 9)>
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <21, (14, 19, 22)>, <21, (19, 21, 22)>, <21, (19, 21, 23)>, <21, (19, 22, 23)>
Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <23, (17, 20, 21)>
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <24, (0, 15, 27)>
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <25, (11, 18, 19)>, <25, (11, 19, 21)>, <25, (19, 21, 25)>, <25, (18, 19, 25)>
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <26, (11, 28, 0)>
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <27, (1, 24, 28)>
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <28, (26, 29, 27)>
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <29, (5, 10, 14)>, <29, (5, 10, 20)>, <29, (10, 14, 20)>, <29, (5, 14, 20)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 33 3-stars, so the final answer is [33].
