Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 13)>, <2, (4, 11, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 14)>, <2, (12, 10, 3)>, <3, (0, 7, 12)>, <3, (2, 4, 11)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 13, 1)>, <3, (7, 12, 8)>, <4, (2, 11, 4)>, <4, (7, 12, 3)>, <5, (1, 13, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 10)>, <8, (11, 2, 4)>, <8, (12, 3, 7)>.
