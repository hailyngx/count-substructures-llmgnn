Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (6, 22) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 20) (1, 3) (1, 26) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 14) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 21) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 21) (25, 20) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (2, 18) (2, 25) (2, 15) (2, 0) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 10) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 10) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 12) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 2) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 3) (14, 23) (14, 7) (17, 7) (27, 13) (7, 14) (7, 17) (19, 25) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 28) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 25. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47\), so the total number of 3-stars is [47].
