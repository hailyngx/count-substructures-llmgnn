Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the given criteria. Node 13, 22, 3, 17, 5, 6, and 18 have more than three neighbors and can possibly form 3-stars. 

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the eligible nodes:
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 46 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [46].
The unique 3-stars are:
