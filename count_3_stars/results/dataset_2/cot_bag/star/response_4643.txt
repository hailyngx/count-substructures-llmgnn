Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars for each node, we have a total of 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (7, 1, 13)>, <0, (7, 4, 12)>, <0, (6, 4, 7)>, <0, (6, 4, 3)>, <0, (1, 4, 12)>, <1, (0, 7, 13)>, <1, (4, 7, 12)>, <1, (4, 6, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (7, 4, 3)>, <3, (4, 6, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 3)>, <4, (6, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 14)>, <5, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (12, 13, 14)>, <5, (13, 8, 14)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 14)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <10, (6, 12, 13)>, <12, (4, 5, 10)>, <13, (1, 0, 10)>, <14, (5, 6, 8)>.
