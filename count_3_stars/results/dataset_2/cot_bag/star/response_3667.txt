Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 6) (18, 17) (18, 29) (22, 27) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 15) (28, 20) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 12) (15, 28) (16, 20) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 13) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 12) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 7) (25, 8) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 14) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 21) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 14) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 20) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 29) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 12) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 35.
