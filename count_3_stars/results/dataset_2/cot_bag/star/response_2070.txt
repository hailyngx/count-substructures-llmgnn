Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars and calculate their total number.

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: [7, 6, 9]
- Node 1: [4, 5, 14, 9]
- Node 2: [11, 19, 3]
- Node 3: [11, 16, 2]
- Node 4: [8, 1]
- Node 5: [7, 1, 14]
- Node 6: [16, 0, 19, 18]
- Node 7: [10, 0, 5]
- Node 8: [13, 4, 12]
- Node 9: [0, 1, 18, 19]
- Node 10: [13, 17, 7]
- Node 11: [16, 3, 2]
- Node 12: [8, 19]
- Node 13: [8, 17, 10, 15]
- Node 14: [5, 1]
- Node 15: [13, 17]
- Node 16: [11, 3, 6]
- Node 17: [13, 15]
- Node 18: [10, 9, 6]
- Node 19: [2, 6, 12, 9]

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24 \]

So, there are a total of 24 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: \( [24] \)
