Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 2) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 8) (25, 15) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 4) (4, 25) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (20, 25) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (19, 6) (19, 23) (26, 22) (26, 3) (26, 0) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 6) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 24) (8, 3) (8, 1) (11, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 24) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 26) (5, 21) (5, 1) (23, 19) (23, 24) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (16, 25) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 23) (18, 13) (18, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27: has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 28: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 50

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, 15, 14, 27>
<2, 10, 4, 29>
<4, 10, 7, 21>
<6, 14, 9, 24>
<9, 12, 28, 24>
<15, 0, 29, 13>
<20, 25, 16, 18>
<21, 7, 5, 1>
<25, 3, 8, 1>
<26, 22, 17, 20>
