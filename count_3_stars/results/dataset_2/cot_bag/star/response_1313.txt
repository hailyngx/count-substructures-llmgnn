Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2

Now, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
