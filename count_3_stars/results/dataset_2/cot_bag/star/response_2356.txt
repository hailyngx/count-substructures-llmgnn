Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 57 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [57].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (7, 11, 14)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 10, 11)>
- <6, (2, 8, 12)>
- <7, (0, 11, 13)>
- <10, (2, 4, 7)>
- <11, (0, 4, 7)>
- <14, (0, 11, 8)>
