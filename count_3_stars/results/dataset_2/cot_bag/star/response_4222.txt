Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 4 + 35 + 56 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 144 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [144].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<0, (7, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
