Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 21) (4, 29) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 22) (7, 26) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (5, 25) (5, 21) (6, 14) (6, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (20, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 22) (26, 3) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 8) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (10, 13) (10, 25) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 23) (8, 22) (8, 24) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 29) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 27) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 11) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 0) (28, 27) (3, 6) (3, 26) (1, 19) (1, 24) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 21) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by them.

1. Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (29, 18, 12). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 2.
2. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (29, 7, 24, 16). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
3. Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (4, 14, 22, 26). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
4. Node 13: It has 5 neighbors (15, 14, 10, 12, 17). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 13.
5. Node 16: It has 4 neighbors (4, 0, 25, 27). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 16.
6. Node 21: It has 4 neighbors (29, 5, 9, 23). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 21.
7. Node 22: It has 3 neighbors (7, 26, 8). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 22.
8. Node 24: It has 4 neighbors (4, 18, 8, 1). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 24.
9. Node 27: It has 5 neighbors (29, 19, 16, 11, 28). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 27.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 42 \]

Therefore, there are 42 3-stars in this graph. Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (29, 18, 12)>, <4, (29, 7, 24)>, <7, (4, 14, 26)>, <13, (15, 14, 10)>, <16, (4, 0, 25)>, <21, (29, 5, 9)>, <22, (7, 26, 8)>, <24, (4, 18, 8)>, <27, (29, 19, 11)>.
