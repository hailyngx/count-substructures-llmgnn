- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 5, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 10, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 11, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 1, 11, 0, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 10, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 3, 2, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 5, 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 11, 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 3, 5, 2, 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 12, 10.

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Calculating for each node:
- For node 0: 0 3-stars
- For node 1: 1 3-star
- For node 2: 2 3-stars
- For node 3: 2 3-stars
- For node 4: 2 3-stars
- For node 5: 1 3-star
- For node 6: 2 3-stars
- For node 7: 2 3-stars
- For node 8: 1 3-star
- For node 9: 2 3-stars
- For node 10: 2 3-stars
- For node 11: 2 3-stars
- For node 12: 2 3-stars
- For node 13: 2 3-stars
- For node 14: 2 3-stars

Summing up, we have a total of 25 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 14)>
<2, (9, 13, 10)>
<3, (1, 10, 13)>
<4, (0, 7, 4)>
