Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: 14, 5, 9, 8  
2: 7, 14, 12, 9  
3: 13, 9, 12  
4: 7, 8  
5: 1, 11, 6, 0  
6: 10, 11, 5  
7: 4, 2, 13, 8  
8: 4, 7, 1, 10, 11  
9: 1, 3, 0, 2, 13  
10: 11, 6, 8, 14  
11: 10, 13, 6, 8, 5  
12: 3, 2, 13  
13: 3, 11, 7, 0, 12, 9  
14: 1, 10, 0, 2  
	
Now, we can list the total number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 12 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 7 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 9, 8)>
- <1, (9, 2, 8)>
- <1, (9, 13, 5)>
- <1, (9, 13, 2)>
- <2, (7, 9, 8)>
- <2, (9, 13, 7)>
- <2, (9, 13, 12)>
- <2, (9, 13, 3)>
- <8, (4, 7, 11)>
- <8, (4, 7, 13)>
- <8, (7, 13, 11)>
- <8, (5, 13, 11)>
- <8, (10, 11, 13)>
- <8, (10, 11, 5)>
- <8, (11, 13, 5)>
- <8, (11, 13, 6)>
- <8, (11, 13, 0)>
- <8, (11, 13, 9)>
- <8, (11, 13, 12)>
- <9, (1, 3, 13)>
- <9, (1, 13, 2)>
- <9, (3, 12, 13)>
- <9, (12, 13, 2)>
- <11, (10, 6, 5)>
- <13, (0, 9, 2)>
