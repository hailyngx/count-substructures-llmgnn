Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6

Now let's find the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: No 3-stars.
- Node 2: 5 3-stars (3 with 0, 4, 7; 1 with 5, 8; 1 with 6, 9).
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: 3 3-stars (1 with 1, 2, 5; 1 with 2, 7, 8; 1 with 6, 7, 9).
- Node 5: No 3-stars.
- Node 6: 1 3-star (1 with 2, 4, 7).
- Node 7: 2 3-stars (1 with 2, 4, 8; 1 with 6, 8, 9).
- Node 8: No 3-stars.
- Node 9: No 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
