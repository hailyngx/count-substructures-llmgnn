For each node with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 25: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (27, 24, 16)>, <6, (1, 19, 24)>, <6, (15, 19, 6)>, <6, (15, 24, 6)>, <6, (19, 24, 6)>, <17, (3, 13, 15)>, <17, (12, 15, 27)>, <17, (13, 15, 16)>, <17, (13, 15, 20)>, <20, (7, 28, 20)>, <21, (0, 18, 25)>, <21, (0, 21, 28)>, <21, (0, 21, 25)>, <21, (18, 21, 28)>, <21, (21, 25, 28)>, <27, (8, 23, 24)>, <27, (23, 24, 27)>, <27, (27, 24, 4)>, <27, (27, 24, 16)>, <29, (4, 16, 18)>.
