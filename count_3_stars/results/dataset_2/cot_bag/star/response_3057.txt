Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 37 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Here are the unique 3-stars found within this graph:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
