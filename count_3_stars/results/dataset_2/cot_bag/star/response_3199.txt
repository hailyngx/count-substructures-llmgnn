Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 4, 9, 7, 1, 3, 12, 2, 6, 14, 13, 0.

For these nodes, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as:

\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{0}{3}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10, \binom{4}{3} = 4, \binom{9}{3} = 84, \binom{7}{3} = 35, \binom{1}{3} = 1, \binom{3}{3} = 1, \binom{12}{3} = 220, \binom{2}{3} = 1, \binom{6}{3} = 20, \binom{14}{3} = 364, \binom{13}{3} = 286, \binom{0}{3} = 0
\]

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 4 + 84 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 220 + 1 + 20 + 364 + 286 + 0 = 1026 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1026].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, 9, 4>, <5, 2, 11>, <5, 2, 12>, <5, 2, 13>, <9, 7, 4>, <9, 7, 12>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 1, 3>, <4, 1, 14>, <7, 1, 12>, <7, 1, 14>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 0>, <7, 12, 2>, <7, 12, 6>, <12, 2, 6>, <2, 11, 13>, <11, 13, 14>, <6, 5, 3>, <6, 5, 12>, <6, 3, 0>, <13, 11, 14>
