Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 3, 9, 13
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 12, 13, 2
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 10, 5, 3, 12, 1, 7
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 8, 11, 7, 0, 2
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 10, 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 2
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 13
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 8, 3, 2, 14
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 0, 12
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 13, 3, 14, 5, 12
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 9, 11, 2, 1
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 11, 1, 0
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 11, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed from nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (6, 9, 13)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (6, 3, 13)>, <0, (9, 3, 13)>

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<1, (9, 10, 12)>, <1, (9, 10, 13)>, <1, (9, 12, 13)>, <1, (10, 12, 13)>, <1, (10, 12, 2)>, <1, (10, 13, 2)>, <1, (12, 13, 2)>, <1, (9, 10, 2)>, <1, (9, 12, 2)>, <1, (9, 13, 2)>

- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<2, (10, 5, 3)>, <2, (10, 5, 12)>, <2, (10, 5, 1)>, <2, (10, 3, 12)>, <2, (10, 3, 1)>, <2, (10, 12, 1)>, <2, (5, 3, 12)>, <2, (5, 3, 1)>, <2, (5, 12, 1)>, <2, (3, 12, 1)>, <2, (10, 5, 7)>, <2, (10, 3, 7)>, <2, (10, 12, 7)>, <2, (10, 1, 7)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (5, 12, 7)>, <2, (5, 1, 7)>, <2, (3, 12, 7)>, <2, (3, 1, 7)>, <2, (12, 1, 7)>

- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (8, 11, 7)>, <3, (8, 11, 0)>, <3, (8, 11, 2)>, <3, (8, 7, 0)>, <3, (8, 7, 2)>, <3, (8, 0, 2)>, <3, (11, 7, 0)>, <3, (11, 7, 2)>, <3, (11, 0, 2)>, <3, (7, 0, 2)>

- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<11, (13, 14, 5)>, <11, (13, 14, 12)>, <11, (13, 14, 2)>, <11, (13, 5, 12)>, <11, (13, 5, 2)>, <11, (13, 12, 2)>, <11, (14, 5, 12)>, <11, (14, 5, 2)>, <11, (14, 12, 2)>, <11, (5, 12, 2)>

- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<13, (6, 8, 11)>, <13, (6, 8, 1)>, <13, (6, 8, 0)>, <13, (6, 11, 1)>, <13, (6, 11, 0)>, <13, (6, 1, 0)>, <13, (8, 11, 1)>, <13, (8, 11, 0)>, <13, (8, 1, 0)>, <13, (11, 1, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we get a total of 64 3-stars. 
So the final answer is [64].
