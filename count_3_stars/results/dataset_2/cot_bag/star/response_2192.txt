Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 14, 17, 6, 2, 7, 13, 16, 12, 18, 19, and 4.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (18, 7, 14). Number of 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
2. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (6, 18, 2). Number of 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
3. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (5, 17, 6, 7, 4). Number of 3-stars = C(5,3) = 10
4. Node 17 has 5 neighbors: (14, 13, 16, 4, 7). Number of 3-stars = C(5,3) = 10
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (9, 14, 12, 13). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
6. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8, 12, 15). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (5, 14, 17). Number of 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
8. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (17, 6, 1, 16). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
9. Node 16 has 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star).
10. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (6, 2, 3, 10). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
11. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (5, 9, 10). Number of 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
12. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (11, 1, 15, 4). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
13. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (14, 17, 15, 19). Number of 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all the nodes gives: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <5, (18, 7, 14)>, <9, (6, 18, 2)>, <14, (5, 17, 6)>, <14, (5, 7, 4)>, <17, (14, 13, 16)>, <6, (9, 14, 12)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <2, (9, 8, 12)>, <2, (9, 12, 15)>, <7, (5, 14, 17)>, <13, (6, 1, 16)>, <12, (6, 3, 10)>, <12, (2, 3, 10)>, <18, (5, 9, 10)>, <19, (11, 1, 15)>, <19, (11, 15, 4)>, <19, (1, 15, 4)>, <4, (14, 15, 19)>.
