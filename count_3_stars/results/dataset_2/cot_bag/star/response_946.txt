Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows: 

Node 0: (7, 1)  
Node 1: (7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 0)  
Node 2: (1, 3, 5, 8)  
Node 3: (4, 1, 9, 2, 5)  
Node 4: (9, 5, 6, 3)  
Node 5: (4, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8)  
Node 6: (4, 1, 5)  
Node 7: (0, 8, 1)  
Node 8: (7, 9, 5, 2)  
Node 9: (4, 3, 8)

Based on the given edges, here are the 3-stars in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars = [ ]  
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
