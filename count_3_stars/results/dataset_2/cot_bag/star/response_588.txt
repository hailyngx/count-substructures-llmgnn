Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 8) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 15>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 13, 16>, <1, 6, 16>, <1, 12, 6>, 
<1, 2, 17>, <1, 17, 7>, <2, 1, 16>, <3, 14, 16>, <3, 14, 19>, <4, 7, 13>, 
<4, 11, 2>, <5, 0, 3>, <7, 17, 2>, <7, 19, 14>, <8, 13, 16>, <10, 18, 8>, 
<10, 9, 0>, <13, 0, 10>.
