Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 0) (1, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 8) (5, 16) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (0, 18) (0, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 18, 15
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 7, 10, 6
- Node 3: 14, 6
- Node 4: 7, 18, 12, 13, 14
- Node 5: 16, 7
- Node 6: 3, 2
- Node 7: 4, 2, 5, 17
- Node 8: 1, 17, 15
- Node 9: 14, 16, 17
- Node 10: 18, 15, 2
- Node 11: 16, 19, 12
- Node 12: 11, 4, 15, 13
- Node 13: 4, 12, 14
- Node 14: 4, 13, 3, 9
- Node 15: 10, 0, 8, 12
- Node 16: 5, 9, 19, 11
- Node 17: 7, 8, 9
- Node 18: 4, 10, 0
- Node 19: 11, 16

After analyzing the nodes, we find that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [29] \).

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 18, 12)>
- <4, (7, 18, 13)>
- <4, (7, 12, 13)>
- <4, (18, 12, 13)>
- <4, (7, 12, 14)>
- <7, (4, 18, 12)>
- <7, (4, 18, 13)>
- <7, (4, 12, 13)>
- <7, (18, 12, 13)>
- <12, (4, 15, 13)>
- <12, (4, 15, 14)>
- <12, (15, 13, 14)>
- <12, (7, 15, 13)>
- <14, (3, 9, 16)>
- <15, (10, 0, 18)>
- <15, (10, 0, 8)>
- <15, (10, 8, 12)>
- <16, (9, 13, 14)>
- <16, (9, 14, 17)>
- <17, (8, 9, 15)>
- <18, (0, 10, 15)>
