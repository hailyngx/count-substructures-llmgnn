Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars.
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 39
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>.
