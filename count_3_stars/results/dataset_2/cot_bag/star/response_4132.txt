Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 3) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14.   
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 5, 13, and 12.
- The number of 3-stars for node 1 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  
For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 11, 0, 14, and 6.
- The number of 3-stars for node 3 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, and 3.
- The number of 3-stars for node 4 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 5, 14, and 12.
- The number of 3-stars for node 8 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10, 2, and 12.
- The number of 3-stars for node 9 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 9, and 5.
- The number of 3-stars for node 10 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 10, 6, 14, and 2.
- The number of 3-stars for node 13 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 8, 13, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars for node 14 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated from each node, we have a total of \(10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 104\) 3-stars in this graph.

So the total number of 3-stars is [104].
