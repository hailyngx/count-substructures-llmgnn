Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 0) (7, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 2) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 11, 15, 2, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (16, 19, 13). So, there is only 1 3-star with node 11 as the center: <11, (16, 19, 13)>.

2. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (10, 9, 8, 5). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the center: <15, (10, 9, 8)>, <15, (10, 9, 5)>, <15, (10, 8, 5)>, <15, (9, 8, 5)>.

3. Node 2 also has 4 neighbors: (17, 5, 9, 18). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (17, 5, 9)>, <2, (17, 5, 18)>, <2, (17, 9, 18)>, <2, (5, 9, 18)>.

4. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (16, 17, 6, 13). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center: <14, (16, 17, 6)>, <14, (16, 17, 13)>, <14, (16, 6, 13)>, <14, (17, 6, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 11) + 4 (from node 15) + 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 14) = 13. 
So, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
