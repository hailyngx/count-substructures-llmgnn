Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 18) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (15, 4) (15, 6) (16, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 4, 1, 3, 10, 17, 2, 18, 6, 0, 14, 13, 15, 11, 5, 9, 12, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we have a total of 41 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <4, (6, 15, 9)>, <1, (3, 10, 19)>, <3, (1, 14, 18)>, <10, (1, 17, 5)>, <17, (10, 19, 11)>, <2, (10, 13, 18)>, <18, (3, 2, 0)>, <6, (4, 13, 15)>, <0, (18, 11, 19)>, <14, (3, 16, 19)>, <13, (2, 6, 12)>, <11, (7, 17, 0)>, <19, (1, 17, 0)>.
