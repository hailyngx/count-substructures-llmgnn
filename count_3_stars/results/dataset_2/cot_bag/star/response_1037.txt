Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7, 9, 4, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 10, 6, 2, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {10, 0, 9, 14, 5, 13}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 10, 7, 4}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 6, 5, 13, 8}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 0, 8, 4}
- Node 11: neighbors {14, 13, 6, 8}
- Node 13: neighbors {11, 7, 2, 4}
- Node 14: neighbors {11, 12, 4}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
