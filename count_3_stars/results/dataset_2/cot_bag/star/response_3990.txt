Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. These nodes are as follows:

Node 5: Neighbors (9, 6, 15)
Node 9: Neighbors (5, 19)
Node 14: Neighbors (17, 0, 7)
Node 17: Neighbors (14, 12, 11)
Node 18: Neighbors (10, 2, 6, 7)
Node 6: Neighbors (5, 18, 11, 12, 4)
Node 8: Neighbors (2, 12, 3)
Node 0: Neighbors (14, 7, 4)
Node 3: Neighbors (8, 11, 19)
Node 11: Neighbors (17, 6, 3, 15)
Node 7: Neighbors (14, 18, 0, 15)
Node 4: Neighbors (6, 0, 19)
Node 19: Neighbors (9, 3, 4, 1, 13)
Node 12: Neighbors (17, 6, 8, 13)

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:

<Node 5, (9, 6, 15)> = 1
<Node 9, (5, 19, 13)>
<Node 14, (17, 0, 7)> = 1
<Node 17, (14, 12, 11)> = 1
<Node 18, (10, 2, 6)> = 1
<Node 6, (5, 11, 12)>
<Node 8, (2, 12, 3)> = 1
<Node 0, (14, 4, 7)> = 1
<Node 3, (8, 11, 19)> = 1
<Node 11, (17, 6, 15)> = 1
<Node 7, (14, 0, 15)> = 1
<Node 4, (6, 19, 0)>
<Node 19, (9, 13, 4)>
<Node 12, (17, 8, 13)> = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [9]. 

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 15)>
<9, (5, 19, 13)>
<14, (17, 0, 7)>
<17, (14, 12, 11)>
<18, (10, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 11, 12)>
<8, (2, 12, 3)>
<0, (14, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 11, 19)>
<11, (17, 6, 15)>
<7, (14, 0, 15)>
<4, (6, 19, 0)>
<19, (9, 13, 4)>
<12, (17, 8, 13)>
