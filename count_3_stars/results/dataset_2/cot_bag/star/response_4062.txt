Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

First, let's examine each node and check how many neighbors it has.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (21, 2, 14, 19), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (10, 11, 6, 9), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (3, 2, 25, 6), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (17, 20, 3, 2, 28), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors (17, 3, 18, 22, 29), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 18, 13), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (10, 9, 15, 26), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors (10, 11, 29, 15, 13), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors (20, 16, 28, 4, 13), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (17, 12, 24, 27), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors (9, 22, 4, 23), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

There are 8 total 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (21, 2, 14)>
<3, (10, 11, 9)>
<6, (3, 2, 25)>
<9, (17, 20, 3)>
<10, (17, 3, 22)>
<11, (0, 18, 13)>
<18, (10, 11, 29)>
<23, (20, 16, 28)>
