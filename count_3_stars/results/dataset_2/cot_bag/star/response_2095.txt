Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 13. So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is  \({3 \choose 3} = 1\).

- Node 2: There are 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 3: There are 4 neighbors, but it's not connected to 3 different nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 4: There are 5 neighbors: 5, 12, 13, 14, 3. So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \({5 \choose 3} = 10\).

- Node 5: There are 4 neighbors: 9, 13, 2, 4. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 6: There are 4 neighbors: 11, 12, 14, 0. So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 8: There are 4 neighbors: 10, 12, 0, 3. So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 9: There are 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 10, 13. So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 10: There are 5 neighbors: 9, 11, 3, 1, 2. So, the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \({5 \choose 3} = 10\).

- Node 11: There are 5 neighbors: 10, 14, 7, 6, 12. So, the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \({5 \choose 3} = 10\).

- Node 12: There are 5 neighbors: 7, 4, 14, 6, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center is \({5 \choose 3} = 10\).

- Node 13: There are 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 1. So, the number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is \({4 \choose 3} = 4\).

- Node 14: There are 5 neighbors: 11, 12, 4, 3, 6. So, the number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center is \({5 \choose 3} = 10\).

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of $1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 75$.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [75].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 9, 10)>, <4, (5, 12, 13)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (11, 12, 14)>, <8, (10, 12, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 13)>, <10, (9, 11, 3)>, <11, (10, 14, 7)>, <12, (7, 4, 14)>, <13, (5, 9, 1)>, <14, (11, 12, 4)>
