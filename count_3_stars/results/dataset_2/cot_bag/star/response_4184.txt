Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 16) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 1) (8, 19) (8, 3) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 13) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them out:

- Node 9: <9, (2, 14, 10)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 0, 11)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 15, 13)>
- Node 10: <10, (9, 11, 17)>
- Node 11: <11, (4, 10, 17)>
- Node 17: <17, (10, 11, 3)>
- Node 0: <0, (4, 14, 12)>
- Node 14: <14, (9, 0, 1)>
- Node 19: <19, (5, 8, 3)>
- Node 1: <1, (14, 15, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (19, 3, -)>
- Node 18: <18, (12, 13, -)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 18, 13)>
- Node 16: <16, (7, 17, 19)>

We can see that there are 13 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
