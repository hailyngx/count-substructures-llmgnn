Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: (60 edges, 6 nodes)* = 20 3-stars
- Node 2: (60 edges, 7 nodes)* = 35 3-stars
- Node 3: (60 edges, 5 nodes)* = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: (60 edges, 7 nodes)* = 35 3-stars
- Node 7: (60 edges, 6 nodes)* = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: (60 edges, 4 nodes)* = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: (60 edges, 5 nodes)* = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: (60 edges, 5 nodes)* = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: (60 edges, 6 nodes)* = 20 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 35 + 10 + 35 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 164.

Answer: [164]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 8, 12)>
<2, (0, 8, 10)>
<3, (0, 13, 10)>
<6, (4, 13, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 13)>
<8, (2, 12, 11)>
<11, (8, 9, 14)>
<13, (5, 6, 7)>
<14, (5, 11, 12)>
