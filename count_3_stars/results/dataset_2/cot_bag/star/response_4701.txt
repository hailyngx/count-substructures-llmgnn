Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 16) (18, 11) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 2) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 16) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 4) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 11) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these contributions together: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 19>
- <0, 8, 11>
- <0, 11, 18>
- <4, 2, 7>
- <4, 2, 17>
- <4, 2, 16>
- <4, 13, 14>
- <4, 13, 19>
- <6, 10, 16>
- <6, 10, 11>
- <13, 4, 19>
- <13, 4, 14>
- <15, 12, 17>
- <15, 12, 16>
- <15, 16, 18>
- <16, 10, 6>
- <17, 2, 7>
- <17, 2, 6>
- <19, 13, 14>
