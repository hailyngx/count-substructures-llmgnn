Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 11) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 10) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 7) (22, 21) (1, 2) (17, 5) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 15) (3, 21) (3, 23) (11, 25) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 12) (21, 22) (21, 3) (21, 11) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 16) (10, 14) (10, 23) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 27) (2, 15) (7, 22) (7, 16) (7, 27) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 10) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 15) (12, 11) (8, 15) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (27, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Nodes 5, 9, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, and 28 meet this criterion.

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 22: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 25: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 28: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [35].

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 17, 23)>
- <9, (5, 18, 28)>
- <9, (18, 4, 28)>
- <9, (18, 28, 29)>
- <18, (9, 4, 27)>
- <19, (0, 14, 29)>
- <19, (14, 17, 29)>
- <19, (17, 23, 29)>
- <19, (29, 14, 17)>
- <22, (9, 2, 21)>
- <22, (21, 2, 7)>
- <22, (21, 7, 11)>
- <25, (20, 11, 26)>
- <25, (20, 15, 2)>
- <25, (11, 15, 26)>
- <25, (11, 15, 2)>
- <26, (25, 11, 16)>
- <26, (25, 2, 16)>
- <28, (9, 24, 4)>
- <28, (4, 18, 27)>
