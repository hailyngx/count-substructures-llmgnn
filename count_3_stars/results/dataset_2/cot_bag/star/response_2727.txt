Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors
Node 11: 4 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 4, 6), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

For nodes with 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 9, 13, 14), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

For nodes with 3 neighbors (nodes 11, 12), there is only 1 3-star each.

Summing them up: 
\( 4 \times 10 + 5 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 40 + 20 + 2 = 62 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (5, 11, 14)>, <1, (3, 4, 12)>, <4, (1, 3, 13)>, <6, (8, 11, 13)>, <14, (0, 6, 7)>.
