Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at those nodes.

The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
