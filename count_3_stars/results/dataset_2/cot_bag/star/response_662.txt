Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 5, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- The number of 3-stars formed by node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- The unique 3-stars formed by node 5 are: <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- The number of 3-stars formed by node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- The unique 3-stars formed by node 6 are: <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars formed by node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- The unique 3-stars formed by node 7 are: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 12 different 3-stars in this graph. So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
