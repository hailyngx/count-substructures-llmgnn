Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 18) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 9) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 16) (18, 15) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in the given graph: nodes 4, 9, 3, and 16.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (9, 0, 11)>
  - <4, (9, 16, 11)>
  - <4, (9, 0, 16)>
  - <4, (0, 16, 11)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (4, 15, 19)>
  - <9, (4, 15, 17)>
  - <9, (4, 19, 17)>
  - <9, (15, 19, 17)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (7, 1, 14)>
  - <3, (7, 1, 8)>
  - <3, (7, 14, 8)>
  - <3, (7, 8, 10)>
  - <3, (7, 8, 12)>
  - <3, (1, 14, 8)>
  - <3, (14, 8, 10)>
  - <3, (14, 8, 12)>
  - <3, (8, 10, 12)>
  - <3, (14, 10, 12)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <16, (4, 14, 18)>
  - <16, (4, 12, 18)>
  - <16, (4, 12, 16)>
  - <16, (14, 12, 18)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
