Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 17, 9, 19, 5
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 11, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 16, 15
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 17, 7, 5, 8
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 17, 9, 0, 6
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 10, 11, 19, 5
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 14, 8, 1
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 10, 13, 9
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 12, 6
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 2, 18, 15, 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 14, 13, 0
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 10, 12
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 13, 2, 3
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 14, 4, 11, 8, 15
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 19, 12, 16
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 4, 1
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 4, 12, 5

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].
Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <14, (17, 9, 19)>
- <17, (14, 13, 11)>
- <4, (5, 16, 15)>
- <11, (17, 7, 5)>
- <13, (17, 9, 0)>
- <8, (10, 11, 19)>
- <19, (14, 8, 1)>
- <0, (10, 13, 9)>
- <5, (14, 4, 11)>
- <12, (2, 18, 15)>
- <1, (19, 12, 16)>
