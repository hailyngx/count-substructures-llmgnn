Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.  

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10\]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10\]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 9:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Summing all the 3-stars, we have: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20] = 55 \] 

Therefore, there are 55 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>
