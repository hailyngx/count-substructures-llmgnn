Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 3, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9, 3
- Node 3: 4, 6, 2, 8, 0
- Node 4: 7, 9, 6, 3
- Node 5: 7, 6, 1, 0
- Node 6: 4, 5, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4, 9, 5
- Node 8: 6, 2, 3, 1
- Node 9: 4, 7, 2, 0, 1

Now, we will go through each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: [1] 3-star
- Node 1: [1] 3-star
- Node 2: [0] 3-stars
- Node 3: [1] 3-star
- Node 4: [1] 3-star
- Node 5: [1] 3-star
- Node 6: [1] 3-star
- Node 7: [0] 3-stars
- Node 8: [1] 3-star
- Node 9: [1] 3-star

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars:
<0, (5, 3, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 2, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 6, 3)>, <5, (7, 6, 1, 0)>, <6, (4, 5, 1, 3, 8)>, <8, (6, 2, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 2, 0, 1)>
