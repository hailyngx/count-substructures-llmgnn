Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph along with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {9, 3, 4, 12, 5}
- Node 1: {10, 14, 13, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {0, 14, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {11, 0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {10, 0, 14, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 11, 2, 13, 8}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {14, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 8, 1, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 7, 13, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {11, 1, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {9, 3, 1, 5}

Based on the nodes and their neighbors, we identify the following 3-stars: 
Total number of 3-stars = [8]
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (9, 4, 12)>
- <0, (5, 3, 12)>
- <1, (10, 14, 13)>
- <1, (4, 11, 1)>
- <4, (0, 5, 1)>
- <7, (9, 11, 13)>
- <7, (11, 8, 10)>
- <12, (0, 3, 13)>
