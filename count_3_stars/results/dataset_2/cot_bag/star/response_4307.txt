Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 6, 9, 11, 8, 4, 7, 12, 17, 3, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <6, (1, 3, 12)>
    
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
    - <9, (6, 7, 18)>
    
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <11, (10, 4, 2)>
    
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <8, (4, 2, 19)>
    
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <4, (11, 8, 13)>
    
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
    - <7, (9, 3, 19)>
    
- Node 12 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
    
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <17, (10, 18, 2)>
    
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <3, (6, 7, 17)>, <3, (6, 5, 14)>, <3, (7, 17, 14)>, <3, (17, 18, 16)>, <3, (5, 0, 11)>

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
    - <19, (8, 7, 18)>
    
Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [29]
