Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars. Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the nodes listed above:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the combinations above:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 84, and we can represent them as follows:
