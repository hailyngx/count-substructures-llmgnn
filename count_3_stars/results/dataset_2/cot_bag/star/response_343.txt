Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 13) (15, 4) (15, 28) (6, 18) (6, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 13) (21, 25) (21, 22) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 19) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 11) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 25) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 26) (27, 25) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 4) (12, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 5) (20, 22) (20, 1) (24, 3) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 8) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts, we get a total of 70 3-stars. So, the final answer is [70].
