Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8  
Node 1: 0, 6, 9  
Node 2: 3, 5, 6  
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 4: 3, 6, 9  
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7  
Node 6: 1, 4, 2, 8  
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9  
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9  
Node 9: 1, 4, 7 ,8  

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Total number of 3-stars = 42  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 0, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 8, 4)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>.
