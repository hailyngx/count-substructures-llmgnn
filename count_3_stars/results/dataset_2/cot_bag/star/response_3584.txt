Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (22, 10) (22, 15) (22, 29) (23, 3) (23, 28) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 14) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 11) (5, 26) (5, 8) (19, 8) (19, 9) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (29, 1) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 11) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 25) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 28) (12, 3) (11, 21) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 29) (15, 22) (3, 23) (3, 20) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (25, 21) (25, 8) (4, 17) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (21, 6, 29, 27). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 21: It has 4 neighbors (1, 16, 11, 25). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 22: It has 3 neighbors (10, 15, 29). So, it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 26: It has 4 neighbors (13, 5, 11, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 29: It has 4 neighbors (1, 22, 9, 11). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 12: It has 4 neighbors (16, 24, 28, 3). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (21, 6, 29)>, <1, (21, 6, 27)>, <1, (21, 29, 27)>, <21, (1, 16, 11)>, <21, (1, 16, 25)>, <21, (1, 11, 25)>, <22, (10, 15, 29)>, <26, (13, 5, 11)>, <26, (13, 5, 8)>, <26, (13, 11, 8)>, <26, (5, 11, 8)>, <29, (1, 22, 9)>, <29, (1, 22, 11)>, <29, (1, 9, 11)>, <29, (22, 9, 11)>, <12, (16, 24, 28)>, <12, (16, 24, 3)>, <12, (16, 28, 3)>, <12, (24, 28, 3)>.
