Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 11, 16, 3, 10, 9, 18, 6, 19, and 2. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (16, 10, 19) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (11, 12, 9, 15) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (1, 6, 13, 18) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (11, 0, 9, 14) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (16, 10, 4, 8) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (3, 4, 8, 13) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (3, 7, 5, 2, 19) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: (11, 4, 8, 7, 6) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6, 14) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 38 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
