Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 2) (26, 28) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 19) (29, 16) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 12) (20, 2) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 8) (0, 16) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 1) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 6) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 12) (17, 6) (17, 12) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 13) (5, 13) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 11) (21, 18) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 28) (1, 10) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 11) (19, 29) (19, 8) (16, 29) (16, 0) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 10) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 7) (6, 8) (6, 23) (6, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 20) (28, 26) (28, 22) (28, 20) (28, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( 0 \) 3-stars
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node, total \( 4*8 = 32 \) 3-stars
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node, total 10

Adding the 3-stars together, we have a total of \( 32 + 10 = 42 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
