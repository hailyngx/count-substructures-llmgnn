Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 16) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 8) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 12) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 0) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 4) (15, 22) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 16) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 0) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 8) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 20) (14, 11) (14, 24) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 0) (2, 23) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 29) (12, 19) (20, 11) (20, 23) (4, 26) (4, 2) (19, 9) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 12) (24, 29) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 22) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 15) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 25) (23, 2) (23, 20)

- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4

- Node 29: degree 4

We see that only the nodes with degrees 3, 4, or 5 can potentially form 3-star structures. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors (degree = 3): 1 3-star each
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
Total: 7 3-stars

Nodes with 4 neighbors (degree = 4): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- Node 0: 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 3-stars
- Node 21: 4 3-stars
- Node 22: 4 3-stars
- Node 25: 4 3-stars
- Node 27: 4 3-stars
- Node 29: 4 3-stars
Total: 52 3-stars

Nodes with 5 neighbors (degree = 5): \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- Node 6: 10 3-stars
- Node 21: 10 3-stars
- Node 22: 10 3-stars
Total: 30 3-stars

Putting all the 3-stars together, we have:
<1, (0, 18, 25)>, <1, (0, 18, 27)>, <1, (0, 18, 9)>, <1, (0, 25, 27)>, <1, (18, 25, 27)>, <8, (0, 21, 25)>, <8, (0, 21, 27)>, <8, (0, 21, 9)>, <8, (0, 25, 27)>, <8, (21, 25, 27)>, <9, (18, 19, 29)>, <9, (18, 19, 12)>, <9, (18, 27, 29)>, <9, (18, 27, 12)>, <9, (19, 29, 12)>, <9, (27, 29, 12)>, <11, (1, 14, 20)>, <11, (1, 14, 24)>, <11, (1, 20, 24)>, <11, (14, 20, 24)>, <12, (17, 19, 29)>, <12, (17, 29, 24)>, <12, (19, 29, 24)>, <12, (21, 19, 29)>, <12, (21, 19, 12)>, <12, (21, 29, 24)>, <12, (29, 24, 27)>, <19, (9, 21, 29)>, <19, (12, 21, 29)>, <19, (12, 21, 19)>, <19, (12, 21, 27)>, <21, (8, 22, 29)>, <21, (8, 22, 24)>, <21, (22, 29, 24)>, <21, (25, 22, 24)>, <21, (27, 22, 24)>, <22, (11, 14, 24)>, <22, (11, 20, 24)>, <22, (15, 24, 29)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [89].
