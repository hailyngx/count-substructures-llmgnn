Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 25) (1, 22) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 12) (25, 1) (25, 3) (25, 14) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (22, 1) (22, 15) (22, 17) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (19, 4) (19, 10) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 23) (27, 8) (27, 17) (21, 16) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 24) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 2) (29, 24) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 23) (18, 8) (23, 28) (23, 18) (23, 4) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 10) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 4) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 2) (24, 17) (17, 22) (17, 27) (17, 24) (12, 3) (12, 14) (8, 27) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 6) (14, 25) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find potential 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each relevant node:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (9, 15, 13)>
<9, (5, 13, 11)>
<9, (13, 11, 7)>
<9, (13, 7, 11)>
<9, (11, 7, 13)>
<9, (11, 13, 7)>
<10, (3, 19, 29)>
<10, (19, 29, 24)>
<10, (29, 24, 2)>
<10, (24, 2, 4)>
<10, (2, 4, 10)>
<10, (4, 10, 3)>
<10, (4, 10, 29)>
<10, (4, 10, 2)>
<10, (24, 2, 10)>
<10, (2, 10, 29)>
<10, (3, 10, 19)>
<24, (2, 17, 29)>
<24, (17, 29, 18)>
<24, (29, 18, 8)>
<24, (18, 8, 27)>
<28, (0, 16, 23)>
