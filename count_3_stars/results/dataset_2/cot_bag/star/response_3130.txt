Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 22) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 15) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 12) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 20) (17, 7) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 21) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 0) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 10) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (23, 3) (23, 29) (11, 15) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 10) (25, 9) (25, 16) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 20) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 5) (24, 27) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 15) (20, 4) (20, 2) (20, 14) (20, 27) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 25) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:  
Node 3, Node 4, Node 12, Node 15, Node 18, Node 22, Node 28, and Node 29.  

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41 \)

So, there are a total of 41 3-stars in this graph.

Final answer: [41]  
Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 10, 22)>, <4, (12, 15, 29)>, <12, (4, 6, 10)>, <15, (0, 11, 13)>, <18, (2, 9, 28)>, <22, (5, 13, 18)>, <28, (10, 14, 17)>, <29, (16, 23, 25)>
