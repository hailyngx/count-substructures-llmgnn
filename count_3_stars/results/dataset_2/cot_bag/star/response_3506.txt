Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 3) (29, 28) (29, 19) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 24) (20, 2) (20, 14) (5, 24) (6, 15) (6, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 17) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 6) (10, 22) (21, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 25) (24, 5) (17, 26) (17, 12) (17, 23) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 11, 15, 2, 28, 19, 3, 24, 4, 18, 22, 23, 7, 8, 14, 10, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.

For node 11: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 15: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 28: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 24: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 22: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 23: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 10: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
For node 12: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1] = [53]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (28, 24, 0)>, <15, (16, 27, 7)>, <15, (23, 7, 6)>, <15, (23, 4, 13)>, <15, (23, 17, 13)>, <15, (7, 18, 13)>, <28, (29, 19, 8)>, <28, (23, 4, 13)>, <28, (23, 17, 13)>, <28, (0, 14, 8)>, <19, (26, 9, 12)>, <3, (2, 25, 4)>, <24, (11, 25, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 18)>, <18, (7, 21, 17)>, <22, (26, 10, 12)>, <8, (28, 14, 0)>, <8, (14, 9, 13)>, <14, (20, 0, 8)>, <12, (22, 17, 9)>
