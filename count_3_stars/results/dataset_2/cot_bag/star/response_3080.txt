Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8  
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7  
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7  
Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7  
Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 8  
Node 6: 2, 4, 8, 9  
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5  
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5  
Node 9: 0, 6  

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

From the given information, we can see that nodes with at least 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

For Node 0: 
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <0, (4, 8, 9)>

For Node 1:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:
  - <2, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (3, 4, 6)>

For Node 3:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <3, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (2, 7, 5)>
  - <3, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <3, (1, 5, 7)>

For Node 4:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <4, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 7, 5)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 5)>

For Node 5:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:
  - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <5, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 3, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:
  - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 9)>

For Node 8:
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:
  - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 3)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars together and counting them, we get a total of 32 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [32].
