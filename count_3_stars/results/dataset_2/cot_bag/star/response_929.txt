Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 7}

Now, we can determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 2 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
