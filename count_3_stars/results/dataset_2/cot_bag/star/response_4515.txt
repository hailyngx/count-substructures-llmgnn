Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 20) (1, 11) (21, 7) (21, 10) (7, 21) (7, 29) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 15) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 23) (6, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 2) (0, 6) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 24) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 26) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 9) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 20) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 27) (9, 14) (9, 10) (15, 22) (15, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 0) (23, 15) (27, 11) (27, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (20, 16) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 11, 16, 1, 29, 21, 7, 18, 22, 3, 25, 8, 13, 6, 28, 0, 19, 26, 24, 17, 10, 12, 2, 5, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<11, 16, 29>, <18, 25, 13>, <10, 5, 20>, <10, 5, 4>, <10, 19, 24>, <17, 12, 8>, <17, 12, 5>, <17, 12, 16>, <17, 13, 8>, <17, 13, 5>, <17, 13, 23>, <10, 21, 7>, <10, 19, 26>, <10, 9, 14>, <23, 25, 3>, <23, 15, 22>, <23, 15, 0>, <20, 16, 12>, <20, 16, 29>
