Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 5, 9, 11, 13, 4, 0, 1, 3, 6, 12

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 77 \)

Thus, there are 77 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us: [77]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 11, 13)>
- <11, (1, 8, 10)>
- <13, (14, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 10)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 11)>
- <3, (2, 6, 12)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <12, (3, 6, 14)>
