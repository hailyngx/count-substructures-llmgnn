Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [C(3, 3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [C(3, 3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 4: [C(5, 3)] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [C(3, 3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [C(3, 3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [C(4, 3)] = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 22 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <2, (7, 1, 8)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>.
