Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 23) (15, 0) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 28) (2, 17) (2, 8) (29, 13) (29, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 12) (22, 6) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (9, 18) (9, 21) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (21, 26) (21, 9) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 22) (5, 29) (5, 28) (23, 3) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 12) (11, 15) (24, 8) (24, 27) (27, 16) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 25) (25, 14) (25, 16) (25, 19) (28, 4) (28, 7) (28, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, and 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: ${15\choose 3} = 455$
- Node 4: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 8: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 10: ${3\choose 3} = 1$
- Node 12: ${5\choose 3} = 10$
- Node 13: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 14: ${3\choose 3} = 1$
- Node 16: ${5\choose 3} = 10$
- Node 18: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 19: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 20: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 23: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 26: ${4\choose 3} = 4$
- Node 28: ${3\choose 3} = 1$

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node gives: \(455 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 500\)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 500, which we represent as [500].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 15, 16)>
<4, (0, 7, 28)>
<7, (4, 19, 20)>
<8, (2, 12, 24)>
<10, (6, 16, 17)>
<12, (8, 13, 23)>
<13, (4, 12, 29)>
<14, (17, 25, 26)>
<16, (0, 10, 27)>
<18, (9, 12, 26)>
<19, (7, 13, 25)>
<20, (7, 23, 27)>
<23, (12, 20, 26)>
<26, (18, 21, 23)>
<28, (5, 7, 29)>
