Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5

Based on the degrees, the nodes that could potentially form 3-stars are: 1, 4, 5, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 12)>
- <1, (4, 5, 14)>
- <1, (4, 7, 14)>
- <1, (5, 7, 14)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 12)>
- <4, (1, 5, 14)>
- <4, (1, 7, 14)>
- <4, (5, 7, 14)>
- <5, (1, 4, 14)>
- <5, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 5, 12)>
- <5, (1, 5, 14)>
- <5, (1, 7, 14)>
- <5, (4, 7, 14)>
- <14, (1, 4, 5)>
- <14, (1, 4, 7)>
- <14, (1, 5, 7)>
- <14, (4, 5, 7)>
