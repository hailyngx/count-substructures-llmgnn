Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 2) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 13) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 18) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 11) (23, 25) (23, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 18) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 14) (26, 24) (26, 0) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (17, 12) (17, 1) (21, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 25) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 19) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 19) (0, 26) (0, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 8) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 0) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 20) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 11) (4, 26) (4, 20) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 2, 29, 18, 22, 27, 6, 9, 10, 12, 17, 21, 13, 14, 7, 16, 0, 25, 5, 8, 26, 20.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [33]

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (15, 21, 2)>, <18, (29, 27, 22)>, <18, (27, 22, 11)>, <18, (27, 23, 12)>, <18, (27, 7, 12)>, <18, (22, 27, 11)>, <18, (22, 27, 7)>, <18, (22, 11, 19)>, <27, (12, 7, 24)>, <7, (27, 16, 24)>, <7, (27, 10, 24)>, <7, (27, 10, 16)>, <7, (24, 16, 14)>, <7, (10, 16, 25)>, <7, (10, 16, 19)>, <7, (10, 24, 28)>, <7, (24, 14, 28)>, <10, (6, 9, 7)>, <25, (0, 23, 26)>.
