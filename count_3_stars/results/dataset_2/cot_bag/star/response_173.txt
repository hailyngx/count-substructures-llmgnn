Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 4) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 9) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 10) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 16) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 11, 17)>,
<3, (8, 4, 10)>,
<4, (8, 3, 10)>,
<4, (8, 11, 19)>,
<4, (10, 18, 2)>,
<8, (3, 4, 0)>,
<10, (9, 19, 18)>,
<15, (3, 7, 0)>,
<17, (3, 18, 0)>,
<18, (5, 19, 4)>.
