Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: (6)
- Node 1: (5, 9, 3, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 2: (5, 6, 1, 7)
- Node 3: (5, 1)
- Node 4: (9, 1, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 5: (9, 2, 8, 1, 3)
- Node 6: (9, 7, 2, 0)
- Node 7: (9, 6, 4, 2)
- Node 8: (5, 1, 4)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 4, 1, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, there are 50 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is [50].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>
