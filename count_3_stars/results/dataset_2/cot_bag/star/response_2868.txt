Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 13, 4, 14, 10, 11
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 10
- Node 2 is connected to 5, 6, 9, 12, 7
- Node 3 is connected to 4, 9, 12, 10, 7
- Node 4 is connected to 13, 12, 0, 14, 3
- Node 5 is connected to 2, 1, 10
- Node 6 is connected to 2
- Node 7 is connected to 13, 14, 9, 2, 3
- Node 8 is connected to 13, 9, 14, 12
- Node 9 is connected to 8, 2, 11, 3, 7
- Node 10 is connected to 5, 0, 12, 1, 3
- Node 11 is connected to 0, 9
- Node 12 is connected to 8, 4, 2, 10, 3
- Node 13 is connected to 8, 4, 7, 0
- Node 14 is connected to 8, 4, 0, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [8]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 4, 14)>
<2, (5, 10, 12)>
<3, (4, 10, 12)>
<4, (13, 0, 14)>
<7, (13, 14, 9)>
<8, (13, 9, 14)>
<9, (2, 11, 3)>
<10, (5, 0, 12)>
