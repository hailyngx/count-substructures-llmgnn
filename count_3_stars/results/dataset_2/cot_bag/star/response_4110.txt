Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 
Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 67 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [67].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
