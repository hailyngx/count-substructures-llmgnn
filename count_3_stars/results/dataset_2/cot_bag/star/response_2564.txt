Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 16) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 3: {6, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 16}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 11, 16}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 16}
- Node 9: {10}
- Node 10: {9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 5}
- Node 12: {1, 13, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 10}
- Node 15: {1, 13, 17}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 8, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {15}
- Node 18: {13}
- Node 19: {3, 16}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, 16

Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 1: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 5: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 13: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 16: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 53

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 7, 13)>
- <1, (0, 7, 13)>
- <2, (13, 15, 18)>
- <5, (6, 7, 16)>
- <6, (0, 14, 16)>
- <7, (0, 1, 13)>
- <13, (1, 7, 15)>
- <16, (4, 12, 19)>
