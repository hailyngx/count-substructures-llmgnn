Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 5) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
There are three nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 6, node 9, and node 10. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 11, and 4.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 4 neighbors of node 6.
- So, there are 4 different 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 7, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (7, 11, 4)>, and <6, (1, 11, 4)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13.
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors out of the 3 neighbors of node 9.
- So, there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 11, 13)>.

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 2.
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors out of the 3 neighbors of node 10.
- So, there is 1 3-star with node 10 as the center: <10, (3, 1, 2)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <6, (1, 7, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (7, 11, 4)>, <6, (1, 11, 4)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>, <10, (3, 1, 2)>.
