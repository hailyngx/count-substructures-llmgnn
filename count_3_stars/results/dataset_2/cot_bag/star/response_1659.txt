Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (15, 4) (15, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 16) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 5, 10, 11, 4, 8, 13, 17, 3, 0, 12, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <10, (11, 3, 4)>, <11, (10, 6, 17)>, <13, (5, 0, 17)>, <13, (0, 17, 1)>, <13, (17, 1, 5)>, <13, (1, 5, 13)>, <17, (11, 13, 16)>, <17, (13, 1, 7)>, <17, (1, 7, 11)>, <17, (7, 11, 17)>, <3, (10, 14, 7)>, <3, (19, 14, 7)>, <3, (14, 7, 10)>, <3, (7, 10, 14)>, <0, (2, 15, 6)>, <0, (15, 6, 2)>, <0, (6, 2, 0)>, <12, (2, 14, 19)>, <14, (10, 12, 3)>
