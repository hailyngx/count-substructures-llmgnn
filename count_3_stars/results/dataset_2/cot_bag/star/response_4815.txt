Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (9, 0), (3, 0), (8, 0), (0, 9). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (5, 2), (9, 2), (3, 2), (6, 2). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2. 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (9, 3), (7, 3), (0, 3), (2, 3), (8, 3). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 3. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (5, 4), (7, 4), (1, 4), (8, 4), (6, 4). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.  
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: (9, 8), (4, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 6). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 8. 
- Node 9 has 9 neighbors: (5, 9), (9, 5), (8, 9), (0, 9), (4, 9), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7). So, there are \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars formed with node 9. 

Adding these up:  
4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 20 (from node 8) + 84 (from node 9) = 132.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [132]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (8, 3, 0)>, <0, (9, 0, 3)>, <0, (9, 0, 8)>, 
<2, (9, 2, 5)>, <2, (9, 3, 2)>, <2, (9, 2, 6)>,
<3, (9, 3, 7)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 3, 0)>, <3, (8, 4, 3)>,
<4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 4)>, <4, (6, 8, 4)>,
<8, (8, 4, 1)>, <8, (8, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 8, 4)>, 
<9, (9, 2, 5)>, <9, (9, 3, 7)>, <9, (9, 7, 4)>, <9, (9, 8, 0)>.
