Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 15) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 23) (21, 2) (21, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 20) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 16) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 19) (29, 24) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (26, 24) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 18) (5, 8) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 10) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 2) (16, 28) (16, 6) (4, 2) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 19) (25, 27) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (7, 10) (7, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 23) (14, 20) (14, 27) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 21, 20, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <21, (1, 2, 15)>
   - <21, (1, 9, 23)>
   - <21, (1, 15, 2)>
   - <21, (1, 15, 10)>
   - <21, (2, 9, 15)>
   - <21, (2, 10, 15)>
   - <21, (9, 10, 15)>
   - <21, (9, 23, 2)>
   - <21, (15, 10, 2)>
   - <21, (15, 10, 1)>

2. For node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - <20, (0, 8, 28)>
   - <20, (0, 8, 11)>
   - <20, (0, 14, 28)>
   - <20, (0, 14, 27)>
   - <20, (8, 11, 28)>
   - <20, (8, 14, 27)>
   - <20, (8, 20, 28)>
   - <20, (11, 14, 27)>
   - <20, (11, 22, 28)>
   - <20, (14, 27, 28)>

3. For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - <28, (1, 20, 16)>

4. For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <29, (10, 13, 24)>
   - <29, (19, 24, 25)>
   - <29, (13, 24, 26)>
   - <29, (24, 19, 25)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
