Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: 1 3-star
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [48]. Some unique 3-stars are: 
<13, (22, 1, 9)>
<4, (23, 8, 21)>
<18, (22, 3, 24)>
<20, (0, 27, 11)>
<23, (4, 8, 6)>
<0, (20, 24, 11)>
<10, (12, 15, 2)>
<24, (7, 18, 9)>
<2, (21, 10, 9)>
<28, (22, 4, 16)>
<11, (0, 20, 27)>
<9, (13, 8, 24)>
