Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (7, 8, 9, 1, 6), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (4, 0, 3, 9, 2, 5), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (4, 6, 9, 0, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (4, 1, 3, 2, 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 51 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is represented as [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<7, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<8, (4, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>
