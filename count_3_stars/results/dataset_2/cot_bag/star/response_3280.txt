Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 12) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes in the list that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors (7, 8, 3, 10). So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors (4, 13, 8). So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 7 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 6, there are 3 neighbors (16, 19, 13). So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 6 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 16, there are 4 neighbors (10, 17, 12, 6). So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 16 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 18, there are 4 neighbors (17, 15, 5, 3). So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 18 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up all these, we get a total of 14 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (4, 13, 8)>
<6, (16, 19, 13)>
<16, (10, 17, 12)>
<18, (17, 15, 5)>
