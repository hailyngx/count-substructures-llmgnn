- Node 1 has neighbors: 29
- Node 2 has neighbors: 22, 3, 16, 6
- Node 3 has neighbors: 25, 2
- Node 4 has neighbors: 25, 26
- Node 5 has neighbors: 13, 11, 16, 20
- Node 6 has neighbors: 13, 27, 0, 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 15, 23, 19
- Node 8 has neighbors: 21, 26, 18, 29, 10
- Node 9 has neighbors: 18, 10
- Node 10 has neighbors: 14, 9, 8
- Node 11 has neighbors: 5, 12, 17
- Node 12 has neighbors: 14, 11
- Node 13 has neighbors: 22, 5, 6
- Node 14 has neighbors: 0, 12, 19, 10
- Node 15 has neighbors: 7, 23, 16
- Node 16 has neighbors: 15, 5, 2
- Node 17 has neighbors: 11, 24
- Node 18 has neighbors: 9, 20, 8
- Node 19 has neighbors: 7, 14, 26
- Node 20 has neighbors: 21, 5, 18, 24
- Node 21 has neighbors: 20, 8
- Node 22 has neighbors: 13, 23, 2, 24
- Node 23 has neighbors: 22, 15, 7, 0
- Node 24 has neighbors: 17, 20, 22
- Node 25 has neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 26 has neighbors: 27, 19, 8, 4
- Node 27 has neighbors: 29, 26, 6
- Node 28 has neighbors: 0
- Node 29 has neighbors: 27, 1, 8

Analyzing the nodes, we find that only nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 22, 23, 26 have 3 or more neighbors, meaning they could form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: 3-stars = 1
- Node 2: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = 1
- Node 8: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: 3-stars = 1
- Node 14: 3-stars = 1
- Node 22: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 23: 3-stars = 1
- Node 26: 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (23, 14, 6)>, <2, (22, 3, 6)>, <5, (13, 11, 20)>, <8, (21, 26, 18)>, 
<13, (22, 5, 6)>, <14, (0, 19, 10)>, <22, (13, 23, 24)>, <23, (22, 15, 7)>, <26, (27, 19, 8)>.
