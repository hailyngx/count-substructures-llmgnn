Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (5, 0, 1), (0, 7, 14), (0, 11, 3), (0, 13, 4), (0, 5, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 1, 0), (3, 12, 7), (3, 10, 6), (3, 11, 0)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 13, 10), (4, 7, 14), (4, 6, 5), (4, 2, 5), (4, 13, 0)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 9, 8), (5, 6, 4), (5, 2, 8), (5, 8, 9), (5, 0, 9)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 10, 3), (6, 11, 4), (6, 5, 4), (6, 8, 9), (6, 4, 7)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (7, 9, 4), (7, 12, 3), (7, 0, 1), (7, 14, 4), (7, 4, 6)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 5, 9), (8, 9, 5), (8, 1, 0), (8, 6, 10)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (10, 6, 11), (10, 13, 12), (10, 11, 6), (10, 3, 12)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (11, 0, 3), (11, 10, 6), (11, 3, 1), (11, 6, 10)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 14, 7), (12, 7, 4), (12, 13, 4), (12, 3, 7)
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (13, 0, 4), (13, 10, 12), (13, 12, 14), (13, 4, 10)
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (14, 12, 7), (14, 7, 4), (14, 4, 7)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get [5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3] = [48].

So, there are 48 unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (5, 0, 1)>, <0, (0, 7, 14)>, <0, (0, 11, 3)>, <0, (0, 13, 4)>, <0, (0, 5, 9)>,
<3, (3, 1, 0)>, <3, (3, 12, 7)>, <3, (3, 10, 6)>, <3, (3, 11, 0)>,
<4, (4, 13, 10)>, <4, (4, 7, 14)>, <4, (4, 6, 5)>, <4, (4, 2, 5)>, <4, (4, 13, 0)>,
<5, (5, 9, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 4)>, <5, (5, 2, 8)>, <5, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (5, 0, 9)>,
<6, (6, 10, 3)>, <6, (6, 11, 4)>, <6, (6, 5, 4)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (6, 4, 7)>,

<11, (11, 0, 3)>, <11, (11, 10, 6)>, <11, (11, 3, 1)>, <11, (11, 6, 10)>,
<12, (12, 14, 7)>, <12, (12, 7, 4)>, <12, (12, 13, 4)>, <12, (12, 3, 7)>,
<13, (13, 0, 4)>, <13, (13, 10, 12)>, <13, (13, 12, 14)>, <13, (13, 4, 10)>,
