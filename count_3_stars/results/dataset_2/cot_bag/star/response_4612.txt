Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (8, 3) (8, 18) (13, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (9, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (0, 11) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 2) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 12, 6, 1, 18, 19, 15, 17, 2, 10, 14, 4, and 3.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula mentioned earlier.

For node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up all these, we get 1+4+4+1+1+1+1+4+4+4+4+4+4+1 = 32

So, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (0, 15, 17)>
<16, (4, 6, 19)>
<12, (7, 9, 14)>
<6, (1, 16, 17)>
<1, (6, 10, 14)>
<18, (8, 10, 19)>
<19, (16, 18, 15)>
<15, (0, 14, 19)>
<17, (6, 11, 16)>
<2, (4, 13, 5)>
<10, (1, 12, 18)>
<14, (1, 12, 15)>
<4, (2, 3, 16)>
