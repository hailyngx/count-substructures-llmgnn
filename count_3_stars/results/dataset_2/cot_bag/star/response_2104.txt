Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 1) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 10) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 16) (7, 9) (7, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 2) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 3, 15, 8, 13, 0, 1, 17, 19, 10, 16, and 6.   
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (19, 15, 3)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <3, (5, 15, 9)>, <3, (5, 15, 10)>, <3, (5, 15, 14)>, <3, (5, 15, 6)>, <3, (9, 15, 10)>, <3, (9, 15, 17)>, <3, (9, 15, 14)>, <3, (9, 15, 6)>, <3, (15, 9, 10)>, <3, (15, 9, 14)>
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <15, (5, 3, 9)>, <15, (5, 3, 10)>, <15, (5, 3, 14)>, <15, (5, 3, 6)>, <15, (9, 3, 10)>, <15, (9, 3, 17)>, <15, (9, 3, 14)>, <15, (9, 3, 6)>, <15, (3, 9, 10)>, <15, (3, 9, 14)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, (13, 19, 17)>, <8, (13, 19, 1)>, <8, (13, 19, 11)>, <8, (19, 13, 11)>
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (8, 19, 17)>, <1, (8, 19, 10)>, <1, (8, 19, 11)>, <1, (8, 17, 11)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <17, (8, 1, 3)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <19, (8, 5, 11)>, <19, (8, 5, 10)>, <19, (8, 5, 19)>, <19, (8, 11, 10)>
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <10, (9, 15, 1)>, <10, (9, 15, 19)>, <10, (9, 15, 12)>, <10, (9, 15, 10)>, <10, (15, 9, 1)>, <10, (15, 9, 19)>, <10, (15, 9, 12)>, <10, (15, 9, 10)>, <10, (1, 15, 19)>, <10, (1, 15, 12)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <16, (4, 12, 7)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 14, 11)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 15) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 17) + 4 (from node 19) + 10 (from node 10) + 1 (from node 16) + 1 (from node 6) = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
