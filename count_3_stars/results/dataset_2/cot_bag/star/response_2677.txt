Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 16) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 17) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 7) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) 

Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {14, 10, 5, 8, 1}
Node 4: Neighbors {18, 19, 6, 15, 17}
Node 12: Neighbors {18, 5, 16}
Node 13: Neighbors {14, 5}
Node 16: Neighbors {19, 12, 17}
Node 17: Neighbors {4, 8, 16, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {2, 18, 7, 9}
Node 15: Neighbors {4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: Unable to form a 3-star.
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: Unable to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (14, 10, 8)>
<0, (14, 10, 1)>
