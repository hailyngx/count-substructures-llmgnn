Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 15) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 20) (23, 8) (23, 29) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 20) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 16) (26, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 15) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 28) (10, 9) (10, 19) (4, 22) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 19) (2, 5) (2, 24) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 21) (18, 27) (18, 29) (18, 13) (27, 7) (27, 18) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 15) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 0) (1, 13) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (29, 14) (29, 23) (29, 11) (29, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 42.

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <5, (0, 2, 24)> <9, (5, 15, 25)> <14, (17, 19, 29)> <17, (15, 16, 20)> <25, (3, 14, 22)> <15, (6, 7, 11)> <24, (1, 2, 3)> <18, (13, 21, 27)> <29, (11, 18, 23)> \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [42].
