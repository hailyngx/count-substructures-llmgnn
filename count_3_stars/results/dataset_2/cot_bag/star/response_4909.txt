Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 7) (27, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 9) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 25) (20, 17) (20, 26) (21, 0) (1, 15) (1, 27) (1, 23) (1, 19) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 7) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 9) (24, 19) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 4) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 7) (19, 1) (19, 24) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) (14, 18) (14, 9) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 24) (12, 10) (16, 2) (16, 4) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 25) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 10) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 12) (10, 23) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 4+4+10+4+10+4+4+1+1+4+4+4+4+1+1+1 = 46 \)

So, there are 46 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46].
