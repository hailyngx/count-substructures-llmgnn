Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 6) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (18, 6) (13, 0) (13, 19) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 9, 7, 8, 12, 4, 5, 11, 19, 1, 14, 0, 6, and 13. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for each of these nodes.

1. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
10. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
12. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes that can form them, we get a total of 49 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].
