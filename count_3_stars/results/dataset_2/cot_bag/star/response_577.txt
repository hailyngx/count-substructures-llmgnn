Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 29) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 2) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 25) (27, 4) (27, 25) (16, 1) (16, 25) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 23) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 14) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 13) (25, 29) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 28) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 9) (5, 0) (5, 20) (23, 28) (23, 29) (3, 20) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (1, 24) (1, 16) (1, 18) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 21) (14, 29) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed around it:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (7, 20, 5) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (24, 16, 18) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (24, 26, 28, 6) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (27, 22, 29) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (2, 15, 18) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 29, 20, 14) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (21, 12, 19, 11) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (21, 14, 10) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (12, 13, 9) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (11, 15, 9) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (7, 10, 21) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (12, 13, 6) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (1, 25, 16) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (17, 1, 6) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (24, 15, 9) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (7, 0, 3, 5) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (10, 9, 14) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: 3 neighbors (4, 17, 28) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (26, 1, 19) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (26, 27, 16) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (24, 2, 25) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (22, 2, 23) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 25, 23) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of 24 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [24].
