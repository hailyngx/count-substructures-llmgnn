Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 17) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 13) (0, 11) (0, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, Node 16 has 4 neighbors, and Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Therefore, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:

\[ {}[{20 \choose 3} + {20 \choose 3} + {3 \choose 3}] = [1140 + 1140 + 1] = 2281. \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:
<11, (16, 0, 13)>
<16, (11, 0, 7)>
<4, (8, 19, 14)>
<4, (19, 3, 14)>
