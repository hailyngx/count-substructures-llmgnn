Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 6, 15)
- Node 1: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 2, 3, 25)
- Node 2: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 1, 12, 29)
- Node 3: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 1, 13, 15, 25) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 16, 20, 28)
- Node 6: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 0, 9, 21) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 8, 10, 23)
- Node 8: Degree = 5 (neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 15, 23) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 6, 13, 19, 22) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 10: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 7, 11)
- Node 11: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 7, 8, 10, 21) -> Forms 1 3-star

- Node 13: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 3, 9, 12, 28) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 14: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 18, 22)
- Node 15: Degree = 5 (neighbors: 3, 8, 15, 24, 25) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 16: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 4, 17)
- Node 17: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 16, 23, 26)
- Node 18: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 14, 24, 26)
- Node 19: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 9, 29)
- Node 20: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 4, 21)
- Node 21: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 6, 11, 20, 22) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 22: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 9, 14, 21, 25) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 23: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 7, 8, 17, 28) -> Forms 1 3-star

- Node 25: Degree = 4 (neighbors: 1, 15, 22, 24) -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 26: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 17, 18, 27)
- Node 27: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 12, 26)
- Node 28: Degree = 3 (neighbors: 4, 13, 23)
- Node 29: Degree = 2 (neighbors: 2, 19)

There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, forming a total of 7 * inom{8}{3} = 56 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56]. The unique 3-stars are:
<3, 1, 13, 25>
<6, 0, 9, 21>
<8, 7, 11, 23>
<9, 6, 13, 22>
<11, 7, 21, 8>
<12, 2, 13, 8>
<13, 3, 12, 28>
<15, 3, 8, 25>
<21, 11, 6, 22>
<22, 9, 25, 14>
<23, 7, 8, 28>
