Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to inspect each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's start by identifying these nodes and calculating the number of 3-stars associated with each:

1. Node 0: Has 5 neighbors (9, 3, 8, 11, 2). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   
2. Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (7, 3, 6, 12). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
3. Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (6, 14, 0). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 2 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   
4. Node 3: Has 5 neighbors (5, 1, 11, 0, 6). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 3 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   
5. Node 4: Has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 10). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
6. Node 5: Has 5 neighbors (9, 13, 4, 3, 10). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   
7. Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 13, 2). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
8. Node 8: Has 4 neighbors (9, 4, 10, 0). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
9. Node 11: Has 4 neighbors (3, 14, 0, 13). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 11 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
10. Node 12: Has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 13). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 12 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   
11. Node 13: Has 4 neighbors (5, 12, 11, 6). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 13 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   
12. Node 14: Has 3 neighbors (11, 2, 10). Therefore, the number of 3-stars associated with node 14 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node: 
\[10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 47\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 47. Represented as [47].
