Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 6 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 6 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 6 3-stars
- Node 8: 6 3-stars
- Node 9: 6 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 6 3-stars
- Node 12: 6 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 12, 0)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <1, (6, 11, 1)>, <1, (8, 4, 1)>, <1, (7, 6, 1)>, <1, (7, 12, 1)>, <2, (8, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 12, 3)>, <4, (11, 4, 8)>, <4, (8, 13, 4)>, <4, (5, 4, 11)>, <4, (5, 4, 2)>, <4, (11, 12, 4)>, <4, (8, 2, 4)>, <6, (10, 5, 11)>, <6, (1, 11, 6)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <6, (9, 14, 6)>, <7, (13, 7, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (12, 7, 0)>, <8, (13, 8, 4)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 11, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (9, 3, 12)>, <9, (9, 6, 14)>, <10, (5, 10, 11)>, <11, (12, 0, 3)>, <11, (1, 7, 6)>, <11, (1, 8, 4)>, <11, (4, 5, 11)>, <12, (9, 6, 14)>, <12, (3, 0, 12)>, <12, (11, 4, 8)>, <12, (7, 6, 1)>, <12, (7, 12, 0)>, <13, (0, 6, 13)>, <14, (13, 7, 2)>, <14, (13, 8, 4)>, <14, (2, 8, 14)>, <14, (9, 6, 14)>
