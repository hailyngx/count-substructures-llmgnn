Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 6, 7, 12, and 2. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 6:
There are 5 neighbors of node 6: 7, 10, 3, 11, 13.
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 3-stars around node 6.

2. Node 7:
There are 4 neighbors of node 7: 6, 12, 2, 1.
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars around node 7.

3. Node 12:
There are 4 neighbors of node 12: 7, 2, 3, 8.
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars around node 12.

4. Node 2:
There are 5 neighbors of node 2: 7, 12, 5, 13, 11.
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 3-stars around node 2.

In total, there are 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (7, 10, 3)>
<6, (11, 10, 3)>
<6, (13, 10, 3)>
<7, (6, 12, 2)>
<12, (7, 2, 8)>
<2, (7, 12, 5)>
<2, (13, 12, 11)>
<2, (5, 12, 11)>
<2, (13, 7, 11)>
<2, (5, 7, 11)>
