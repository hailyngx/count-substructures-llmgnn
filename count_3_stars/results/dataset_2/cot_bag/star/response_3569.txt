Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 15) (12, 21) (12, 29) (12, 6) (27, 28) (27, 17) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 5) (18, 20) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 26) (21, 12) (21, 20) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 22) (1, 29) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 20) (7, 15) (25, 19) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 29) (20, 22) (29, 12) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 16) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 16) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 20) (9, 28) (9, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph include:
<0, 6, 24>, <2, 14, 26>, <4, 13, 3>, <5, 16, 19>, <4, 13, 3>, <5, 16, 19>, <15, 7, 15>, <17, 27, 28>, <20, 21, 28>, <20, 21, 29>, <20, 26, 23>
