Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 60 edges provided in the graph.
We can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 8, 11
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14, 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 10, 11, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 2, 4, 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 11
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 13
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, 14, 1, 7
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 13, 14
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 12, 2, 6
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 6, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 7, 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 12, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 4)>
Node 9 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 11)> included in this set
Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (1, 14, 6)>
Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (9, 1, 10)>

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 23 3-stars.
