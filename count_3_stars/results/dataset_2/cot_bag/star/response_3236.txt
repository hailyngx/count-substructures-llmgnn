Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 22) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 28) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 21) (27, 11) (27, 26) (27, 19) (8, 9) (20, 0) (20, 11) (20, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 19) (6, 28) (6, 4) (28, 1) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 26) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 20) (11, 29) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 5) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 9) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 5) (25, 26) (21, 12) (21, 19) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 23) (10, 12) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 29) (29, 14) (29, 0) (29, 11) (29, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3}\n = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 5, 16)>, <4, (0, 6, 22)>, <5, (4, 13, 16)>, <10, (7, 20, 29)>, <11, (14, 20, 29)>, <14, (11, 17, 29)>, <19, (7, 18, 21)>, <20, (0, 10, 11)>, <22, (4, 14, 17)>, <23, (15, 24, 28)>, <25, (1, 2, 26)>, <28, (1, 6, 26)>, <29, (0, 10, 11)>.
