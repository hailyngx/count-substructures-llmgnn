Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 1: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 2: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 3: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 4: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 6: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 7: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 8: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 9: can form 4 3-stars
- Node 10: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 11: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 12: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 13: can form 3 3-stars
- Node 14: can form 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [50]

Unique 3-stars found:

<1, (4, 14, 13)>
<4, (5, 0, 12)>
<5, (7, 0, 14)>
<9, (8, 4, 12)>
<10, (6, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 3, 7)>
<14, (8, 5, 4)>
<0, (5, 14, 2)>
<3, (8, 13, 10)>
<7, (5, 0, 13)>
<8, (9, 14, 1)>
