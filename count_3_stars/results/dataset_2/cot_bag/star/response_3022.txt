Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (2, 16) (2, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (8, 2) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 13) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 6) (19, 18) (19, 3) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 15) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 15, 13)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (4, 17, 14, 13)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (4, 19, 10)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (7, 10, 1, 3)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (9, 15, 0)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (7, 13, 12)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 18, 17, 14)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (4, 12, 3)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (16, 10, 6)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (1, 17, 0, 6)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (1, 9, 15)
- Node 15: 3 neighbors (5, 0, 14)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (7, 12, 18, 2)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (11, 9, 1, 13)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (16, 9, 19)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (18, 3)

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node with 3 or more neighbors:

\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 32.

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we have [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 15, 13)>, <1, (4, 9, 14)>, <3, (4, 10, 19)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 17, 14)>, <13, (1, 17, 6)>, <16, (7, 12, 18)>, <17, (9, 1, 13)>.
