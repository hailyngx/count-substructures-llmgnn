Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 12, 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 10, 1 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 11, 13, 1, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 0 (4 neighbors)
- Node 13 has neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 2, 11, 0 (6 neighbors)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 5, 4, 10, 6, 11 (5 neighbors)
- Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 13, 12, 14, 2 (5 neighbors)
- Node 14 has neighbors: 4, 3, 8, 11, 6 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 13, 11, 10 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 12, 14, 0 (3 neighbors)
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 12, 2 (3 neighbors)
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 13, 6 (3 neighbors)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the counts, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 66 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 12, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 10)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <13, (4, 7, 8)>, <12, (5, 4, 10)>, <11, (7, 13, 12)>, <14, (4, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 13, 11)>, <6, (12, 14, 0)>, <10, (9, 12, 2)>, <0, (1, 13, 6)>.
