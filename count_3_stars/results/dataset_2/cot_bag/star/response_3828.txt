Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
