Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 21) (2, 4) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 10) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (22, 0) (26, 5) (26, 3) (24, 12) (24, 15) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 24) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 20) (1, 9) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 11) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 18) (25, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 20) (16, 8) (16, 14) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (17, 19, 22, 11)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (13, 14, 20, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (8, 26, 6, 14)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (2, 8, 23)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (11, 12, 26)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (3, 7, 12)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (3, 4, 16)
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (13, 17, 29)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (0, 5, 13, 20)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 24, 27)
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (1, 10, 11)
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 21)
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (0, 7, 10, 18)
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (7, 17, 28)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (0, 25, 29)
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: (1, 9, 11)
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: (2, 14, 23, 27)
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: (4, 21, 28)
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: (12, 20, 21, 29, 9)
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: (10, 19, 27, 29)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 11 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 17 forms 4 3-stars

Adding up these totals gives us a total of 20 3-stars. So, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 19, 11)>
<1, (13, 14, 20)>
<3, (8, 6, 14)>
<11, (13, 0, 20)>
<17, (10, 18, 7)>
