Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to determine which nodes are its neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 1: <9, (6, 7, 1)>

Adding these unique 3-stars together, we get a total of [5].
