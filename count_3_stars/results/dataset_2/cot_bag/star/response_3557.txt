Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 22) (7, 4) (7, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 25) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 10) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 2) (25, 18) (25, 0) (25, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 29) (19, 22) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 21) (15, 5) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 24) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 8) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 3) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 28) (24, 16) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 23) (2, 27) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 1) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 5) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 13, 28, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 13:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 13 as the center. 
Thus, <13, (10, 27, 29)>, <13, (10, 27, 27)>, <13, (10, 29, 27)>, and <13, (10, 29, 29)>.

For node 28:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 28 as the center. 
Thus, <28, (1, 8, 12)>, <28, (1, 8, 16)>, <28, (1, 8, 24)>, <28, (1, 8, 28)>, <28, (1, 12, 16)>, <28, (1, 12, 24)>, <28, (1, 12, 28)>, <28, (1, 16, 24)>, <28, (1, 16, 28)>, and <28, (1, 24, 28)>.

For node 12:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars with node 12 as the center. 
Thus, <12, (1, 13, 28)>, <12, (1, 13, 7)>, <12, (1, 13, 8)>, <12, (1, 28, 7)>, <12, (1, 28, 8)>, <12, (13, 7, 8)>, <12, (13, 13, 7)>, <12, (13, 13, 8)>, <12, (7, 13, 8)>, and <12, (7, 7, 8)>.

Adding the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 10 = 24\), so the final answer is [24].
