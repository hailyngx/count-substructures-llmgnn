Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 100 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 100, which we will represent as [100].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 13)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 13, 4)>
- <0, (5, 6, 10)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 14)>
- <2, (5, 7, 14)>
- <3, (1, 0, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 13, 4)>
- <3, (2, 7, 14)>
- <4, (0, 13, 3)>
- <5, (1, 0, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 10)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 9, 14)>
- <7, (2, 5, 14)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
