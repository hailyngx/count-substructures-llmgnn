Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 11) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \)

Total 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \)

Total 3-stars = 96

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [96].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 11)>
<4, (2, 11, 14)>
<7, (6, 10, 13)>
<8, (0, 6, 14)>
<13, (2, 10, 12)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (8, 10, 12)>
<14, (4, 5, 8)>
<10, (0, 3, 7)>
