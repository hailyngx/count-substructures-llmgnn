Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 19) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (3, 18) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 9, 16>
<2, 6, 13>
<6, 2, 18>
<7, 8, 12>
<8, 7, 13>
<9, 1, 15>
<10, 17, 11>
<11, 17, 18>
<12, 15, 17>
<13, 6, 4>
<14, 5, 0>
<16, 9, 1>
<17, 10, 12>
<18, 2, 11>
