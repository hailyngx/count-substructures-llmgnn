Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 11, 15, 4, 7, 14, 17, 8, 13, 10, 5, 19, 2, 12, 0, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 11: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 4, 7, 14, 17, 8, 13, 10, 5, 19, 2, 12, 0, and 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is given by \( 1 + 4 + 10 \times 12 = 121 \). So, we have a total of 121 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [121]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <11, (16, 4, 18)>, <15, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (11, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 10, 8)>, <14, (15, 17, 9)>, <17, (14, 19, 8)>, <8, (7, 17, 13)>, <13, (16, 12, 0)>, <10, (7, 0, 9)>, <5, (15, 19, 6)>, <19, (17, 8, 5)>, <2, (17, 12, 18)>, <12, (13, 2, 18)>, <0, (15, 13, 10)>, and <9, (16, 7, 14)>.
