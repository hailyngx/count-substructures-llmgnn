Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (7, 15) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which we will analyze to find the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 1: Degree = 4
2. Node 2: Degree = 4
3. Node 3: Degree = 4
4. Node 4: Degree = 4
5. Node 5: Degree = 5
6. Node 6: Degree = 2
7. Node 9: Degree = 4
8. Node 11: Degree = 4
9. Node 12: Degree = 3
10. Node 13: Degree = 4
11. Node 14: Degree = 3
12. Node 15: Degree = 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these counts, we find a total of \( 4+4+4+4+10+4+4+1+1+4+1 = 35 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 18)>, <1, (3, 5, 16)>, <1, (3, 13, 5)>, <1, (3, 13, 18)>, <1, (5, 16, 2)>, 
<1, (8, 18, 5)>, <1, (8, 18, 13)>, <2, (1, 3, 16)>, <2, (1, 9, 11)>, <2, (3, 1, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 13)>, 
<2, (9, 11, 14)>, <2, (9, 11, 19)>, <2, (11, 19, 1)>, <3, (1, 5, 16)>, <3, (1, 5, 18)>, <3, (2, 1, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 13)>, <3, (5, 13, 18)>, <4, (2, 3, 15)>, <4, (3, 5, 13)>, <4, (5, 13, 18)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 16)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, 
<11, (2, 9, 19)>, <13, (3, 5, 18)>, <13, (5, 15, 10)>, <14, (9, 11, 19)>, <15, (3, 13, 5)>, <15, (4, 13, 18)>.
