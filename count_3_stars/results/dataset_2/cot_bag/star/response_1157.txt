Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (5, 0), (12, 0), (6, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (7, 1), (2, 1), (0, 1), (1, 13), (1, 8). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 14), (2, 11). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (12, 3), (6, 3), (0, 3), (3, 10), (3, 8), (3, 4). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (5, 4), (3, 4), (4, 13), (4, 10). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 5 has 6 neighbors: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 14). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (8, 6). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 1). Number of 3-stars: 1
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 1), (8, 10). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (2, 10), (3, 10), (10, 8), (10, 4). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (5, 11), (7, 11), (12, 11), (2, 11). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 11), (12, 3). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (5, 14), (7, 14), (12, 14), (14, 2). Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-star configurations: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [95] \]

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 10)>
<2, (11, 12, 14)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 10, 13)>
<5, (0, 6, 11)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (11, 12, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 10)>
<10, (1, 3, 4)>
<11, (2, 5, 12)>
<12, (2, 7, 14)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>
