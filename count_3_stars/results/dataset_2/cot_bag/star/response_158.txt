Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (11, 10) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 10) (28, 8) (28, 5) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 2) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 18) (5, 21) (5, 28) (5, 29) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 9) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 16) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 14) (8, 25) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 20) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 18) (2, 24) (2, 1) (20, 12) (20, 27) (25, 1) (25, 8) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 3) (27, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 16) (18, 21) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 27) (15, 16) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 27) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 29 3-stars. So, the final count is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 13, 24)>, <1, (12, 16, 25)>, <1, (12, 16, 29)>, <1, (16, 25, 29)>, <1, (9, 23, 27)>, <3, (6, 27, 29)>, <4, (16, 23, 29)>, <7, (0, 10, 19)>, <7, (0, 10, 28)>, <7, (10, 17, 19)>, <7, (17, 18, 21)>, <8, (14, 18, 25)>, <8, (26, 28, 10)>, <8, (26, 28, 8)>, <8, (26, 28, 5)>, <9, (1, 23, 27)>, <12, (1, 16, 20)>, <16, (4, 12, 15)>, <16, (4, 12, 20)>, <16, (15, 20, 12)>, <17, (7, 18, 21)>, <17, (1, 18, 21)>, <17, (1, 18, 14)>, <17, (1, 18, 6)>, <18, (7, 17, 1)>, <18, (7, 17, 21)>, <18, (7, 17, 14)>, <18, (7, 17, 6)>, <18, (10, 28, 5)>.
