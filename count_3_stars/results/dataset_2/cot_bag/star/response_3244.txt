This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 12) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 19) (18, 9) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 24) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 24) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 27) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 21) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 24) (9, 18) (9, 22) (9, 27) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 28) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 10) (28, 23) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 21) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 21) (0, 29) (13, 14) (13, 20) (13, 21) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 13) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 29) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 19) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 0) (29, 23) (7, 14) (7, 23) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 4) (10, 16) (10, 25) (10, 28) (10, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (11, 3, 4)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (26, 12)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (11, 8, 21)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (28, 0, 19)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 10)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (17, 12, 21)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (11, 16, 4)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (14, 23)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (24, 2)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (18, 22, 27)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (16, 25, 28, 19)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 2)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (1, 15, 5, 19)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (14, 20, 21)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (17, 7, 13)
- Node 15: 1 neighbor (12)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (10, 6)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (14, 5, 21)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (9, 29)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (3, 10, 12)
- Node 20: 3 neighbors (26, 13, 27)
- Node 21: 5 neighbors (17, 2, 5, 0, 13)
- Node 22: 2 neighbors (9, 24)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (28, 7, 29)
- Node 24: 5 neighbors (22, 8, 26, 27, 28)
- Node 25: 2 neighbors (10, 29)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (1, 20, 24)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (20, 9, 24)
- Node 28: 4 neighbors (3, 10, 24, 23)
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (18, 25, 0, 23)

Now, letâ€™s calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: 2 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 4 3-stars
- Node 28: 2 3-stars
- Node 29: 2 3-stars

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of [12] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 6, 10)>, <10, (16, 25, 28)>, <12, (1, 15, 19)>, <21, (2, 5, 13)>, <24, (22, 26, 27)>, <24, (8, 26, 27)>, <24, (8, 24, 28)>, <24, (24, 28, 23)>, <28, (3, 10, 24)>, <28, (10, 24, 23)>, <29, (25, 0, 23)>, <29, (25, 0, 23)>.
