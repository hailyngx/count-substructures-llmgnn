Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes in the graph, and each of them has the following number of neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 2 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (9, 13, 19)>
<4, (6, 14, 17)>
<13, (1, 4, 19)>
<14, (6, 10, 4)>
<17, (5, 16, 19)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
