Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 5, node 9, and node 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors of node 5: nodes 9, 6, 2, and 10. Hence, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars associated with node 5.

For node 9:
There are 5 neighbors of node 9: nodes 5, 8, 11, 1, and 12. Hence, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars associated with node 9.

For node 2:
There are 6 neighbors of node 2: nodes 5, 7, 10, 6, 14, and 13. Hence, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars associated with node 2.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 20 = 34.

So, the final count of unique 3-stars is [34]. 

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 11)>
<2, (5, 7, 10)>
