Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (9, 6, 7)
- 1: (5, 9, 6, 4)
- 2: (4, 7, 8, 3)
- 3: (5, 4, 7, 2)
- 4: (5, 9, 3, 1, 2)
- 5: (9, 1, 4, 3)
- 6: (9, 1, 0)
- 7: (9, 0, 3, 2, 8)
- 8: (7, 2)
- 9: (5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 0)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the formula mentioned earlier. We'll ignore nodes with less than 3 neighbors:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 4, 9)>
- <4, (5, 1, 9)>
- <7, (9, 0, 1)>
- <9, (5, 4, 7)>
