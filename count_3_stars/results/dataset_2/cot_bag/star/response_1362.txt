Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each such node. Let's go through the process:

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 8, 11, 4, 10}. Applying \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) to node 5 gives us 10 3-stars. 
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 2, 14, 13}. Applying \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) to node 9 gives us 4 3-stars. 
3. Node 14 has 6 neighbors: {9, 4, 11, 6, 13, 10}. Applying \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) to node 14 gives us 20 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 20] = [34] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<5, (9, 8, 11)>  
<9, (5, 2, 14)>  
<14, (9, 4, 11)>  
<14, (9, 6, 13)>  
<14, (4, 11, 6)>
