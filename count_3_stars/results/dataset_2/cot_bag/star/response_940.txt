Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 10) (2, 6) (2, 17) (10, 0) (10, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 1) (5, 3) (5, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {14, 10, 13}
- 1: {9, 11, 16, 18, 19}
- 2: {6, 17}
- 3: {15, 5, 12}
- 4: {11, 19}
- 5: {3, 18}
- 6: {2}
- 7: {12, 11}
- 8: {3, 15, 13}
- 9: {18, 1, 13}
- 10: {0, 16}
- 11: {7, 1, 4}
- 12: {3, 17, 7, 19}
- 13: {15, 8, 9, 0}
- 14: {18, 0, 16}
- 15: {3, 8, 13}
- 16: {14, 10, 18, 1}
- 17: {12, 2}
- 18: {9, 1, 14, 16, 5}
- 19: {12, 1, 4}

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 37 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [37]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 16, 18)>
<3, (8, 13, 15)>
<8, (3, 13, 15)>
<9, (1, 13, 19)>
<12, (7, 19, 13)>
<13, (8, 9, 15)>
<14, (0, 16, 18)>
<16, (1, 14, 18)>
<18, (1, 9, 16)>
