Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 10) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 17) (11, 3) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 14, 15, 1
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<0, (14, 15, 1)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 13, 0
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as center: inom{4}{3} = 4
<1, (9, 6, 0)>, <1, (9, 13, 0)>, <1, (6, 13, 0)>, <1, (9, 6, 13)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 14, 5, 6
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<2, (14, 5, 6)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 18, 10
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<4, (5, 18, 10)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 4, 8
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as center: inom{5}{3} = 10
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 4, 8)>, <5, (6, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 1, 2, 19, 8
Number of 3-stars with node 6 as center: inom{5}{3} = 10
<6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 19)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 19)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 19, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 19)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 19, 8)>, <6, (2, 19, 8)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 18, 1
Number of 3-stars with node 9 as center: inom{4}{3} = 4
<9, (3, 5, 18)>, <9, (3, 5, 1)>, <9, (3, 18, 1)>, <9, (5, 18, 1)>

Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 13, 16
Number of 3-stars with node 10 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<10, (4, 13, 16)>

Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 17, 1, 10
Number of 3-stars with node 13 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<13, (17, 1, 10)>

Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 17, 0, 19, 2
Number of 3-stars with node 14 as center: inom{4}{3} = 4
<14, (17, 0, 19)>, <14, (17, 0, 2)>, <14, (17, 19, 2)>, <14, (0, 19, 2)>

Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 19, 0
Node 15 cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 17, 10, 8
Number of 3-stars with node 16 as center: inom{3}{3} = 1
<16, (17, 10, 8)>

Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 16, 12
Number of 3-stars with node 17 as center: inom{4}{3} = 4
<17, (14, 13, 16)>, <17, (14, 13, 12)>, <17, (14, 16, 12)>, <17, (13, 16, 12)>

Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 9, 4
Node 18 cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 15, 14, 6, 11
Number of 3-stars with node 19 as center: inom{4}{3} = 4
<19, (15, 14, 6)>, <19, (15, 14, 11)>, <19, (15, 6, 11)>, <19, (14, 6, 11)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 40. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 40.
