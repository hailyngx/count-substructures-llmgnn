Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 53 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 9, 2)>
- <0, (5, 7, 2)>
- <2, (7, 0, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 0)>
- <5, (7, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 1, 0)>
- <9, (4, 7, 3)>
