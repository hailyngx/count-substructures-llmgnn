Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent this graph visually with its connections:

```

        1 -- 3 -- 9 -- 2
        |    | \  |    |
        4 -- 0    8    6
        |
        7 -- 5

```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 28

Thus, the final answer is [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
