Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 4, 7, 8, 6, 5, 13, 3, 12, 1, 9, 0, 2, and 14. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, there are 72 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (8, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (12, 0, 7)>, <6, (11, 4, 5)>, <5, (13, 14, 0)>, <13, (5, 1, 14)>, <3, (0, 5, 12)>, <12, (9, 14, 3)>, <1, (7, 13, 11)>, <9, (7, 1, 12)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 14)>, <14, (12, 13, 2)>
