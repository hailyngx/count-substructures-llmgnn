Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (5, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (11, 1) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 16) (14, 3) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 15) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are few nodes that have more than three neighbors: 
Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 4, 15, 18.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 11, 10, 19.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 19, 14, 16.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 15, 17.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 18, 0.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 19, 5.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 17, 16, 19.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 18, 7, 19.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 18, 4, 0.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors: 9, 17, 3, 10.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 9, 18, 4, 16.
Node 18 has 6 neighbors: 6, 2, 15, 17, 13.
Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 1, 3, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than three neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 82\).

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 15)>
<0, (2, 18, 6)>
<0, (4, 15, 18)>
<0, (6, 15, 18)>
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
<3, (14, 16, 19)>
<4, (0, 15, 18)>
<4, (15, 17, 18)>
<8, (5, 8, 19)>
<9, (6, 18, 19)>
<9, (16, 17, 19)>
<9, (16, 17, 18)>
<9, (17, 18, 19)>
<9, (17, 18, 6)>
<13, (7, 18, 19)>
<16, (9, 10, 17)>
<16, (9, 10, 16)>
<17, (16, 9, 19)>
<18, (13, 18, 19)>
<19, (1, 13, 19)>
