Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 8) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 3) (19, 16) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 15) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 15, 16, and 18.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<2, (5, 9, 12)>  
<3, (1, 8, 19)>  
<4, (7, 13, 14)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<7, (4, 5, 15)>  
<12, (2, 6, 16)>  
<15, (0, 2, 18)>  
<16, (4, 10, 19)>  
<18, (5, 7, 17)>
