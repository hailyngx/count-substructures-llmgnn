Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 6, 4, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 7, 3, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {9, 4, 7, 1, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {7, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 4, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 7}

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so we don't need to calculate further. Now, summing up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 \) 3-stars in total. 
\[ [36] \]
The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 4, 8)>
- <0, (6, 4, 8)>
