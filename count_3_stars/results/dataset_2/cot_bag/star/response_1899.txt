Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:  0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
