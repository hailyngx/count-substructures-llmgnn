Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars found in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
