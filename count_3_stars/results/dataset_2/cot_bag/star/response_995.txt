Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 14) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 18) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 8) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 13) (28, 10) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 21) (21, 28) (21, 17) (9, 22) (9, 10) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 25) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 24) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 14) (14, 29) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 25) (19, 2) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 18) (25, 11) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 16) (11, 25) (11, 24) (11, 4) (24, 20) (24, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 26) (7, 27) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 10) (6, 14) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (4, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (5, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars found for each node, we get a total of 59 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
