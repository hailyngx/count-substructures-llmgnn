Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 76 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 12, 14)>, <0, (2, 12, 14)>, <0, (2, 10, 12)>, <0, (2, 8, 12)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 11)>, 
<5, (9, 12, 13)>, 
<7, (4, 11, 14)>, <7, (8, 12, 14)>, 
<12, (5, 7, 14)>, 
<13, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<14, (0, 7, 12)>.
