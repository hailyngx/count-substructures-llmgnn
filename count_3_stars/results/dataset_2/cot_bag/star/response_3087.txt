Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 14. Let's first calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node gives us a total of 115 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [115].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 14)>, <2, (5, 12, 14)>, <5, (9, 13, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 10)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <12, (3, 7, 14)>, <14, (6, 3, 12)>.
