Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (12, 0) (9, 18) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 15) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: node 1, node 3, and node 6. Let's determine the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 15, 18)>
- <6, (11, 5, 17)>
