Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's find the 3-stars:
Node 10 has 5 neighbors.
Node 11 has 5 neighbors.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 78 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<10, (11, 0, 14)>
<11, (10, 1, 0)>
<12, (10, 8, 13)>
<13, (7, 5, 1)>
<1, (11, 6, 2)>
<0, (10, 11, 3)>
<3, (7, 5, 0)>
<14, (4, 10, 3)>
