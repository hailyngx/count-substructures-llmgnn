Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 2, 12, 8}
- Node 4: {12, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 3, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 13, 2, 14, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 7, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 11, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {11, 8, 13}

Based on this information, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>, <3, (12, 6, 4)>, <3, (12, 6, 10)>
- Node 6 forms three 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 3, 12)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (9, 1, 10)>
- Node 8 forms four 3-stars: <8, (3, 10, 13)>, <8, (3, 2, 6)>, <8, (3, 2, 14)>, <8, (8, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 4] = 13.
