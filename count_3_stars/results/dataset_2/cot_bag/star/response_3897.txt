Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors [11, 13, 6, 12]
- Node 1: Neighbors [6, 2, 5]
- Node 2: Neighbors [13, 1, 12, 5, 14]
- Node 3: Neighbors [11, 6, 9, 5]
- Node 4: Neighbors [9, 10, 5]
- Node 5: Neighbors [4, 3, 1, 2, 12, 14]
- Node 6: Neighbors [8, 3, 1, 0]
- Node 7: Neighbors [11, 14, 9]
- Node 8: Neighbors [11, 13, 9, 6]
- Node 9: Neighbors [4, 7, 8, 3, 14]
- Node 10: Neighbors [4, 11]
- Node 11: Neighbors [7, 10, 3, 0, 8]
- Node 12: Neighbors [2, 5, 14, 0]
- Node 13: Neighbors [8, 2, 0]
- Node 14: Neighbors [7, 9, 2, 12, 5]

Based on the information given, we can identify the 3-star formations:

- Node 4: [9, 5, 10]
- Node 7: [9, 14, 11]
- Node 9: [4, 7, 8], [3, 5, 9], [9, 14, 7]
- Node 11: [10, 4, 11], [3, 9, 11], [11, 7, 8], [11, 0, 13]
- Node 14: [2, 12, 14], [5, 12, 14], [14, 7, 9], [14, 2, 5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4] = 17. 
So, the unique 3-stars found are <4, 9, 10>, <7, 9, 14>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 14>, <11, 0, 13>, <10, 4, 11>, <3, 9, 11>, <11, 7, 8>, <2, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 14>, <14, 7, 9, <14, 2, 5>.
