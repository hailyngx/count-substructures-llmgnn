Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 21) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 1) (27, 12) (5, 6) (5, 26) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 24) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 11) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 7) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 20) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 23) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 16) (25, 19) (25, 29) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 26) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 23) (20, 9) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 7) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors

For each of these nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes, we get a total of 75 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<13, (22, 28, 9)>, <22, (13, 2, 4)>, <1, (14, 24, 27)>, <6, (21, 5, 2)>, <10, (11, 0, 9)>, <9, (13, 10, 8)>, <0, (10, 14, 16)>, <14, (1, 0, 24)>, <29, (17, 25, 18)>, <28, (13, 3, 7)>, <15, (7, 18, 4)>, <17, (11, 29, 8)>, <16, (13, 0, 18)>, <3, (6, 28, 23)>, <18, (29, 15, 16)>, <25, (19, 29, 24)>, <26, (5, 2, 6)>, <2, (22, 6, 26)>, <4, (22, 6, 15)>, <7, (10, 28, 15)>, <23, (13, 1, 7)>.
