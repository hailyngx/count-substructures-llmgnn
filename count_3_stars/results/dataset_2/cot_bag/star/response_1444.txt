Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 118 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [118], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 12)>, <5, (12, 14, 0)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <12, (4, 5, 10)>, <13, (1, 2, 11)>, <14, (4, 5, 6)>.
