Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Add up all the 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 65 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65]. 

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 12)>, 
<3, (0, 10, 11)>, 
<4, (8, 11, 13)>, 
<5, (9, 10, 14)>, 
<6, (0, 7, 11)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 13)>, 
<8, (4, 10, 11)>, 
<9, (5, 12, 14)>, 
<10, (0, 13, 5)>, 
<11, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<12, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<13, (4, 7, 12)>, 
<14, (2, 5, 6)>.
