Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 5) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with the most neighbors are nodes 3, 10, 14, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

So the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \).  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<3, (6, 5, 15)>  
<10, (2, 8, 3)>  
<10, (2, 12, 4)>  
<10, (2, 12, 5)>  
<10, (8, 14, 3)>  
<10, (8, 14, 0)>  
<14, (1, 18, 13)>  
<14, (1, 13, 19)>  
<14, (8, 10, 3)>  
<14, (8, 18, 1)>  
<17, (5, 6, 3)>  
<17, (5, 19, 13)>  
<17, (14, 3, 0)>
