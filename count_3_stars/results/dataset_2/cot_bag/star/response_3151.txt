Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 11, 4, 10, 12, 2, 14, 5, and 13. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \(10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 80 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <6, (1, 7, 11)>
- <6, (9, 11, 12)>
- <9, (2, 3, 11)>
- <11, (6, 10, 12)>
- <11, (8, 10, 12)>
- <4, (8, 10, 14)>
- <4, (5, 13, 14)>
- <10, (7, 11, 12)>
- <12, (5, 7, 13)>
- <2, (1, 5, 14)>
- <14, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (2, 12, 14)>
- <13, (3, 4, 12)>
