Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with degrees greater than or equal to 3 are 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 11, 0, 10, 2, 9, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 9, and 5. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 12, 2, 5, and 1. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 3, 6, and 0. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 13, and 12. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 6, 8, and 10. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 0. Hence, there is only 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 7, 3, 2, 11, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the center.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 12, 14, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 10. Hence, there is only 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 5, 0, 8, 13, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 12, 9, and 13. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 4, 11, 10, 2, and 13. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 2, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives:
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [68] \]

Hence, there are 68 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
