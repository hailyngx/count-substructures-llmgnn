Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 6 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: [\({6 \choose 3} = 20\)]
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: [\({3 \choose 3} = 1\)]
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 7: [\({4 \choose 3} = 4\)]
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 9: [\({3 \choose 3} = 1\)]
- Node 11: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 13: [\({3 \choose 3} = 1\)]
- Node 14: No 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 10: [\({4 \choose 3} = 4\)]
- Node 12: [\({6 \choose 3} = 20\)]

Adding them up: 
\[ 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 51 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 13)>, 
<0, (7, 12, 14)>, <0, (7, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 12, 2)>, <0, (7, 12, 6)>,
<3, (0, 2, 12)>,
<7, (0, 10, 12)>, <7, (0, 12, 6)>,
<9, (10, 11, 13)>
