Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 1) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 11) (16, 20) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 22) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 2) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 23) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 3) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 6) (0, 2) (0, 15) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 8) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 25) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 4) (19, 14) (19, 28) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 29) (29, 21) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 5) (20, 16) (20, 10) (25, 13) (25, 23) (24, 27) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 20) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 4) (6, 22) (6, 27) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 29) (4, 15) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can analyze each node's degree to determine the total number of 3-stars.

Let's identify the nodes with their corresponding degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 1
- Node 25: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with degree greater than or equal to 3:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (22, 5, 3)>
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (9, 0, 7)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (1, 27, 26)>
- Node 5: 2 3-stars <5, (11, 4, 28)> and <5, (1, 22, 29)>
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (17, 2, 29)>
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star <11, (16, 8, 5)>
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star <13, (22, 16, 25)>
- Node 16: 1 3-star <16, (11, 20, 13)>
- Node 18: 1 3-star <18, (17, 7, 8)>
- Node 22: 1 3-star <22, (13, 6, 12)>
- Node 26: 1 3-star <26, (3, 28, 23)>
- Node 27: 1 3-star <27, (3, 21, 24)>
- Node 28: 1 3-star <28, (26, 5, 10)>
- Node 29: 1 3-star <29, (21, 15, 7)>

Adding up all these, we have a total of 12 3-stars, which can be represented as:
\[ [12] \] 
\[ <1, (22, 5, 3)>, <2, (9, 0, 7)>, <3, (1, 27, 26)>, <5, (11, 4, 28)>, <5, (1, 22, 29)>, <7, (17, 2, 29)>, <11, (16, 8, 5)>, <13, (22, 16, 25)>, <16, (11, 20, 13)>, <18, (17, 7, 8)>, <22, (13, 6, 12)>, <26, (3, 28, 23)>, <27, (3, 21, 24)>, <28, (26, 5, 10)>, <29, (21, 15, 7)> \]
