Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 5, 2, 0, 14, 3, 9, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 72 \].

So, there are 72 3-stars in the given graph. Listing them uniquely, we have:

\[ <4, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <10, (3, 4, 11)>, \]
\[ <11, (0, 5, 11)>, <13, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 11)>, \]
\[ <2, (3, 12, 14)>, <0, (3, 6, 14)>, <14, (0, 1, 9)>, \]
\[ <3, (0, 2, 12)>, <9, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (4, 11, 14)> \]
