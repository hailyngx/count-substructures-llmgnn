Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, we can see that each node has the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 57 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer would be: \[ [57] \]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (8, 14, 0)>, <1, (3, 4, 1)>, <1, (3, 13, 1)>, <1, (4, 8, 1)>, <1, (4, 13, 1)>, <2, (7, 14, 10)>, <2, (7, 5, 2)>, <2, (10, 14, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 3)>, <3, (6, 13, 3)>, <3, (12, 4, 3)>, <4, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (1, 13, 4)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, <5, (1, 11, 5)>, <5, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (2, 11, 5)>, <5, (7, 11, 5)>, <6, (3, 12, 6)>, <6, (6, 8, 6)>, <6, (6, 12, 6)>, <6, (6, 14, 6)>, <6, (9, 12, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 11, 8)>, <8, (4, 11, 8)>, <8, (6, 11, 8)>, <8, (8, 11, 8)>, <8, (9, 11, 8)>, <9, (10, 11, 9)>, <9, (10, 14, 9)>, <9, (10, 2, 9)>, <9, (10, 13, 9)>
