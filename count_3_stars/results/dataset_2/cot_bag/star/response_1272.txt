Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 7, 12, 0, 14, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 12, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For nodes 0, 14, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 1, each has exactly 4 neighbors, so each can form only 1 3-star.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 40 \)

Therefore, there are 40 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

Inside brackets: [40]

Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 8, 13)>, <12, (9, 7, 6)>, <0, (5, 2, 14)>, <14, (9, 3, 6)>, <3, (14, 11, 10)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (12, 14, 2)>, <10, (13, 7, 12)>, <1, (8, 13, 12)>
