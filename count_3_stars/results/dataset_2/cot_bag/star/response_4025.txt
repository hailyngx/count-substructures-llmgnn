Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each such node. 

Given the edge list, let's first find which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [56] \]

Therefore, there are 56 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
