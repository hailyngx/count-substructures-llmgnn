Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 26) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 15) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (19, 13) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (26, 17) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 15) (28, 4) (28, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (23, 24) (20, 7) (20, 14) (4, 26) (4, 16) (4, 28) (12, 24) (12, 22) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 22) (21, 17) (21, 24) (13, 9) (13, 19) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 27) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 10) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 7) (22, 15) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 24) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we have a total of 74 3-stars. So, the final count is [74].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
