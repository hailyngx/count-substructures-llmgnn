Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 12) (12, 17) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula:

\[ \sum_{v \in V} \binom{d(v)}{3} \]

where \( V \) is the set of nodes with three or more neighbors and \( d(v) \) is the degree of node \( v \) (i.e., the number of neighbors).

Calculating for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 40 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 17, 19)>
<6, (16, 17, 6)>
<7, (9, 13, 19)>
<9, (1, 12, 19)>
<10, (1, 14, 4)>
<17, (1, 6, 12)>
<19, (1, 5, 9)>
