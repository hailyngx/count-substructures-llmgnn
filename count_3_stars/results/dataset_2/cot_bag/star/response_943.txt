Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 15, 17, 16}
- Node 4: neighbors {9, 15, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 15, 18}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 12, 4, 8, 19}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {16, 18, 4, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {17, 12, 19}
- Node 12: neighbors {10, 16, 6}
- Node 15: neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 16: neighbors {12, 2, 9, 19}
- Node 17: neighbors {3, 10, 2}
- Node 18: neighbors {9, 5, 1}
- Node 19: neighbors {10, 16, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 15, 17, 16)>
<4, (9, 15, 6)>
<5, (0, 15, 18)>
<6, (3, 12, 8, 19)>
<8, (0, 7, 1, 6)>
<9, (16, 18, 4, 14)>
<10, (17, 12, 19)>
<12, (10, 16, 6)>
<15, (2, 4, 5)>
<16, (12, 2, 9, 19)>
<17, (3, 10, 2)>
<18, (9, 5, 1)>
<19, (10, 16, 6)>
