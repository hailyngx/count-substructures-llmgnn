Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 105 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [105].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 2, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 11)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (1, 2, 14)>

<1, (2, 13, 10)>
<1, (2, 0, 6)>
<1, (12, 9, 7)>
<2, (13, 10, 12)>
<3, (11, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 11)>
<4, (1, 12, 7)>
<4, (3, 11, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 11)>
