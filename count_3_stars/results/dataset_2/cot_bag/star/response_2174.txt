Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 18) (12, 3) (12, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (16, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 48. Therefore, the final answer is [48].
