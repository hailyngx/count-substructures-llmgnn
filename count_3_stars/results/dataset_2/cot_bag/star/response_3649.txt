Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 16) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (18, 15) (19, 15) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 0) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 13, and 14. So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, and 17. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is also \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3, there are 3 neighbors: 8, 15, and 16. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.

For node 5, there are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 11, and 15. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 10, 13, and 16. So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 9. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.

For node 8, there are 2 neighbors: 3 and 7. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed with node 8 as the center.

For node 11, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 14, and 17. So, the number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 17, and 0. So, the number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center is also \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 14, there are 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 11. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.

For node 15, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 18, and 19. So, the number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 16, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6 and 12. So, the number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center is also \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 17, there are 3 neighbors: 2, 13, and 11. So, there is only 1 3-star with node 17 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4  = 35 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 14)>
- <2, (1, 5, 17)>
- <3, (8, 15, 16)>
- <5, (1, 2, 11)>
- <6, (0, 10, 13)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <11, (0, 5, 14)>
- <13, (1, 6, 17)>
- <15, (3, 18, 19)>
- <16, (3, 6, 12)>
