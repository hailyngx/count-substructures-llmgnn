Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars first:

Node 0: Has 4 neighbors -> ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Node 1: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 2: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 3: Has 2 neighbors -> 0 3-stars

Node 4: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 5: Has 2 neighbors -> 0 3-stars

Node 6: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 7: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 8: Has 4 neighbors -> ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Node 9: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 10: Has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Node 11: Has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Node 12: Has 4 neighbors -> ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Node 13: Has 5 neighbors -> ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Node 14: Has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: $4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 75$


Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[75]$.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (11, 2, 14)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 12)>
<4, (6, 10, 13)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<10, (7, 9, 12)>
<11, (0, 2, 8)>
<12, (2, 8, 10)>
<13, (6, 8, 10)>
<14, (0, 3, 13)>
