Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 10, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {7, 10, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {9, 10, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 2, 11, 12}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 8, 5, 0, 14, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: neighbors {13, 5, 6, 2, 9}
- Node 12: neighbors {3, 8, 13, 6, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {8, 4, 7, 12, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [81] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 9, 10)>, <3, (7, 10, 12)>, <4, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (0, 9, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <10, (1, 4, 9)>, <11, (2, 6, 9)>, <12, (3, 8, 14)>, <14, (7, 9, 12)>
