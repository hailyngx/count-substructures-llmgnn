Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
This graph has 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6

Let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0:
Node 0 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 1:
Node 1 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars. 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (4, 5, 3)>

Node 4:
Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>

Node 6:
Node 6 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
<6, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>

Node 9:
Node 9 forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars. 
<9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting all 3-stars, we get a total of [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 48 3-stars. 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3,...2, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
