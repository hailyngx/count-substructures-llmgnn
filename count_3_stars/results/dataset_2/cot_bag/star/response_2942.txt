Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 2 3-stars
- Node 2: 2 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 3-stars
- Node 8: 5 3-stars
- Node 9: 9 3-stars

Adding these up: 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 9 = 33

So, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 9, 9)>
