Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these counts gives us the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 14, 16)>
- <0, (6, 14, 15)>
- <0, (7, 3, 16)>
- <0, (7, 8, 10)>
- <2, (4, 15, 19)>
- <3, (7, 18, 19)>
- <4, (2, 15, 19)>
- <5, (2, 15, 19)>
- <6, (11, 14, 15)>
- <7, (0, 3, 16)>
- <7, (8, 10, 12)>
- <9, (3, 13, 16)>
- <10, (7, 8, 12)>
- <11, (2, 6, 13)>
- <12, (7, 10, 17)>
- <13, (3, 9, 16)>
- <14, (0, 6, 15)>
- <15, (4, 5, 18)>
- <16, (0, 9, 13)>
- <18, (3, 15, 19)>
