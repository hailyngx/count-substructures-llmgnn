Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 21) (27, 14) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (6, 19) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 8) (20, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 5) (29, 13) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 23) (19, 6) (19, 23) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (8, 12) (8, 14) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 3) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 16) (2, 21) (2, 25) (0, 24) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 5) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 0) (21, 13) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 25) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 3) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 0) (11, 18) (11, 21) 

Response:
The central idea here is to determine which nodes have at least three neighbors to form a 3-star. Let's list the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \sum_{\text{node with 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{k}{3} \]

Calculating this for each node mentioned above:

- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up:
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49 \]

Finally, listing the unique 3-stars inside <> brackets:
\[ [49] \]
<4, (13, 7, 12)>, <6, (22, 18, 19)>, <14, (27, 26, 8)>, <16, (12, 24, 14)>, <18, (22, 6, 28)>, <21, (15, 2, 11)>, <23, (20, 29, 19)>, <24, (26, 0, 10)>, <25, (2, 0, 1)>, <28, (22, 5, 17)>, <29, (13, 23, 28)>
