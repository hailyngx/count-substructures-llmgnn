- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.
