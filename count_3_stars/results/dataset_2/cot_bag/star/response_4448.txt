Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 26.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 5], [0, 1, 7], [0, 3, 6], [0, 5, 9], [1, 3, 2], [1, 5, 4], [1, 5, 9], [1, 7, 4], [3, 2, 4], [4, 2, 6], [4, 5, 9], [4, 7, 9], [4, 8, 6], [5, 9, 8], [6, 7, 9], [6, 8, 9], [7, 9, 8]> 

So, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].
