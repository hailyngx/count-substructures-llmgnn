Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, the degrees of each node are as follows:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3

The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 68 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 68. 

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 12)>
<2, (0, 9, 14)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (11, 13, 14)>
<4, (13, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 11, 14)>
<11, (5, 4, 13)>
<12, (7, 10, 11)>
<12, (7, 10, 14)>
<12, (7, 11, 14)>
<13, (4, 6, 7)>
