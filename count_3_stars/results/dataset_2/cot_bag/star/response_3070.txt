Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 13, and 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then find the total:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 10, 14. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 4 as the center.
- <4, (7, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 10, 13)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 13, 14)>, <4, (10, 12, 13)>, <4, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (10, 13, 14)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 7, 9, 14, 2, 11, 13. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with 6 as the center.
- <6, (7, 9, 14)>, <6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (7, 14, 2)>, <6, (7, 14, 11)>, <6, (7, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 11)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 2, 11)>, <6, (9, 2, 13)>, <6, (9, 11, 13)>, <6, (14, 2, 11)>, <6, (14, 2, 13)>, <6, (14, 11, 13)>, <6, (2, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 2, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 2, 11)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 2, 13)>.

For node 7, 13, and 2:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, node 13 has 6 neighbors, and node 2 has 6 neighbors. 
- So, nodes 7, 13, and 2 each form only 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33 3-stars in total, represented as:

[33]
<4, (7, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 10, 13)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 13, 14)>, <4, (10, 12, 13)>, <4, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (10, 13, 14)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <6, (7, 9, 14)>, <6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (7, 14, 2)>, <6, (7, 14, 11)>, <6, (7, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 11)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 2, 11)>, <6, (9, 2, 13)>, <6, (9, 11, 13)>, <6, (14, 2, 11)>, <6, (14, 2, 13)>, <6, (14, 11, 13)>, <6, (2, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 2, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 2, 11)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (9, 2, 13)>, <7, (6, 14, 9)>, <13, (4, 9, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 14)>.
