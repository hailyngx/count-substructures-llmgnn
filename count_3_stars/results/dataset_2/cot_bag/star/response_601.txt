Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6. 

For node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
There are 4 ways to form 3-stars with node 0 as the central node.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 
There are 10 ways to form 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 7)>
<2, (1, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 0)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (8, 7, 0)>
<2, (9, 7, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
There are 4 ways to form 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.
The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<4, (0, 9, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>

For node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
There are 4 ways to form 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>

Adding them up, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the graph.
