Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 22) (15, 4) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 9) (4, 15) (4, 24) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 12) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 15) (22, 10) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 17) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 27) (25, 17) (25, 13) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 21) (23, 18) (23, 26) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 8) (1, 24) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (21, 17) (21, 0) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) (27, 7) (27, 6) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 2, 29, 4, 18, 9, 22, 26, 28, 24, 7, 17, 23, 10, 1, 0, 8, 14, 21, 19, 27, 13, 12, 16, 5, 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ [ \binom{25}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} +  \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} ]\]

\[ = [2300] \]
