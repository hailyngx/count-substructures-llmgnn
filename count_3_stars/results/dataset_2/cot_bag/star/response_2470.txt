Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 18) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 1, 8, 13, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 14, 18, and 2.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 49

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
