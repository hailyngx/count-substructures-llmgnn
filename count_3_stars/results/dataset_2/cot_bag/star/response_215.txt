Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (0, 9) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 7, 4, 18, 3, 19, 8, 16, 1, 0, 15, 2, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[
\binom{6}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{19}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{0}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} = 261
\]

So, there are a total of [261] 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<6, (9, 15, 19)>
<9, (6, 15, 19)>
<15, (6, 9, 8)>
<19, (6, 15, 14)>
<16, (6, 12, 14)>
<10, (9, 17, 12)>
<12, (10, 7, 16)>
<17, (10, 2, 4)>
<7, (12, 18, 8)>
<4, (17, 15, 2)>
<18, (7, 3, 8)>
<3, (11, 18, 15)>
<8, (7, 18, 19)>
<1, (10, 16, 11)>
<0, (9, 6, 15)>
<2, (17, 15, 14)>
<13, (9, 19, 13)>
<14, (19, 16, 2)>
