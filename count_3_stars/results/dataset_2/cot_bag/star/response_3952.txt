Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 27) (6, 19) (6, 20) (6, 16) (0, 2) (0, 23) (0, 19) (2, 0) (2, 23) (2, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (11, 8) (26, 10) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 19) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 18) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 24) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 27) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 16) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 18) (24, 21) (21, 4) (21, 20) (21, 24) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 9) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 15) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors 
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors 
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors 
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors 
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors 

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors. 

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (14, 15, 26)>

For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 8, 21)>, <4, (1, 13, 4)>, <4, (1, 21, 24)>, <4, (8, 13, 4)>
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars: <8, (4, 11, 29)>, <8, (4, 8, 24)>, <8, (4, 8, 29)>, <8, (8, 11, 29)>
- Node 10 forms 4 3-stars: <10, (1, 15, 27)>, <10, (1, 10, 27)>, <10, (10, 15, 27)>, <10, (10, 26, 27)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (10, 12, 27)>
- Node 16 forms 2 3-stars: <16, (1, 18, 20)>, <16, (1, 18, 16)>
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars: <18, (16, 19, 24)>, <18, (16, 18, 24)>, <18, (18, 19, 24)>
- Node 19 forms 10 3-stars: <19, (17, 18, 19)>, <19, (17, 18, 24)>, <19, (17, 19, 27)>, <19, (18, 19, 24)>, <19, (18, 19, 28)>, <19, (19, 27, 28)>, <19, (19, 17, 18)>, <19, (19, 17, 27)>, <19, (19, 18, 24)>, <19, (19, 27, 28)>
- Node 20 forms 2 3-stars: <20, (16, 21, 24)>, <20, (16, 20, 21)>
- Node 21 forms 3 3-stars: <21, (4, 20, 24)>, <21, (4, 21, 24)>, <21, (20, 21, 24)>
- Node 23 forms 2 3-stars: <23, (0, 2, 27)>, <23, (0, 5, 27)>
- Node 24 forms 5 3-stars: <24, (18, 19, 21)>, <24, (18, 19, 24)>, <24, (18, 24, 27)>, <24, (19, 21, 24)>, <24, (21, 24, 28)>
- Node 27 forms 7 3-stars: <27, (9, 10, 27)>, <27, (9, 10, 15)>, <27, (9, 15, 27)>, <27, (10, 26, 27)>, <27, (10, 27, 29)>, <27, (15, 27, 29)>, <27, (26, 27, 29)>
- Node 29 forms 2 3-stars: <29, (7, 8, 27)>, <29, (5, 7, 29)>


Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed, we get [41].
