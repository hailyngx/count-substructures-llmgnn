Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 7) (3, 25) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 21) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (26, 17) (4, 27) (4, 26) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 1) (14, 27) (14, 24) (6, 24) (6, 22) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 1) (24, 2) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 22) (19, 13) (19, 23) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 23) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 7) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 22) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 23) (29, 5) (23, 19) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 17) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 23) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 10) (1, 0) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 20) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 3, 25, 12, 26, 4, 16, 27, 28, 14, 24, 8, 7, 11, 10, 2, 0, 21, 23, 17, 1, and 22.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: No 3-stars can be formed
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors: No 3-stars can be formed
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: No 3-stars can be formed
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star can be formed

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are [52] 3-stars in the given graph.
