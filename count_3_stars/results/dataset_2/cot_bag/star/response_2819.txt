Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's first list the degrees of each node based on the provided edge list:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Nodes 2, 6, 8, and 13 have three or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 44 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (5, 10, 13)>
- <2, (6, 13, 9)>
- <2, (6, 10, 4)>
- <2, (13, 6, 3)>
- <2, (13, 9, 5)>
- <6, (10, 2, 13)>
- <6, (11, 1, 6)>
- <8, (1, 12, 8)>
- <8, (2, 8, 12)>
- <13, (6, 2, 13)>
- <13, (6, 3, 13)>
- <13, (9, 13, 2)>
