Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (10, 11) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 6) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: ${4}\choose{3}$ = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: ${4}\choose{3}$ = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: ${5}\choose{3}$ = 10 3-stars
- Node 11: ${4}\choose{3}$ = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: ${4}\choose{3}$ = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: ${4}\choose{3}$ = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 12>
- <0, 7, 6>
- <0, 8, 1>
- <0, 8, 3>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 8, 13>
- <2, 10, 18>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 1, 8> 
- <6, 17, 18>
- <6, 15, 19>
- <8, 12, 16>
- <11, 5, 18>
- <11, 16, 12>
- <13, 4, 14>
- <15, 12, 16>
