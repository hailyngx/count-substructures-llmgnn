Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 18) (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 22) (16, 11) (16, 24) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (3, 13) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 23) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 5) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 28) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 9) (6, 28) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 5) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 2) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 20) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 0) (9, 10) (9, 29) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 26) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (24, 16) (24, 25) (24, 19) (20, 12) (20, 18) (20, 2) (2, 4) (2, 20) (23, 15) (23, 10) (0, 22) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 19) 

Response:
The three nodes with the most edges are nodes 3, 13, and 28, each with 5 edges. Node 16 also has 4 edges, while nodes 10, 18, 22, and 24 each have 3 edges. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together gives a total of 30 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 10, 27)>
<13, (8, 14, 22)>
<28, (5, 7, 12)>
