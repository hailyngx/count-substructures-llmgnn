Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
