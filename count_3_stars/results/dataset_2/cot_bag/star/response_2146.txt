Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. 

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 15, 18)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 7, 18)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 8, 10)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 8, 15)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 5, 14)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 4, 10)
- Node 9: 2 3-stars (9, 8, 15), (9, 11, 2)
- Node 12: 2 3-stars (12, 0, 16), (12, 13, 17)
- Node 15: 2 3-stars (15, 1, 18), (15, 7, 19)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (16, 0, 12)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of [12] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 15, 18>, 
<3, 7, 18>, 
<4, 8, 10>, 
<5, 8, 15>, 
<6, 5, 14>, 
<9, 8, 15>, 
<9, 11, 2>, 
<12, 0, 16>, 
<12, 13, 17>, 
<15, 1, 18>, 
<15, 7, 19>, 
<16, 0, 12>.
