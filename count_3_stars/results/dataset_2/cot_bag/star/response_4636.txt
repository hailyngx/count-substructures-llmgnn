Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (3, 17) (3, 11) (25, 4) (25, 22) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 7) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 8) (22, 25) (22, 5) (24, 4) (24, 13) (21, 0) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 28) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 16) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 15) (29, 7) (7, 14) (7, 27) (7, 29) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (20, 14) (20, 4) (18, 6) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 15) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 19) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 16) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 4) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the above nodes, we get:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

Summing these up gives a total of 108 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is \( [108] \).

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (9, 11, 18)>, <2, (11, 13, 16)>, <4, (10, 15, 24)>, <5, (13, 22, 28)>, <6, (17, 18, 9)>, <7, (14, 27, 29)>, <9, (0, 12, 17)>, <12, (2, 27, 9)>, <13, (2, 16, 5)>, <14, (7, 17, 20)>, <16, (2, 19, 23)>, <17, (6, 14, 9)>, <18, (0, 15, 27)>, <22, (5, 25, 28)>, <23, (16, 17, 2)>, <26, (1, 8, 26)>, <27, (7, 18, 12)>, <28, (5, 19, 8)>
