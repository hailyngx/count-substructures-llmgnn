Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information.  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: 
- Node 0: {0, 2}, {0, 9}
- Node 1: {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 5}, {1, 7}, {1, 8}, {1, 9}
- Node 2: {2, 0}, {2, 1}, {2, 6}, {2, 8}
- Node 3: {3, 1}, {3, 5}
- Node 4: {4, 5}, {4, 6}, {4, 8}
- Node 5: {5, 1}, {5, 3}, {5, 4}, {5, 7}, {5, 8}
- Node 6: {6, 2}, {6, 4}, {6, 7}, {6, 8}, {6, 9}
- Node 7: {7, 1}, {7, 5}, {7, 6}, {7, 9}
- Node 8: {8, 2}, {8, 4}, {8, 5}, {8, 6}, {8, 1}
- Node 9: {9, 0}, {9, 1}, {9, 6}, {9, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.  
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58  
Therefore, there are [58] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>,  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>,  
<5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>,  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>,  
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
