Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.
- Node 2: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
- Node 4: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
- Node 6: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.
- Node 7: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
- Node 8: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.
- Node 9: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
