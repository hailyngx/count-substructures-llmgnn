Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 17) (14, 27) (14, 19) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 23) (3, 19) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 18) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 0) (22, 8) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 28) (7, 20) (7, 27) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 4) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 5) (4, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 4) (18, 20) (15, 21) (15, 0) (20, 7) (20, 18) (20, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (28, 23) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 6) (0, 22) (0, 15) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 29) (10, 13) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (8, 22) (8, 21) (8, 11) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 3) (11, 9) (11, 20) (11, 5) (11, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it also contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-stars.

Adding up all the contributions, we get \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 52\) 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
