Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 1) (4, 18) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (16, 17) (16, 7) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 15) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 16: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up, we get 29 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
