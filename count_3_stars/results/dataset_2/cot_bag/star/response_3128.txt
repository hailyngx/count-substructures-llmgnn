Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with the most neighbors:

- Node 9 has 9 neighbors
- Node 14 has 8 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 9: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(84 + 56 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 186\).

So, the final answer is \([186]\), and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <9, (5, 8, 12)>
- <14, (9, 4, 7)>
- <4, (7, 10, 13)>
- <8, (9, 11, 0)>
- <1, (9, 4, 11)>
- <0, (9, 10, 14)>
- <13, (8, 2, 3)>
- <12, (5, 6, 14)>
