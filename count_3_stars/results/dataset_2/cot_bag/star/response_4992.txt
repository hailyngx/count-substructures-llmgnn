Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
