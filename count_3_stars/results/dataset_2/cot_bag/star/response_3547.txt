Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 4) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 2) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 12) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 15) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (6, 2) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 7) (9, 14) (9, 16) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (18, 4), (0, 18), (0, 19), (19, 0)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <0, (18, 4, 19)>, <0, (18, 4, 0)>, <0, (18, 19, 0)>, <0, (4, 19, 0)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (11, 1), (13, 1), (12, 1)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <1, (11, 13, 12)>

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (3, 2), (11, 2), (6, 2), (10, 2)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <2, (3, 11, 6)>, <2, (3, 11, 10)>, <2, (3, 6, 10)>, <2, (11, 6, 10)>

4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (14, 4), (13, 4), (18, 4), (4, 0), (4, 5)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars: <4, (14, 18, 5)>, <4, (14, 18, 0)>, <4, (14, 5, 0)>, <4, (18, 5, 0)>, <4, (13, 18, 5)>, <4, (13, 18, 0)>, <4, (13, 5, 0)>, <4, (18, 5, 0)>, <4, (13, 14, 5)>, <4, (13, 14, 0)>

5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (18, 7), (13, 7), (15, 7)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <7, (18, 13, 15)>

6. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (2, 10), (8, 10), (19, 10)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <10, (2, 8, 19)>

7. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (1, 11), (2, 11), (15, 11)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <11, (1, 2, 15)>

8. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (1, 12), (18, 12), (16, 12)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-stars: <12, (1, 18, 16)>

9. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (17, 13), (1, 13), (4, 13), (7, 13)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars: <13, (17, 1, 4)>, <13, (17, 1, 7)>, <13, (17, 4, 7)>, <13, (1, 4, 7)>

10. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (17, 16), (12, 16), (9, 16), (19, 16)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    3-stars: <16, (17, 12, 9)>, <16, (17, 12, 19)>, <16, (17, 9, 19)>, <16, (12, 9, 19)>

11. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (13, 17), (16, 17), (19, 17), (8, 17)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    3-stars: <17, (13, 16, 19)>, <17, (13, 16, 8)>, <17, (13, 19, 8)>, <17, (16, 19, 8)>

12. Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (4, 18), (18, 15), (18, 7), (18, 0), (12, 18)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    3-stars: <18, (4, 15, 7)>, <18, (4, 15, 0)>, <18, (4, 7, 0)>, <18, (4, 15, 12)>, <18, (4, 7, 12)>, <18, (4, 0, 12)>, <18, (15, 7, 0)>, <18, (15, 7, 12)>, <18, (15, 0, 12)>, <18, (7, 0, 12)>

13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (17, 19), (16, 19), (10, 19), (0, 19)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    3-stars: <19, (17, 16, 10)>, <19, (17, 16, 0)>, <19, (17, 10, 0)>, <19, (16, 10, 0)>

Summing up all the 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
