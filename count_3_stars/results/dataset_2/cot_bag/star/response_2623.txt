Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (0, 27) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 5) (27, 8) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (17, 29) (17, 15) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 13) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 22) (22, 24) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 3) (26, 0) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 12) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 20) (3, 22) (3, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 19) (23, 5) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 5) (16, 21) (16, 3) (16, 8) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 23) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 20) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 12) (20, 13) (20, 8) (20, 6) (20, 9) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 9) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, and 27.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 47 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 26, 27)>
<2, (0, 15, 18)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (9, 20, 25)>
<9, (6, 8, 20)>
<11, (4, 18, 19)>
<15, (2, 10, 17)>
<16, (3, 8, 21)>
<17, (15, 21, 29)>
<21, (17, 24, 26)>
<22, (12, 24, 26)>
<24, (9, 21, 22)>
<26, (12, 13, 14)>
<27, (0, 5, 8)>
