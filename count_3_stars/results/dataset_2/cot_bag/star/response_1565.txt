Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [100].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<2, (5, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 12)>
<9, (1, 3, 14)>
<10, (6, 7, 12)>
<11, (3, 7, 8)>
<12, (5, 10, 13)>
<13, (2, 6, 14)>
<14, (1, 9, 13)>
