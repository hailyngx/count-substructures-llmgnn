Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors in the given graph are:
1: 3, 4, 5, 7
3: 1, 6, 5, 8
4: 1, 8, 9, 5, 6
8: 3, 4, 9, 7
5: 1, 3, 4, 2
6: 3, 4, 7, 2
2: 5, 6, 9, 0
0: 2, 7, 9
7: 1, 8, 6, 0
9: 4, 8, 2, 0

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>

<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>

<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (8, 7, 1)>
<4, (8, 9, 7)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<4, (8, 7, 3)>

<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>

<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<5, (3, 6, 4)>

<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>

<2, (5, 6, 9)>
