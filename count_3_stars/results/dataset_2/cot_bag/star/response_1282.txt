Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2  
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3

After checking the degrees, we see that the potential 3-stars can be formed with the center nodes:
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 12
- Node 16
- Node 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each potential center node:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

So, the final answer is [32].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 1, 14)>
- <2, (0, 14, 10)>
- <2, (1, 5, 3)>
- <2, (1, 14, 10)>
- <2, (5, 3, 1)>
- <4, (6, 0, 18)>
- <4, (0, 6, 18)>
- <4, (6, 18, 9)>
- <4, (18, 6, 9)>
- <12, (9, 18, 14)>
- <12, (9, 14, 15)>
- <12, (18, 9, 14)>
- <12, (18, 9, 14)>
- <12, (14, 9, 15)>
- <16, (8, 10, 2)>
- <16, (10, 8, 2)>
- <17, (15, 14, 9)>
- <17, (15, 14, 12)>
- <17, (15, 9, 14)>
- <17, (15, 14, 12)>
