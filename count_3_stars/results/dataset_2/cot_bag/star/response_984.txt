Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 12, 2. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 7, 14, 11. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 14)>, <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <2, (4, 7, 11)>, <2, (4, 14, 11)>, <2, (8, 7, 14)>, <2, (8, 7, 11)>, <2, (8, 14, 11)>, <2, (7, 14, 11)>.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 13, 12, 8, 4. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <3, (9, 13, 12)>, <3, (9, 13, 8)>, <3, (9, 13, 4)>, <3, (9, 12, 8)>, <3, (9, 12, 4)>, <3, (9, 8, 4)>, <3, (13, 12, 8)>, <3, (13, 12, 4)>, <3, (13, 8, 4)>, <3, (12, 8, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 2, 13. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 13)>, <4, (1, 8, 2)>, <4, (1, 8, 13)>, <4, (1, 2, 13)>, <4, (3, 8, 2)>, <4, (3, 8, 13)>, <4, (3, 2, 13)>, <4, (8, 2, 13)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, 13. So, there is 1 3-star: <6, (9, 7, 13)>.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 6, 12, 11, 2, 5. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (6, 12, 11)>, <7, (6, 12, 2)>, <7, (6, 12, 5)>, <7, (6, 11, 2)>, <7, (6, 11, 5)>, <7, (6, 2, 5)>, <7, (12, 11, 2)>, <7, (12, 11, 5)>, <7, (12, 2, 5)>, <7, (11, 2, 5)>.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 2, 5, 14. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 2)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 14)>, <8, (3, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 2, 14)>, <8, (3, 5, 14)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 14)>, <8, (4, 5, 14)>, <8, (2, 5, 14)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 14, 3, 12. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (6, 14, 3)>, <9, (6, 14, 12)>, <9, (6, 3, 12)>, <9, (14, 3, 12)>.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 2. So, there is 1 3-star: <11, (1, 7, 2)>.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: 9, 3, 7, 10, 14, 0. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, 4. So, there is 1 3-star: <13, (6, 3, 4)>.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 9, 8, 12, 2, 10. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <14, (9, 8, 12)>, <14, (9, 8, 2)>, <14, (9, 8, 10)>, <14, (9, 12, 2)>, <14, (9, 12, 10)>, <14, (9, 2, 10)>, <14, (8, 12, 2)>, <14, (8, 12, 10)>, <14, (8, 2, 10)>, <14, (12, 2, 10)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars identified, we get a total of 67 3-stars in this graph: [67].
