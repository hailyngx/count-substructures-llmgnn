Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 19) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (16, 2) (16, 6) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 3) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 4) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <0, (1, 9, 18)>, <0, (1, 11, 18)>, <0, (1, 18, 9)>, <0, (9, 11, 18)>, <0, (1, 9, 11)>, 
   <0, (1, 9, 19)>, <0, (1, 11, 19)>, <0, (11, 18, 7)>, <0, (11, 18, 3)>, <0, (9, 18, 7)>

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <1, (0, 11, 19)>, <1, (0, 17, 19)>, <1, (0, 17, 14)>, <1, (11, 19, 17)>, <1, (11, 19, 2)>, 
  <1, (0, 17, 14)>, <1, (17, 14, 4)>, <1, (17, 14, 15)>, <1, (17, 19, 2)>, <1, (19, 2, 6)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (5, 14, 19)>, <4, (5, 14, 3)>, <4, (5, 19, 14)>, <4, (14, 19, 15)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (1, 14, 19)>, <5, (1, 4, 14)>, <5, (1, 13, 4)>, <5, (13, 4, 6)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <6, (2, 16, 19)>, <6, (2, 19, 4)>, <6, (16, 2, 19)>, <6, (16, 2, 6)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (12, 15, 18)>, <7, (12, 15, 14)>, <7, (12, 15, 1)>, <7, (15, 14, 1)>

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <10, (6, 18, 11)>

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <11, (0, 9, 15)>, <11, (0, 15, 14)>, <11, (10, 18, 6)>, <11, (15, 14, 1)>

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <13, (5, 6, 3)>

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <15, (7, 14, 1)>, <15, (7, 14, 4)>, <15, (7, 18, 3)>, <15, (14, 4, 1)>

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <18, (0, 3, 7)>, <18, (0, 7, 12)>, <18, (0, 7, 15)>, <18, (3, 7, 12)>

- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <19, (1, 17, 2)>, <19, (1, 17, 4)>, <19, (2, 6, 16)>, <19, (2, 6, 4)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [56].
