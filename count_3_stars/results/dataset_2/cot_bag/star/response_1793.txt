Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are connected as follows:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9, and 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars: nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 52 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
