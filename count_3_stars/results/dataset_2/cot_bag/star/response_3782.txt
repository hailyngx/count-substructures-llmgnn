Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 56 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
