Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 26) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 13) (23, 19) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 24) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 10) (24, 14) (24, 26) (24, 12) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (7, 20) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 29) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 24) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 29) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 10) (28, 3) (15, 5) (15, 19) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 6) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 18) (20, 26) (20, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (6, 2) (6, 29) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 8, 14, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: $1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23$

So, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
