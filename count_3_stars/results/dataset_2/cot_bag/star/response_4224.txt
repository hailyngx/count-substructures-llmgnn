Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (18, 16) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 8) (6, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 11, 16, 5, 13, and 19.

For node 11:
- Combining adjacent edges, we see that node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 13, 6, and 4. So, it has 5 neighbors.
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 11 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 11 as the center: <11, (16, 13, 6)>, <11, (16, 13, 4)>, <11, (16, 6, 4)>, <11, (13, 6, 4)>.

For node 16:
- Combining adjacent edges, we see that node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 18, and 2. So, it has 4 neighbors.
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 16 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 16 as the center: <16, (11, 17, 18)>.

For node 5:
- Combining adjacent edges, we see that node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 8, 1, and 0. So, it has 5 neighbors.
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 9, 8)>, <5, (3, 9, 1)>, <5, (3, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>.

For node 13:
- Combining adjacent edges, we see that node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 9, 17, 10, and 19. So, it has 5 neighbors.
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 13 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 13 as the center: <13, (11, 9, 17)>, <13, (11, 9, 10)>, <13, (11, 9, 19)>, <13, (11, 17, 10)>.

For node 19:
- Combining adjacent edges, we see that node 19 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 12. So, it has 3 neighbors.
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 19 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Unique 3-star with node 19 as the center: <19, (14, 13, 12)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
