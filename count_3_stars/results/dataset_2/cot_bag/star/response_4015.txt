Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 2) (3, 6) (25, 6) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 20) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 29) (21, 20) (21, 15) (12, 7) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 29) (27, 12) (27, 0) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 24) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (0, 12) (0, 27) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 20) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 28) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 5) (29, 4) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 16) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 29) (28, 2) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 1) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 19) (9, 2) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 29) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [53].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (6, 29, 4)>
<6, (4, 24, 6)>
<7, (29, 7, 12)>
<12, (7, 0, 12)>
<15, (5, 10, 15)>
<16, (24, 16, 19)>
<18, (18, 22, 8)>
<20, (21, 1, 20)>
<23, (16, 23, 20)>
<25, (19, 25, 6)>
<26, (10, 26, 15)>
<29, (4, 29, 5)>
