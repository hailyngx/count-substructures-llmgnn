Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 9) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (19, 18) (19, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 2) (17, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 9, 6, 8, 13, 4, 7, 12, 18, 5, 0, 15, 14, 2, 3, and 10.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:

- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
