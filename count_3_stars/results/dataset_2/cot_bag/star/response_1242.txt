Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 11, 6.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 13, 12, 11, 3, 14.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 13, 3, 11.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 12, 10, 2, 1.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 4, 12, 0, 3, 1, 10.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 0, 1, 6.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 7, 5, 10, 14, 9.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 12, 5, 3, 1.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (8, 9, 11)>, <4, (8, 9, 6)>, <4, (8, 11, 6)>, <4, (9, 11, 6)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (13, 12, 11)>, <5, (13, 12, 3)>, <5, (13, 12, 14)>, <5, (13, 11, 3)>, <5, (13, 11, 14)>, <5, (12, 11, 3)>, <5, (12, 11, 14)>, <5, (11, 3, 14)>, <5, (12, 3, 14)>, <5, (11, 3, 14)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. (similar to Node 5)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (4, 12, 0)>, <9, (4, 12, 3)>, <9, (4, 12, 1)>, <9, (4, 12, 10)>, <9, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 0, 1)>, <9, (4, 0, 10)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 10)>, <9, (4, 1, 10)>, <9, (12, 0, 3)>, <9, (12, 0, 1)>, <9, (12, 0, 10)>, <9, (12, 3, 1)>, <9, (12, 3, 10)>, <9, (12, 1, 10)>, <9, (0, 3, 1)>, <9, (0, 3, 10)>, <9, (0, 1, 10)>, <9, (3, 1, 10)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. (similar to Node 5)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. (similar to Node 5)

Additionally:
- Node 7 and Node 14 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each contributes 1 3-star only.

Therefore, adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 66 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].
