Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 60 \)

So, there are [60] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 13, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (6, 3, 2)>, <0, (14, 10, 6)>, <0, (6, 5, 13)>, <2, (9, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 3, 7)>, <2, (7, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (7, 3, 12)>, <3, (6, 0, 5)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 13, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 2, 12)>, <5, (9, 2, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <6, (10, 3, 7)>, <6, (10, 7, 2)>, <6, (10, 7, 2)>, <6, (13, 5, 7)>, <6, (13, 7, 5)>, <7, (2, 6, 3)>, <7, (2, 6, 3)>, <10, (14, 4, 0)>, <10, (1, 7, 4)>, <11, (1, 7, 3)>, <12, (9, 3, 11)>, <12, (9, 11, 3)>, <13, (7, 6, 5)>
