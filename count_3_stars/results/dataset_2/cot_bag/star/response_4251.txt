Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 1, 4, 7}

Following the steps mentioned earlier:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, contributing 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 0)>
<5, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (9, 1, 5)>
