Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes and the number of neighbors they have:

Node 5: 6 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 1 neighbor

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 61 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (2, 4, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
