Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (16, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 23) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 13) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 23) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 22) (22, 11) (22, 9) (21, 6) (21, 26) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 2) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 13) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 18) (25, 27) (25, 2) (2, 27) (2, 25) (1, 20) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 8) (24, 17) (5, 15) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 5) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (17, 24) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 29) (3, 23) (3, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 20, 14, 28, and 17 (degree 4)
- Node 4: connected to nodes 7, 9, 13, and 23 (degree 4)
- Node 8: connected to nodes 11, 16, 20, 24, and 5 (degree 5)
- Node 14: connected to nodes 0, 6, 18, and 13 (degree 4)
- Node 16: connected to nodes 11, 24, 8, and 9 (degree 4)
- Node 19: connected to nodes 11, 7, 29, and 23 (degree 4)
- Node 23: connected to nodes 4, 28, 19, and 3 (degree 4)
- Node 26: connected to nodes 15, 21, and 18 (degree 3)
- Node 27: connected to nodes 29, 25, and 2 (degree 3)
- Node 29: connected to nodes 28, 27, 19, and 3 (degree 4)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <0, (20, 14, 28)>, <0, (20, 14, 17)>, <0, (20, 28, 17)>, <0, (14, 28, 17)>
  
- For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <4, (7, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 9, 23)>, <4, (7, 13, 23)>, <4, (9, 13, 23)>
  
- For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
  <8, (11, 16, 20)>, <8, (11, 16, 24)>, <8, (11, 16, 5)>, <8, (11, 24, 5)>, <8, (16, 20, 24)>, <8, (16, 20, 5)>, <8, (16, 24, 5)>, <8, (20, 24, 5)>, <8, (11, 8, 5)>, <8, (16, 8, 5)>
  
- For node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <14, (0, 6, 18)>, <14, (0, 6, 13)>, <14, (0, 18, 13)>, <14, (6, 18, 13)>
  
- For node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <16, (11, 24, 8)>, <16, (11, 24, 9)>, <16, (11, 8, 5)>, <16, (24, 8, 5)>
  
- For node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <19, (11, 7, 29)>, <19, (11, 7, 23)>, <19, (7, 29, 23)>, <19, (11, 29, 23)>
  
- For node 23: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <23, (4, 28, 19)>, <23, (4, 28, 3)>, <23, (28, 19, 3)>, <23, (4, 19, 3)>
  
- For node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <29, (28, 27, 19)>, <29, (28, 27, 3)>, <29, (27, 19, 3)>, <29, (28, 19, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
