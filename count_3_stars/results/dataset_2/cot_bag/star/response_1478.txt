Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 12) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 25) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 9) (21, 2) (21, 7) (21, 28) (8, 28) (8, 22) (23, 19) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 4) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 10) (13, 26) (13, 14) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 11) (1, 22) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 16) (4, 17) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 29) (12, 4) (12, 16) (22, 8) (22, 1) (22, 0) (16, 2) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 0) (14, 28) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 9) (6, 25) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 27) (0, 22) (0, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 14) (18, 19) (18, 20) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 20) (27, 6) (27, 20) (5, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
- 0: (22)
- 1: (11, 25)
- 2: (16, 21, 29)
- 3: (9, 10, 25, 28)
- 4: (12, 17, 26)
- 5: (11)
- 6: (17, 25, 26, 27)
- 7: (9, 21, 24)
- 8: (22, 28)
- 9: (3, 7, 14)
- 10: (3, 13, 26)
- 11: (1, 5)
- 12: (4, 16, 29)
- 13: (10, 14, 26)
- 14: (9, 13, 26, 28)
- 16: (2, 12, 16, 19)
- 17: (4, 6, 29)
- 18: (19, 20)
- 19: (16, 18, 23)
- 20: (18, 24, 27)
- 21: (2, 7, 28)
- 22: (0, 1, 8)
- 23: (19)
- 24: (7, 20, 28)
- 25: (1, 3, 6, 11)
- 26: (4, 6, 10, 13)
- 27: (6, 20)
- 28: (3, 8, 14, 21, 24)
- 29: (2, 12, 17)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2: <2, (16, 21, 29)>
2. Node 3: <3, (9, 10, 25)>; <3, (9, 28, 10)>
3. Node 4: <4, (12, 16, 29)>
4. Node 6: <6, (17, 25, 26)>; <6, (17, 25, 27)>
5. Node 9: <9, (3, 7, 14)>; <9, (3, 14, 28)>; <9, (7, 14, 28)>
6. Node 11: <11, (1, 5, 25)>
7. Node 12: <12, (16, 17, 29)>
8. Node 14: <14, (9, 13, 26)>; <14, (9, 13, 28)>
9. Node 16: <16, (2, 12, 29)>; <16, (2, 12, 19)>
10. Node 17: <17, (4, 6, 29)>
11. Node 19: <19, (16, 18, 23)>
12. Node 20: <20, (18, 24, 27)>
13. Node 21: <21, (2, 7, 28)>
14. Node 22: <22, (0, 1, 8)>
15. Node 25: <25, (1, 3, 6)>
16. Node 26: <26, (4, 6, 10)>
17. Node 28: <28, (3, 8, 14)>; <28, (3, 24, 8)>
18. Node 29: <29, (2, 12, 17)>
