Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 1) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 14) (27, 16) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 22) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 21) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 21) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (6, 3) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 11) (8, 5) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (24, 9) (24, 0) (24, 11) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 28) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (21, 20) (21, 18) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 10) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 29) (29, 27) (29, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 3, 15, 1, 12, 20, 27, 0, 5, 6, 22, 8, 24, 11, 28, 17, 19, 18, 16, 14, and 29.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: there's 1 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{k}{3} \), where \( k \) represents the number of neighbors of the node.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For node 9: 1 3-star
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<9, (26, 18, 20)>, 
<26, (9, 20, 22)>, 
<3, (15, 10, 6)>, 
<15, (3, 17, 10)>, 
<1, (25, 5, 12)>, 
<12, (1, 19, 27)>, 
<20, (9, 0, 21)>, 
<27, (12, 29, 14)>, 
<0, (20, 16, 24)>, 
<5, (1, 17, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 15)>, 
<22, (26, 0, 11)>, 
<8, (5, 23, 19)>, 
<24, (9, 0, 11)>, 
<11, (22, 24, 28)>, 
<28, (4, 17, 11)>,
