Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- 3: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- 4: {0, 2, 7}
- 5: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- 6: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- 7: {3, 4, 6}
- 8: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- 9: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). 

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 5: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 52

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 5)>.
