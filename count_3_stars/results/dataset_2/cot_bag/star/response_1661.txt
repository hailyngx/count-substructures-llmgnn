Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 1) (9, 18) (18, 7) (18, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with number of neighbors are:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 13: Less than 3 neighbors
- For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 7: Less than 3 neighbors
- For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 9: Less than 3 neighbors
- For node 18: Less than 3 neighbors
- For node 6: Less than 3 neighbors
- For node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding up the number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
1. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
2. <3, (1, 10, 0)>
3. <3, (10, 17, 2)>
4. <3, (10, 17, 11)>
5. <10, (3, 17, 12)>
6. <10, (2, 17, 11)>
7. <17, (10, 7, 11)>
8. <2, (10, 8, 11)>
9. <8, (2, 16, 11)>
10. <5, (1, 13, 15)>
11. <0, (3, 15, 4)>
12. <4, (0, 12, 15)>
13. <12, (10, 4, 14)>
14. <12, (4, 15, 12)>
15. <12, (4, 14, 19)>
16. <14, (12, 19, 16)>
17. <19, (6, 14, 16)>
18. <15, (5, 0, 4)>
19. <16, (8, 14, 19)>
20. <11, (17, 2, 8)>
21. <11, (17, 13, 6)>
