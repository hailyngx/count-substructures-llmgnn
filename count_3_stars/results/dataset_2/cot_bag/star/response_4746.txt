Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[
\binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 47
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 1)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 8, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>
