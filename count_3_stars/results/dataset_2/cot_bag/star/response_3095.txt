Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbours: nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 4: C(7,3) = 35
- Node 5: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 6: C(6,3) = 20
- Node 7: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 8: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 9: C(7,3) = 35

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of [109] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 2, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 2, 4)>
