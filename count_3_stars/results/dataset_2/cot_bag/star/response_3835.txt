Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 18) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 11) (13, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 6) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 9) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 8) (16, 1) (6, 12) (6, 18) (14, 19) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows: 
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

Computing the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [2]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [3] - <7, (4, 2, 13)>
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [0]
- Node 13: [0]
- Node 14: [0]
- Node 15: [0]
- Node 16: [0]
- Node 17: [0]
- Node 18: [0]
- Node 19: [1]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [3]

The unique 3-star found is: <7, (4, 2, 13)>
