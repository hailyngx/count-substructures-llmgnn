Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 2
- Node 1: 4, 7, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 9, 4, 7, 3, 8, 0
- Node 3: 5, 9, 1, 2
- Node 4: 9, 7, 2, 0, 1
- Node 5: 6, 3, 7
- Node 6: 5, 1, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 2, 1
- Node 8: 1, 6, 2
- Node 9: 4, 2, 3, 7

Looking at the nodes, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 3, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 7, 3)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 2, 0)>
<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<7, (9, 2, 3)>
