Response:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1: (20, 21, 28)
- Node 2: (10)
- Node 3: (13, 19)
- Node 4: (12, 21)
- Node 5: (8, 20, 27)
- Node 6: (18)
- Node 7: (8, 14, 26, 29)
- Node 8: (5, 17, 23, 29)
- Node 9: (15, 16, 25, 28)
- Node 10: (2, 12)
- Node 11: (14, 20)
- Node 12: (4, 10, 13)
- Node 13: (3, 12, 25)
- Node 14: (7, 11)
- Node 15: (9, 16, 24)
- Node 16: (9, 15, 22, 28)
- Node 17: (8, 18, 28)
- Node 18: (6, 17, 19, 22)
- Node 19: (0, 3, 18, 22, 25)
- Node 20: (1, 5, 11)
- Node 21: (1, 4, 27, 29)
- Node 22: (16, 18, 19, 29)
- Node 23: (0, 8, 27)
- Node 24: (15, 26)
- Node 25: (9, 13, 19)
- Node 26: (7, 24, 27)
- Node 27: (5, 21, 23, 26)
- Node 28: (1, 9, 16, 17)
- Node 29: (7, 21, 22, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1] = [77] \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 77. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (20, 21, 28)>, <3, (13, 19, 25)>, <15, (9, 16, 25)>, <18, (6, 17, 19)>, <19, (0, 18, 22)>, <22, (16, 18, 29)>
