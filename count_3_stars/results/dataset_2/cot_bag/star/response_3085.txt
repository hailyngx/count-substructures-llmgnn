Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 29) (22, 3) (7, 25) (21, 0) (21, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 20) (10, 29) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 12) (20, 10) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (28, 0) (28, 29) (29, 22) (29, 10) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 26) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 17) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 26) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 13) (25, 7) (25, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 14) (27, 20) (27, 3) (11, 21) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 25) (14, 20) (14, 13) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 15) (26, 2) (26, 16) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (2, 26) (2, 24) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 16) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 54 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ <0, (12, 20, 28)>, <9, (12, 13, 17)>, <10, (20, 22, 24)>, <11, (8, 12, 25)>, <13, (9, 17, 19)>, <17, (1, 13, 19)>, <20, (10, 14, 27)>, <22, (10, 18, 29)>, <26, (2, 15, 16)>, <29, (0, 26, 28)> \]

Putting this final count inside brackets: [54].
