Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (10, 16) (10, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (19, 15) (19, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 26 nodes in this graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 11, 6, 14 <1, (11, 6, 14)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 11, 4, 5, 17 <2, (11, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 5, 2 <4, (6, 8, 5)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 18, 4, 8 <6, (1, 18, 4)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 10, 7 <8, (6, 4, 10)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 11, 16, 13 <9, (11, 16, 13)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 16, 14, 1, 9, 2 <11, (16, 14, 1)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 9, 17, 12 <13, (9, 17, 12)>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 11, 15, 0, 1 <14, (11, 15, 0)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 19, 18, 14 <15, (19, 18, 14)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 11, 18, 9, 10 <16, (11, 18, 9)>
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 16, 15, 6, 7 <18, (16, 15, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives [12].
