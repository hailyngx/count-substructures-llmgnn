Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (6, 9) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 16) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 9) (23, 8) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 4) (20, 5) (25, 1) (25, 11) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 0) (4, 20) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 24) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 10) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 28) (11, 0) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 7) (13, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (27, 26) (27, 29) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 12) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 20) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 16) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (12, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 2) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 4) (5, 15) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 14) (14, 21) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 6, 1, 3, 22, 23, 20, 25, 8, 4, 18, 21, 28, 11, 17, 7, 0, 27, 29, 15, 16, 10, 12, 24, 5, and 2.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, 26, 6>
<1, 3, 22>
<23, 20, 25>
<8, 4, 18>
<21, 28, 11>
<17, 7, 0>
<27, 29, 15>
<16, 10, 12>
<24, 5, 2>
