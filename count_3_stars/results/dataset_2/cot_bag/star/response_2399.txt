Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 18) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 0) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 possible 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
