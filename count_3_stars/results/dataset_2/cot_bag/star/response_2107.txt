Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
