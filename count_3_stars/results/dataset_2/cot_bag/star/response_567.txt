Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 19) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 16) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 3: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 4: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars = \(C(3,3)\) = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 8: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 10: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 14: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 15: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 16: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 17: 3-stars = \(C(4,3)\) = 4
- Node 19: 3-stars = \(C(3,3)\) = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 13, 2)>
<3, (1, 9, 10)>
<4, (16, 7, 1)>
<6, (10, 2, 19)>
<7, (1, 15, 4)>
<8, (9, 0, 11)>
<10, (3, 16, 6)>
<14, (17, 13, 19)>
<15, (7, 18, 12)>
<16, (10, 18, 0)>
<17, (5, 14, 10)>
<19, (6, 12, 14)>
