Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 3) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 12) (20, 27) (20, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 22) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 10) (17, 28) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 5) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 18) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 22) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 24) (24, 27) (24, 22) (19, 15) (19, 23) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 22) (6, 25) (6, 14) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 23) 

Response:
There are six nodes with three or more neighbors: 3, 4, 10, 13, 15, 26.

For node 3: 
- There are edges to nodes 25, 26, 29. So, there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center. 
Resulting 3-star: <3, (25, 26, 29)>

For node 4: 
- There are edges to nodes 2, 9, 22. So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center. 
Resulting 3-star: <4, (2, 9, 22)>

For node 10: 
- There are edges to nodes 15, 18, 27, 28, 29. So, there are 1 + 5 choose 3 = 6 3-stars with node 10 as the center. 
Resulting 3-stars: <10, (15, 18, 27)>, <10, (15, 18, 28)>, <10, (15, 18, 29)>, <10, (15, 27, 28)>, <10, (15, 27, 29)>, <10, (18, 27, 28)>

For node 13: 
- There are edges to nodes 8, 9, 15. So, there is 1 3-star with node 13 as the center. 
Resulting 3-star: <13, (8, 9, 15)>

For node 15 and node 26: 
- Each has 1 neighbor too few to form a 3-star. 

In total, there are <3, (25, 26, 29)>, <4, (2, 9, 22)>, <10, (15, 18, 27)>, <10, (15, 18, 28)>, <10, (15, 18, 29)>, <10, (15, 27, 28)>, <10, (15, 27, 29)>, <10, (18, 27, 28)>, <13, (8, 9, 15)>. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [9].
