Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 19) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (21, 28) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 23) (11, 17) (11, 19) (23, 28) (23, 25) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 29) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 0) (6, 18) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 5) (24, 28) (24, 6) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 0) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 11) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 14) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 18) (25, 23) (25, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 45 \)

Therefore, there are 45 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Putting the final result inside brackets: [45].
