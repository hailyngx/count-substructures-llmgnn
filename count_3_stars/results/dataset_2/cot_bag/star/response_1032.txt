This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 21) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 6) (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 17) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 11) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 10) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 11) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (20, 11) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 5) (3, 26) (3, 24) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 23) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (28, 15) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 12) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 12) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 5) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 18) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 12) (23, 0) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<0, (7, 24, 23)\>
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. \<1, (21, 29, 17)>, \<1, (21, 29, 1)>, \<1, (21, 17, 5)>, \<1, (29, 17, 5)\>
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<2, (16, 11, 8)\>
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<4, (19, 11, 28)\>
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. \<5, (26, 17, 24)>, \<5, (26, 7, 17)>, \<5, (26, 24, 3)>, \<5, (7, 17, 24)\>
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<6, (27, 14, 25)>, \<6, (27, 25, 12)>, \<6, (14, 23, 6)>, \<6, (25, 12, 28)\>
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<8, (26, 19, 28)>, \<8, (26, 2, 11)>, \<8, (26, 19, 28)>, \<8, (2, 11, 16)\>
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<9, (26, 14, 19)>, \<9, (26, 19, 23)>, \<9, (26, 14, 6)>, \<9, (14, 23, 19)\>
9. Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<10, (29, 18, 13)\>
10. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<11, (2, 20, 4)>, \<11, (2, 16, 25)>, \<11, (4, 19, 28)>, \<11, (20, 25, 16)\>
11. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<13, (22, 10, 16)\>
12. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<14, (9, 6, 23)\>
13. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<15, (29, 28, 15)\>
14. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<16, (13, 2, 25)\>
15. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<17, (21, 5, 1)>, \<17, (21, 29, 1)>, \<17, (21, 29, 5)>, \<17, (29, 1, 5)\>
16. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<19, (9, 4, 23)>, \<19, (9, 8, 26)>, \<19, (9, 23, 4)>, \<19, (4, 28, 19)\>
17. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<21, (22, 1, 17)\>
18. Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<22, (13, 21, 1)\>
19. Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<23, (0, 14, 19)\>
20. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. \<24, (5, 3, 0)\>
21. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<25, (16, 25, 6)>, \<25, (16, 18, 25)>, \<25, (18, 12, 25)>, \<25, (16, 12, 25)\>
22. Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<26, (9, 5, 26)>, \<26, (9, 3, 26)>, \<26, (9, 8, 26)>, \<26, (3, 24, 26)\>
23. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<28, (15, 4, 12)>, \<28, (15, 8, 28)>, \<28, (15, 12, 6)>, \<28, (4, 17, 28)\>
24. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. \<29, (15, 10, 28)>, \<29, (15, 1, 17)>, \<29, (15, 28, 1)>, \<29, (10, 21, 29)\>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 58

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
