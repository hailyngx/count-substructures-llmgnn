Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 20) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 23) (8, 9) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 29) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 2) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 4) (25, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 10) (16, 5) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 18) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 22) (24, 5) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 7) (24, 1) (4, 14) (4, 25) (15, 6) (26, 25) (26, 29) (20, 27) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 26) (13, 7) (13, 16) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 21) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 28) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are 5, 9, 0, 27, 24, 2, 16, 6, 8, 23, 7, 12, 1, 25, 10, 29, 13, 18, 21, and 19.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom {3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom {3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 66\)

Therefore, there are 66 3-stars in total, and the answer is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (2, 12, 24)>, <9, (6, 8, 23)>, <27, (0, 22, 24)>, <24, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 11, 25)>, <16, (13, 18, 21)>, <6, (24, 7, 15)>, <23, (9, 6, 29)>, <7, (12, 24, 25)>, <1, (10, 19, 21)>
