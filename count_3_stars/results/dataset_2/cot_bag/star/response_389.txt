Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 4 neighbors each: nodes 4, 5, 2, and 8. 

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>

For node 2:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4+4+4+4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
