Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. We can calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars calculated for each node: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 78 \]

So, there are 78 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 12)>, <0, (8, 12, 13)>, <0, (10, 13, 14)>, <0, (8, 12, 13)>, <2, (4, 8, 13)>, <2, (10, 13, 14)>, <4, (1, 9, 13)>, <4, (2, 8, 13)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (3, 6, 12)>, <8, (0, 9, 12)>, <8, (0, 11, 14)>, <8, (11, 12, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 13)>, <11, (3, 7, 12)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [78].
