Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 12) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 17) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 12) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 10) (6, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 4) (9, 10) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 18, 19)>
<3, (0, 4, 17)>
<3, (0, 4, 14)>
<3, (0, 17, 14)>
<3, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (8, 2, 13)>
<3, (8, 2, 5)>
<3, (8, 5, 13)>
<3, (13, 2, 5)>
<3, (13, 5, 15)>
<3, (14, 8, 3)>
<3, (14, 8, 4)>
<3, (14, 3, 4)>
<3, (14, 4, 15)>
<3, (16, 10, 12)>
<4, (12, 2, 1, 16)>
<5, (5, 1, 2, 13, 15)>
<5, (12, 18, 2, 16, 10)>
<5, (12, 18, 10, 16, 2)>
<5, (12, 16, 2, 10, 6)>
<5, (16, 5, 10, 12, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
