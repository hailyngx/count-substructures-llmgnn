Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars and identify them:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (6, 0), (0, 3), (0, 2), forming 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (5, 1), (1, 7), (1, 2), forming 1 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (9, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), forming 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (9, 3), (6, 3), (4, 3), (8, 3), (0, 3), (3, 2), forming 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (9, 4), (7, 4), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 7), forming 1 3-star.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (0, 6), forming 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1), forming 1 3-star.
8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8), (6, 8), (8, 4), (8, 3), forming 1 3-star.
9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (3, 9), forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (6, 0, 3)>, <1, (5, 1, 7)>, <2, (9, 2, 1)>, <3, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (6, 7, 3)>, <7, (5, 7, 1)>, <8, (9, 8, 4)>, <9, (9, 8, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
