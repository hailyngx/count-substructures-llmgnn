Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 5 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 6 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 25

So, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<2, (8, 1, 5)>
<2, (8, 5, 1)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<2, (8, 3, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, 2)>
<3, (8, 6, 2)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (6, 2, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 2)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 2)>
<8, (2, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 1)>
<8, (3, 6, 2)>
<8, (3, 2, 6)>
