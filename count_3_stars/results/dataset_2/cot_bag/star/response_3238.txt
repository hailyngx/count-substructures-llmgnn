Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star and then count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0: (4, 0), (7, 0), (3, 0), (6, 0) - 4 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-star.

2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9), (1, 8) - 5 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-stars.

3. Node 2: (7, 2), (1, 2), (8, 2), (5, 2), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 9) - 9 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 9) - 3 neighbors, so there are [1] 3-star.

5. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (8, 4), (6, 4), (0, 4) - 7 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

6. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2) - 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

7. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 0), (5, 6), (0, 6) - 7 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

8. Node 7: (4, 7), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (2, 7), (0, 7) - 7 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

9. Node 8: (4, 8), (1, 8), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 8) - 7 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

10. Node 9: (1, 9), (3, 9), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2) - 7 neighbors, so there are [3] 3-stars.

Counting all the 3-stars gives us the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [18]
