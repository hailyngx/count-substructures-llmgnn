Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {11, 8, 5, 12}
- 1: {17, 15, 7}
- 2: {8, 7}
- 3: {5, 7}
- 4: {10, 13, 5}
- 5: {4, 0, 3, 7}
- 6: {14, 15, 19}
- 7: {17, 2, 1, 5, 3}
- 8: {11, 2, 0}
- 9: {18, 15}
- 10: {11, 4, 16}
- 11: {10, 0, 13, 8}
- 12: {17, 0}
- 13: {11, 18, 4}
- 14: {17, 6, 18}
- 15: {1, 9, 6}
- 16: {10, 19}
- 17: {14, 1, 12, 7}
- 18: {14, 9, 13}
- 19: {16, 6}

There are 12 nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: None form 3-stars.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 
  - Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
  - Node 17 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 = 14.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].

Unique 3-stars:
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 17)>
<7, (2, 1, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 17)>
<7, (3, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 17)>
<7, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 17)>
<7, (5, 2, 17)>
<7, (5, 3, 17)>
<17, (1, 14, 18)>
<17, (1, 15, 9)>
