Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

1. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 8, 4, 0
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>

2. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 10, 3
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 10)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 10)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 10, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 10)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 10, 3)>, <9, (4, 10, 3)>

3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 12, 14, 6
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 12)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 12, 14)>, <4, (5, 12, 6)>, <4, (5, 14, 6)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 12, 6)>, <4, (9, 14, 6)>, <4, (12, 14, 6)>

4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 10, 6, 11
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <12, (4, 10, 6)>, <12, (4, 10, 11)>, <12, (4, 6, 11)>, <12, (10, 6, 11)>

5. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 7, 12, 14, 4, 13
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <6, (7, 12, 14)>, <6, (7, 12, 4)>, <6, (7, 12, 13)>, <6, (7, 14, 4)>, <6, (7, 14, 13)>, <6, (7, 4, 13)>, <6, (12, 14, 4)>, <6, (12, 14, 13)>, <6, (12, 4, 13)>, <6, (14, 4, 13)>

6. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 9, 12, 3, 8, 1
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <10, (9, 12, 3)>, <10, (9, 12, 8)>, <10, (9, 12, 1)>, <10, (9, 3, 8)>, <10, (9, 3, 1)>, <10, (9, 8, 1)>, <10, (12, 3, 8)>, <10, (12, 3, 1)>, <10, (12, 8, 1)>, <10, (3, 8, 1)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54.

Therefore, the final answer is [54].
