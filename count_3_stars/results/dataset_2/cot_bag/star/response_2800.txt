Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 24) (0, 28) (0, 24) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 4) (5, 27) (6, 15) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (18, 24) (18, 7) (21, 20) (21, 10) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 25) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 1) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 16) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 15) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 27) (7, 18) (7, 22) (7, 10) (11, 26) (11, 8) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 29) (1, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 29) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 24) (2, 14) (2, 23) (2, 1) (15, 14) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 29) (25, 28) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node and see if it can form a 3-star. We'll only consider nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 8 has 2 neighbors, Node 11 has 2 neighbors, Node 13 has 3 neighbors, Node 14 has 4 neighbors, Node 15 has 4 neighbors, Node 16 has 5 neighbors, Node 19 has 3 neighbors, Node 20 has 3 neighbors, Node 21 has 3 neighbors, Node 22 has 3 neighbors, Node 23 has 4 neighbors, Node 24 has 5 neighbors, Node 26 has 3 neighbors, Node 27 has 3 neighbors, Node 28 has 3 neighbors, and Node 29 has 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 23, 28)>
<1, (2, 14, 15)>
<1, (2, 14, 29)>
<1, (2, 15, 29)>
<1, (23, 8, 26)>
<1, (23, 8, 11)>
<1, (23, 26, 11)>
<1, (23, 26, 8)>
<1, (14, 15, 29)>
<1, (23, 26, 24)>
<1, (23, 24, 0)>
<1, (23, 24, 16)>
<1, (14, 15, 6)>
<1, (14, 2, 27)>
