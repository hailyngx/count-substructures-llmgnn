Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (16, 29) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 22) (21, 29) (0, 1) (0, 24) (0, 4) (0, 8) (27, 2) (27, 9) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 12) (26, 1) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 24) (2, 17) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (28, 24) (28, 25) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 20) (9, 27) (9, 25) (5, 11) (5, 29) (5, 10) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 28) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 3) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 14) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 7) (14, 22) (14, 25) (14, 20) (7, 1) (7, 15) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 25) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 13) (29, 16) (29, 21) (29, 5) (18, 25) (13, 10) (13, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (12, 6) (12, 19)
