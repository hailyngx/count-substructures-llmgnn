Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 8) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 26) (6, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 25) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 25) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (23, 4) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 20) (28, 2) (28, 3) (28, 0) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 18) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 21) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 0) (20, 2) (20, 3) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 10) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 4) (16, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 11) (12, 15) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 15, 27, 6, 9, 18, 14, 17, 26, 5, 19, and 24. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 44 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [44].
