Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9, 12
- Node 1: 5, 8, 9, 2
- Node 2: 10, 11, 1, 3
- Node 3: 4, 10, 8, 14
- Node 4: 0, 7, 6, 9, 3
- Node 5: 10, 11, 8, 1
- Node 6: 4, 9, 8, 13
- Node 7: 4, 0, 11, 10
- Node 8: 6, 13, 5, 1, 3
- Node 9: 4, 6, 1, 0
- Node 10: 7, 11, 3, 13, 2
- Node 11: 7, 10, 5, 2
- Node 12: 0, 14
- Node 13: 6, 10, 8
- Node 14: 12, 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars. For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we have:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 1 forms 3-stars: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 2 forms 3-stars: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 5 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 6 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 7 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 8 forms 3-stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 10 forms 3-stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 11 forms 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 13 forms 3-stars: [3 choose 3] = 1

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 58

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (10, 11, 1)>
<3, (4, 10, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 6)>
<5, (10, 11, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<8, (6, 13, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>
<10, (7, 11, 5)>
<11, (7, 10, 3)>
<13, (6, 10, 8)>
