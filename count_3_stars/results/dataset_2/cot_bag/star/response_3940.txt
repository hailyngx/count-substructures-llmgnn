Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the 10 nodes and the list of edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 5, 4, 3, 8, 2, 9
So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 3, 8)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 3, 8)>, <0, (4, 3, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 6, 1, 0, 7
So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 6, 0
So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (7, 6, 0)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 10 + 10] = [40] \)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 3, 8)>, <0, (5, 3, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 3, 8)>, <0, (4, 3, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (7, 6, 0)>
