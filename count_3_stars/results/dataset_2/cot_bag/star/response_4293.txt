Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. Let's start by listing the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Connected to 5 neighbors
Node 1: Connected to 4 neighbors
Node 2: Connected to 4 neighbors
Node 3: Connected to 5 neighbors
Node 4: Connected to 4 neighbors
Node 6: Connected to 4 neighbors
Node 7: Connected to 4 neighbors
Node 8: Connected to 3 neighbors
Node 9: Connected to 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \).

Hence, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
