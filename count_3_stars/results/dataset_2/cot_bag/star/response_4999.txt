Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 0), (7, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 5), (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 0), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 5) 

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to three or more nodes:

Node 2: {6, 9, 1, 3, 4}

Node 3: {6, 9, 1, 7, 2, 5}

Node 4: {8, 0, 5, 2}

Node 5: {6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0}

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by summing up the combinations for each of these nodes:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 54 \]

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in this graph.

List of 3-stars:
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<1, (3, 2, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 2)> 

Putting all the unique 3-stars inside brackets gives: [ <2, (6, 9, 1)>, <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 5)>, <5, (6, 3, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <1, (3, 2, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 2)>]
