Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 17) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 10) (25, 16) (25, 28) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 14) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 17) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 10) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 9) (28, 25) (28, 26) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 24) (10, 20) (10, 0) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 27) (24, 9) (15, 26) (15, 23) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 23) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 26) (17, 6) (5, 3) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 15) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 21) (8, 27) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 23) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 24) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 11, 13, 10, 24. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 12, 29. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 13, 22, 7, 2. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 21, 23. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 11, 17, 23, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 13, 4, 20, 17. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 14, 19, 24. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 24, 0, 27, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 16, 22, 4, 0, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 29, 18, 9. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 22, 7, 26, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 29, 19, 14. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 18, 26, 9. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 20, 5, 23. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 15, 6, 5, 21. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 11, 12, 9, 27. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 19, 28, 15, 17. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 2, 14, 18. It forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 17 in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
