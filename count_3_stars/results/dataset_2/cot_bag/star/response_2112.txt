The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 22) (29, 26) (29, 15) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 17) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (21, 25) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 19) (22, 9) (17, 1) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 24) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 7) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 25) (25, 21) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 20) (14, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {4, 5, 16}
Node 1: {2, 13, 17}
Node 2: {1, 10, 14, 27}
Node 3: {6, 23, 28}
Node 4: {0, 12}
Node 5: {0, 6, 19}
Node 6: {3, 5, 11, 12, 21, 28}
Node 7: {8, 24}
Node 8: {7, 9, 13}
Node 9: {8, 22}
Node 10: {2, 26}
Node 11: {6, 15, 17}
Node 12: {4, 6, 24}
Node 13: {1, 8, 16}
Node 14: {2, 20}
Node 15: {11, 17, 25, 29}
Node 16: {0, 13, 24}
Node 17: {1, 11, 15, 26}
Node 18: {19, 21}
Node 19: {5, 18, 21, 22}
Node 20: {14, 27}
Node 21: {6, 18, 19, 22, 25, 28}
Node 22: {9, 19, 21, 28}
Node 23: {3, 23, 25, 27}
Node 24: {7, 12, 16}
Node 25: {15, 21, 23}
Node 26: {10, 17, 29}
Node 27: {2, 20, 23}
Node 28: {3, 6, 21, 22}
Node 29: {15, 26}

Let's now find the 3-stars and count their total in this graph.
