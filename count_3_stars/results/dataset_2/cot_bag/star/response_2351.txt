Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 10, and 11.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (9, 11, 13)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (0, 10, 11)>
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <10, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <11, (0, 3, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
