Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 13 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 10, 13 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 7, 9, 10, 14 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Node 5 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 9, 12, 14 -> \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 10, 14 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 10 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5 -> 1 3-star

Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 14 -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 13 -> 1 3-star

Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 10, 11 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 95 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [95].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 13, 5>, <2, 13, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 10>, <2, 13, 12>, <4, 14, 7>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 10, 7>, <4, 10, 14>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 9, 14>, <7, 0, 13>, <8, 1, 3>, <10, 2, 7>, <10, 2, 13>, <12, 3, 5>, <14, 5, 10>, <14, 7, 4>, <14, 11, 10>
