Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 80 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [80].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (6, 13, 1)>, <3, (9, 11, 4)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 13, 14)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <13, (6, 3, 1)>.
