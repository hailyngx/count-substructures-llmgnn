Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 16) (0, 27) (0, 9) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 21) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 19) (20, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 24) (22, 15) (22, 26) (22, 19) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 14) (11, 2) (11, 28) (28, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 18) (24, 27) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 17) (4, 6) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 10) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 5) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 12) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 6) (7, 9) (3, 14) (12, 20) (12, 23) (12, 21) (12, 9) (16, 27) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 9) (18, 28) (18, 1) (18, 21) (18, 13) (25, 15) (25, 5) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 18) (13, 18) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 3 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 3-stars
- Node 18: 3 3-stars
- Node 19: 3 3-stars
- Node 20: 3 3-stars
- Node 21: 2 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 3 3-stars
- Node 26: 2 3-stars
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 3 3-stars
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (27, 24, 16)>
<2, (11, 28, 8)>
<5, (19, 23, 10)>
<6, (16, 4, 17)>
<8, (2, 28, 24)>
<9, (12, 10, 13)>
<12, (21, 23, 20)>
<15, (25, 22, 28)>
<16, (10, 27, 6)>
<18, (21, 28, 1)>
<19, (20, 22, 5)>
<20, (12, 29, 21)>
<21, (12, 18, 29)>
<22, (19, 26, 15)>
<24, (8, 27, 26)>
<26, (14, 24, 3)>
<27, (0, 24, 16)>
<28, (11, 18, 8)>
<29, (2, 21, 20)>
