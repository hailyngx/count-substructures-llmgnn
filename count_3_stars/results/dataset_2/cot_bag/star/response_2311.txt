Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (12, 10) (12, 17) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (9, 17) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 11) (18, 1) (18, 0) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 0) (0, 18) (0, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three edges are: 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-star counts, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<15, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 11, 16)>
<7, (4, 16, 10)>
<10, (6, 12, 19)>
<11, (4, 5, 6)>
<13, (14, 15, 19)>
<14, (11, 13, 16)>
<16, (1, 4, 14)>
<17, (0, 12, 15)>
<19, (3, 10, 13)>
