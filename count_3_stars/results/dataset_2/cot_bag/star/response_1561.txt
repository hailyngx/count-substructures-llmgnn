Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 19) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 4) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 1
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 2
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
For nodes with degree greater than or equal to 3:
- For Node 0: [ ]
- For Node 2: [ ]
- For Node 3: [ <3, (6, 7, 19)> ]
- For Node 5: [ <5, (13, 16, 17)> ]
- For Node 6: [ <6, (3, 7, 15)>, <6, (4, 7, 15)> ]
- For Node 7: [ <7, (0, 6, 15)> ]
- For Node 8: [ ]
- For Node 9: [ ]
- For Node 15: [ ]
- For Node 16: [ <16, (1, 5, 15)> ]
- For Node 17: [ ]

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (6, 7, 19)>, <5, (13, 16, 17)>, <6, (3, 7, 15)>, <6, (4, 7, 15)>, <7, (0, 6, 15)>, <16, (1, 5, 15)>
