Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 14) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 0) (0, 22) (0, 24) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 11) (28, 21) (28, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 11) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 25) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (4, 28) (4, 13) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 3) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (8, 15) (8, 16) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 3) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 2) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 11) (19, 2) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 6) (14, 18) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 25) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 12) (25, 29) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 10) (10, 27) (10, 25) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors 
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 2 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 2 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors
- Node 20: 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 4 neighbors
- Node 23: 2 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 2 neighbors
- Node 27: 5 neighbors
- Node 28: 2 neighbors
- Node 29: 4 neighbors

Based on the number of neighbors, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form a 3-star.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form a 3-star.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors, there is only 1 way to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, there are a total of [50] unique 3-stars in this graph.
