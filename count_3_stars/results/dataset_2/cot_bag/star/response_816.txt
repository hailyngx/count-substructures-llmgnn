Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes. Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 8}

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph.
1. Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
3. Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
5. Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
7. Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
8. Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Summing them up:
10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
