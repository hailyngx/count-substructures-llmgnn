Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 10) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (9, 1, 15)>, <2, (3, 14, 9)>, <4, (0, 17, 10)>, <5, (16, 17, 18)>, <6, (3, 7, 11)>, <10, (2, 4, 7)>, <13, (8, 10, 14)>, <14, (3, 9, 13)>, <16, (5, 11, 19)>, <17, (1, 4, 6)>, <18, (1, 2, 5)>
