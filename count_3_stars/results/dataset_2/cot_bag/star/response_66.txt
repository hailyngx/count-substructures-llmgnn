Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
In this graph, Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8, 2), Node 2 has 5 neighbors (6, 1, 8, 5, 0), Node 3 has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 9, 1, 0), Node 5 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 2), Node 6 has 2 neighbors (9, 2), Node 8 has 5 neighbors (4, 9, 2, 5, 0), and Node 9 has 6 neighbors (7, 6, 8, 3, 1, 0).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 20 = 61 \]

So, the final count of 3-stars is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
