Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we have a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed per combination, so a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed per node.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed per node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: 
\( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

Hence, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in this graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
1. <3, (8, 19, 15)>
2. <4, (13, 14, 5)>
3. <7, (12, 9, 6)>
4. <8, (5, 13, 12)>
5. <12, (17, 16, 7)>
6. <13, (5, 8, 4)>
7. <15, (9, 19, 6)>
8. <16, (0, 10, 12)>
9. <19, (6, 3, 18)>
