Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 1) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 3) (4, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3, node 5, and node 13.

For node 3, there are 3 neighbors: nodes 15, 10, and 4. Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (15, 10, 4)>.

For node 5, there are 3 neighbors: nodes 6, 11, and 14. Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 11, 14)>.

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors: nodes 15, 12, 2, and 18. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center: <13, (15, 12, 2)>, <13, (15, 12, 18)>, <13, (15, 2, 18)>, <13, (12, 2, 18)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \).
