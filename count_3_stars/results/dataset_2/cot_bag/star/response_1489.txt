Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 11) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 12) (8, 15) (8, 5) (1, 16) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 7) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (6, 18, 19)>
<0, (7, 16, 17)>
<0, (7, 18, 19)>
<0, (16, 17, 1)>
<3, (5, 7, 15)>
<5, (3, 8, 15)>
<10, (2, 13, 14)>
<10, (5, 13, 15)>
<10, (5, 14, 15)>
<10, (13, 14, 18)>
<14, (10, 11, 13)>
<15, (5, 8, 10)>
<15, (8, 10, 11)>
<18, (0, 6, 19)>
