Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors 4, 5
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: neighbors 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: neighbors 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 2, 5, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:  
For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 6C3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 3C3 = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>
