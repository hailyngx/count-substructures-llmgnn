Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (can't form a 3-star).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (can't form a 3-star).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (can't form a 3-star).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (can't form a 3-star).
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors (can't form a 3-star).
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

Let's now list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 12)>, <0, (3, 8, 12)>, <0, (4, 8, 12)>, <0, (4, 11, 12)>, <0, (8, 11, 12)>, <1, (9, 10, 14)>, <3, (0, 8, 13)>, <3, (0, 12, 13)>, <4, (0, 8, 12)>, <4, (0, 11, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 11, 2)>, <4, (8, 11, 2)>, <11, (0, 8, 14)>, <11, (0, 12, 14)>.
