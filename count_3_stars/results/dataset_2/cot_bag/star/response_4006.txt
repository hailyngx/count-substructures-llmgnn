Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 17) (0, 2) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 21) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (26, 23) (26, 19) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 19) (4, 13) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 15) (24, 5) (24, 16) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 13) (14, 20) (14, 28) (14, 22) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 13) (15, 21) (15, 16) (9, 27) (9, 2) (9, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 21) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <8, (0, 2, 17)>
- <10, (7, 8, 18)>
- <12, (3, 21, 29)>
- <14, (20, 22, 28)>
- <16, (15, 21, 24)>
- <18, (10, 13, 23)>
- <19, (4, 26, 28)>
- <21, (6, 12, 15)>
- <22, (14, 20, 28)>
- <23, (1, 8, 26)>
- <27, (16, 20, 22)>
- <28, (14, 19, 22)>
- <29, (5, 12, 21)>
