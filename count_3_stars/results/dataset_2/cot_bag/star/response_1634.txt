Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 14) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 8) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 15 as the center.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 18 as the center.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 19 as the center.

Adding up the 3-stars for each node: 
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

Putting the final number inside brackets: [45].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 16, 10)>, <0, (16, 18, 5)>, <1, (3, 19, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 10)>, <5, (9, 18, 1)>, <6, (2, 19, 1)>, <13, (6, 11, 15)>, <14, (8, 13, 12)>, <15, (16, 18, 17)>, <18, (2, 5, 15)>
