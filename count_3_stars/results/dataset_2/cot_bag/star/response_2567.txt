Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighboring nodes are listed below:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now we'll count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 80

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 80.
