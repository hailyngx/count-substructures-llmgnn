Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 10)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (6, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 13)>, <6, (4, 5, 13)>, <7, (5, 6, 13)>, <8, (0, 1, 10)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <10, (0, 1, 8)>, <11, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (4, 6, 7)>, <13, (5, 6, 7)>, <14, (4, 9, 1)>.
