Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed with it:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (5, 7, 6, 2) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 2, 8) => only 1 3-star
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (9, 1, 6, 8, 0) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (5, 4, 7, 6, 2) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (9, 1, 3) => only 1 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (9, 0, 3) => only 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (9, 3, 2, 8, 0) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (9, 0, 3) => only 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (9, 1, 6, 2) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (5, 9, 6, 8, 4) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 42. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (5, 7, 6)>
- <2, (9, 1, 0)>
- <2, (9, 3, 6)>
- <2, (9, 6, 8)>
- <2, (9, 6, 0)>
- <2, (9, 8, 0)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (4, 7, 0)>
- <3, (4, 7, 2)>
- <3, (7, 0, 6)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <6, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (9, 8, 0)>
- <6, (3, 2, 8)>
- <6, (3, 6, 0)>
- <8, (9, 1, 6)>
- <8, (9, 6, 2)>
- <8, (9, 2, 0)>
- <8, (1, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
- <9, (6, 8, 0)>
