Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors along with the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (3-stars: [1])
Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [4])
Node 3: 5 neighbors (3-stars: [10])
Node 4: 3 neighbors (3-stars: [1])
Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [4])
Node 6: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [4])
Node 7: 5 neighbors (3-stars: [10])
Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-stars: [10])
Node 9: 4 neighbors (3-stars: [4])

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
