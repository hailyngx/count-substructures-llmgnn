Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has neighbors {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: has neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: has neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: has neighbors {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: has neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: has neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7, 8)>
