Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 13) (20, 4) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (12, 25) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 9) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 11) (22, 3) (22, 26) (22, 29) (11, 26) (4, 20) (4, 19) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 0) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 10) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 7) (19, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 0) (5, 21) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 10) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 17) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 23) (14, 12) (14, 15) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 29) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 20: 2 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 5 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 29: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (13, 2, 29)>, 
<1, (26, 5, 0)>, 
<2, (5, 23, 0)>, 
<3, (25, 22, 18)>, 
<5, (21, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (21, 6, 29)>, 
<8, (24, 15, 10)>, 
<12, (25, 27, 14)>, 
<13, (20, 8, 0)>, 
<15, (21, 16, 14)>, 
<17, (24, 2, 23)>, 
<24, (12, 8, 17)>, 
<25, (3, 16, 15)>, 
<26, (1, 22, 11)>, 
<29, (7, 22, 0)>.
