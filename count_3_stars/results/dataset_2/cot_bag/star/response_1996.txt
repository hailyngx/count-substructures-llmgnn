Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 16) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 17) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (16, 14) (16, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 12
- Node 2: 4, 12, 13, 15
- Node 3: 10, 11, 17, 18
- Node 4: 2, 9, 16, 18
- Node 5: 6, 7, 12, 13
- Node 6: 5, 15, 18
- Node 7: 0, 5, 14
- Node 8: 0, 9, 13
- Node 9: 4, 8
- Node 10: 3, 14
- Node 11: 3, 18, 19
- Node 12: 1, 2, 5, 15
- Node 13: 2, 5, 8
- Node 14: 7, 10, 16
- Node 15: 2, 6, 12
- Node 16: 4, 14
- Node 17: 3, 19
- Node 18: 3, 4, 6, 11
- Node 19: 11, 17

By examining the nodes, we find that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19. 

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 12, 15)>, <2, (4, 12, 1)>, <2, (13, 5, 12)>, <2, (13, 8, 5)>, <3, (10, 14, 17)>, <3, (10, 14, 11)>, <3, (17, 11, 19)>, <4, (9, 8, 16)>, <4, (18, 6, 15)>, <4, (18, 11, 3)>, <4, (18, 4, 16)>, <5, (6, 15, 12)>, <5, (7, 0, 14)>, <5, (7, 13, 5)>, <5, (13, 2, 12)>, <7, (5, 13, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <12, (1, 2, 15)>, <14, (7, 10, 16)>, <18, (6, 11, 3)>, <18, (6, 4, 16)>, <18, (6, 4, 2)>, <18, (11, 3, 19)>.
