Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors = 1, 4, 2. No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Neighbors = 9, 6, 4, 0, 8. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <1, (9, 6, 4)>.
- Node 2: Neighbors = 5, 4, 6, 0, 7. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 4, 6)>.
- Node 3: Neighbors = 7, 6, 4, 8. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <3, (7, 6, 4)>.
- Node 4: Neighbors = 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, 2. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <4, (9, 1, 3)>.
- Node 5: Neighbors = 9, 2. No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = 1, 3, 2. No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors = 3, 8, 2. No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Neighbors = 9, 1, 3, 4, 7. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <8, (9, 1, 4)>.
- Node 9: Neighbors = 5, 8, 4, 1. Total 3-stars = 1. Unique 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 4)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars found (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) gives 5 3-stars in total. Therefore, the answer is [5].
