Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
We'll first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 6 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 \times 2 + 4 \times 3 + 1 \times 2 = 24 \)

Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 13, 14)>
<1, (0, 8, 14)>
<2, (7, 9, 13)>
<3, (7, 9, 13)>
<4, (0, 8, 12)>
<8, (0, 1, 14)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<13, (0, 1, 7)>
