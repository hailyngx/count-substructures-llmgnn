Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 5, 9, 8, 13, 10, 11, 0, 7, and 1. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 9: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 8: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 13: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 10: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 11: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 0: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

For node 1: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes that have three or more neighbors: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 62 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62], and the unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 8, 13)>, <10, (8, 11, 2)>, <8, (5, 13, 7)>, <13, (9, 8, 0)>, <11, (8, 10, 14)>, <0, (5, 13, 7)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>, <1, (11, 0, 7)>.
