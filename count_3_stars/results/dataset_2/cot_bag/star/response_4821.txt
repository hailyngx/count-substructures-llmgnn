Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
In this case, the nodes contributing to the number of 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 13.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we get:
\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 74 \)

So, there are a total of [74] unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 11, 13)>
- <1, (0, 11, 13)>
- <1, (10, 13, 14)>
- <1, (11, 0, 4)>
- <1, (11, 10, 0)>
- <1, (11, 4, 9)>
- <2, (6, 12, 14)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
  
- <4, (0, 11, 13)>
- <4, (9, 11, 13)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 13)>
- <6, (1, 0, 13)>
- <6, (1, 2, 12)>
- <6, (1, 12, 2)>
  
- <6, (2, 1, 12)>
- <7, (3, 8, 10)>
- <8, (3, 7, 10)>
- <8, (7, 3, 10)>

- <10, (3, 7, 8)>
- <11, (0, 1, 13)>
- <11, (1, 0, 13)>
- <11, (1, 4, 9)>
- <11, (1, 10, 0)>
- <11, (4, 1, 9)>
  
- <12, (6, 2, 14)>
- <13, (0, 1, 11)>
- <13, (0, 4, 6)>
- <13, (0, 6, 4)>
- <13, (1, 0, 11)>
- <13, (1, 4, 9)>
- <13, (1, 11, 0)>
