Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 64 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 64.  
Therefore, the final answer is [64].  
Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 3, 10)>  
<1, (0, 3, 9)>  
<2, (6, 9, 13)>  
<3, (1, 2, 13)>  
<4, (0, 7, 8)>  
<5, (7, 9, 14)>  
<6, (2, 9, 13)>  
<7, (4, 5, 9)>  
<9, (1, 7, 13)>  
<10, (0, 1, 13)>  
<13, (2, 6, 9)>
