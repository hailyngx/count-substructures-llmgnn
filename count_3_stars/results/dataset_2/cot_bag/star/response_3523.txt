Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (15, 8) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (14, 11) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 7)

- Unique 3-stars for node 0: <0, (6, 8, 3)>, <0, (6, 8, 18)>, <0, (6, 3, 18)>, <0, (8, 3, 18)>

For node 1:
- Nodes connected to node 1: 9, 7, 11

- Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (9, 10, 0)>

For node 7:
- Nodes connected to node 7: 4, 2, 1, 17
- Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 7: <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 17)>, <7, (4, 1, 17)>, <7, (2, 1, 17)>

For node 8:
- Nodes connected to node 8: 2, 19, 15, 0, 18
- Number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 9:
- Nodes connected to node 9: 6, 18, 17, 16, 1
- Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 9: 
<9, (6, 18, 17)>, <9, (6, 18, 16)>, <9, (6, 17, 16)>, <9, (18, 17, 16)>, <9, (18, 17, 1)>, 
<9, (18, 16, 1)>, <9, (17, 16, 1)>, <9, (17, 16, 6)>, <9, (16, 1, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 17)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 41 \)

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

<2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 8, 12)>, <2, (7, 8, 12)>,
