Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors 
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get:
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 69 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [69], and the unique 3-stars found are:
