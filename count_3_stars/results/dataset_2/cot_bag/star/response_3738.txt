Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 13) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 9) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (15, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
After analyzing the given information, we can identify that nodes 0, 1, 5, 14, 16, 17, and 18 have 4 or more neighbors, making them potentially central nodes of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these central nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors (14, 18, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   
2. Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors (17, 6, 4, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 5: Node 5 has 4 neighbors (17, 12, 18, 16), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 14: Node 14 has 3 neighbors (17, 0, 15), so it can form 1 3-star.

5. Node 16: Node 16 has 4 neighbors (17, 3, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. Node 17: Node 17 has 4 neighbors (14, 1, 16, 5), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

7. Node 18: Node 18 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 19, 13), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these central nodes, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 22 3-stars. Thus, the final count is [22].

The unique 3-stars that can be formed are as follows:
<0, (14, 18, 8)>
<0, (14, 18, 9)>
<0, (18, 8, 19)>
<1, (17, 6, 4)>

<5, (17, 12, 16)>
<5, (17, 5, 12)>
<5, (12, 4, 2)>
<14, (17, 0, 15)>
<16, (17, 3, 9)>
<16, (17, 5, 16)>
<16, (5, 18, 16)>
<16, (5, 16, 9)>
<17, (1, 16, 6)>
<17, (1, 6, 11)>
<17, (1, 4, 12)>
<18, (0, 8, 19)>
<18, (0, 9, 19)>
<18, (5, 19, 13)>
