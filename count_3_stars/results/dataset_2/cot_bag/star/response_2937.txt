Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 9) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 3) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 11, 16), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7, 17), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 2, 13), (3, 13, 18), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 15), (5, 9, 15), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 5, 15), (6, 17, 14), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 1, 16), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 6, 12), (9, 7, 12), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (10, 15, 13), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (12, 9, 13), (12, 14, 18), so it forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (13, 10, 12), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (15, 5, 10), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (16, 11, 7), (16, 0, 15), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (17, 6, 12), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (18, 3, 13), (18, 5, 12), so it forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (19, 1, 3), so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows: <0, 11, 16>, <1, 7, 17>, <3, 2, 13>, <5, 6, 15>, <6, 14, 17>, <7, 1, 16>, <9, 6, 12>, <10, 13, 15>, <12, 13, 9>, <12, 14, 18>, <13, 10, 12>, <15, 5, 10>, <16, 11, 7>, <17, 6, 12>, <18, 3, 13>.
