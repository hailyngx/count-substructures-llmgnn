Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 13) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 2) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (13)
- Node 1: (11, 16, 7)
- Node 2: (6, 8, 19, 13, 4)
- Node 3: (14)
- Node 4: (17, 11, 2)
- Node 5: (6, 10, 16)
- Node 6: (5, 9, 2, 12)
- Node 7: (1, 17, 11, 14, 18)
- Node 8: (2, 15, 12)
- Node 9: (6, 10)
- Node 10: (5, 9, 13)
- Node 11: (1, 7, 4)
- Node 12: (6, 8)
- Node 13: (10, 17, 2, 0, 18)
- Node 14: (3, 7, 15)
- Node 15: (8, 16, 19, 14)
- Node 16: (5, 1, 15)
- Node 17: (13, 4, 7)
- Node 18: (13, 7)
- Node 19: (2, 15)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1, Node 7, and Node 11 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 \)
- Node 2, Node 6, Node 13, and Node 15 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \)
- Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 40.
Thus, the answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (11, 7, 4)>
<2, (6, 8, 12)>
<2, (6, 13, 17)>
<2, (8, 15, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 16)>
<7, (1, 17, 11)>
<7, (14, 15, 18)>
<13, (10, 17, 2)>
<15, (8, 16, 19)>
