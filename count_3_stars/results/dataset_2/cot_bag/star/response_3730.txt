Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 7) (1, 23) (1, 0) (1, 27) (3, 5) (3, 13) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 18) (25, 11) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 25) (18, 24) (18, 8) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (29, 27) (29, 8) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 26) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 27) (16, 4) (16, 2) (7, 9) (7, 26) (7, 15) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 8) (24, 18) (24, 2) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 2) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 0) (14, 20) (14, 19) (14, 6) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 6) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 27) (23, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 1, 20, 25, 18, 21, 28, 17, 22, 26, 10, 15, 13, 8, 19, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (3, 11, 17)>
<9, (7, 20, 28)>
<1, (0, 23, 27)>
<20, (9, 22, 25)>
<25, (18, 20, 22)>
<18, (8, 24, 25)>
<21, (0, 13, 28)>
<28, (9, 19, 21)>
<17, (0, 2, 13)>
<22, (20, 25, 26)>
<26, (6, 7, 22)>
<15, (7, 10, 12)>
<13, (3, 4, 17)>
<8, (11, 18, 29)>
<19, (8, 14, 27)>
<7, (9, 15, 26)>
