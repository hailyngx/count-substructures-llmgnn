Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 6, 9, 11, 0, 1, 3, 12, 2, 8, 14, 5, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 86

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 11, 14)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 11)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (10, 11, 13)>, <6, (10, 12, 13)>, <6, (10, 12, 14)>, <6, (11, 13, 5)>, <6, (12, 14, 0)>, <6, (12, 14, 5)>, <9, (0, 12, 14)>, <9, (2, 12, 14)>
