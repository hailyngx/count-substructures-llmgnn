Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes, we will examine each node that has at least 3 neighbors.

Let's first write down the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 2, 9
- Node 2: neighbors 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: neighbors 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: neighbors 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 41 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 4)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (8, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].
