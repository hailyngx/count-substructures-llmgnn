Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 8) (3, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with fewer than 3 neighbors, so we can ignore those nodes for the purpose of finding 3-stars. 

Let's list the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 5: (9, 13, 4)  
Node 9: (5, 15, 17, 1, 7)  
Node 4: (5, 18)  
Node 7: (9, 0)  
Node 18: (4, 15, 12, 17, 8)  
Node 13: (5, 17, 2, 3)  
Node 0: (7)  
Node 1: (9, 6, 14)  
Node 15: (9, 18, 6)  
Node 17: (9, 18, 13)  
Node 6: (1, 15, 2, 12, 16)  
Node 12: (18, 6, 16, 19)  
Node 16: (10, 6, 12, 8)  
Node 2: (13, 6, 11, 14)  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 1 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)  
So, there are a total of 50 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the final answer in brackets is  [50].

List of unique 3-stars:

<9, (5, 15, 17)>  
<13, (5, 17, 2)>  
<1, (9, 6, 14)>  
<15, (9, 18, 6)>  
<17, (9, 18, 13)>  
<6, (1, 15, 2)>  
<6, (12, 16, 8)>  
<6, (2, 11, 14)>  
 <12, (18, 6, 16)>
