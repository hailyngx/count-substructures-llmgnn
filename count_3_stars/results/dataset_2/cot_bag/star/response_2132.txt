Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 16) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{20}{3} = 1140 \) possible 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the given edges:

For node 0: Node 0 has 2 neighbors (6, 19). Thus, there are no 3-stars formed with node 0.

For node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors (8, 13, 3). So, there is 1 3-star: <2, (8, 13, 3)>.

For node 4: Node 4 has 4 neighbors (5, 12, 11, 15). So, there are 4 3-stars: <4, (5, 12, 11)>, <4, (5, 12, 15)>, <4, (5, 11, 15)>, <4, (12, 11, 15)>.

For node 6: Node 6 has 4 neighbors (18, 19, 7, 0). So, there are 4 3-stars: <6, (18, 19, 7)>, <6, (18, 19, 0)>, <6, (18, 7, 0)>, <6, (19, 7, 0)>.

For node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (5, 14, 2, 19). So, there are 4 3-stars: <8, (5, 14, 2)>, <8, (5, 14, 19)>, <8, (5, 2, 19)>, <8, (14, 2, 19)>.

For node 11: Node 11 has 5 neighbors (17, 4, 15, 7, 13). So, there are 10 3-stars: <11, (17, 4, 15)>, <11, (17, 4, 7)>, <11, (17, 4, 13)>, <11, (17, 15, 7)>, <11, (17, 15, 13)>, <11, (17, 7, 13)>, <11, (4, 15, 7)>, <11, (4, 15, 13)>, <11, (4, 7, 13)>, <11, (15, 7, 13)>.

For node 12: Node 12 has 4 neighbors (14, 4, 15, 19). So, there are 4 3-stars: <12, (14, 4, 15)>, <12, (14, 4, 19)>, <12, (14, 15, 19)>, <12, (4, 15, 19)>.

For node 13: Node 13 has 3 neighbors (9, 2, 11). So, there is 1 3-star: <13, (9, 2, 11)>.

For node 15: Node 15 has 4 neighbors (17, 4, 12, 11). So, there are 4 3-stars: <15, (17, 4, 12)>, <15, (17, 4, 11)>, <15, (17, 12, 11)>, <15, (4, 12, 11)>.

For node 16: Node 16 has 2 neighbors (18, 10). Thus, there are no 3-stars formed with node 16.

For node 17: Node 17 has 4 neighbors (3, 15, 11, 7). So, there are 4 3-stars: <17, (3, 15, 11)>, <17, (3, 15, 7)>, <17, (3, 11, 7)>, <17, (15, 11, 7)>.

For node 18: Node 18 has 3 neighbors (14, 16, 6). So, there is 1 3-star: <18, (14, 16, 6)>.

For node 19: Node 19 has 4 neighbors (8, 6, 0, 12). So, there are 4 3-stars: <19, (8, 6, 0)>, <19, (8, 6, 12)>, <19, (8, 0, 12)>, <19, (6, 0, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1+4+4+4+10+4+4+1+4+4+1+4 = 45.

Thus, the final answer is [45].
