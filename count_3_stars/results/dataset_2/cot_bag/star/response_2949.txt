Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 13) (26, 10) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 23) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 21) (17, 1) (17, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 5) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 23) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 8) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 25) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 8) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 25) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 22) (19, 5) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 12) (16, 4) (24, 7) (24, 25) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 12) (28, 4) (28, 14) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (3, 6) (3, 23) (8, 17) (8, 21) (8, 1) (8, 29) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 6, 13, 14, 20, 22, 23, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 9, 27, 6, and 15. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
2. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 3, and 15. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 26, 29, 1, and 23. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 22, 28, 10, and 21. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 18, 29, and 10. So, there is 1 3-star.
6. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 19, and 5. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 7, 13, 11, 3, and 12. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 13, 20, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 28 \) 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 9, 15>, <6, 3, 6, 15>, <13, 1, 13, 23>, <14, 10, 14, 21>, <20, 10, 20, 29>, <22, 9, 22, 14>, <23, 3, 23, 7>, <23, 3, 23, 12>, <23, 7, 23, 11>, <23, 12, 23, 13>
