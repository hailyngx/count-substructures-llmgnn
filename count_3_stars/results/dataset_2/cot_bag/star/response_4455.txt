Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13
- Node 2: neighbors 0, 4, 8, 14
- Node 5: neighbors 6, 12, 13
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 5, 8, 13
- Node 7: neighbors 9, 12, 14, 8
- Node 9: neighbors 1, 3, 7, 10, 14
- Node 10: neighbors 0, 11, 9, 14
- Node 11: neighbors 8, 10, 12, 13
- Node 12: neighbors 1, 5, 7, 11, 13
- Node 13: neighbors 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 81 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [81].
