Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has neighbors 3, 4, 8, and 19; it can form 4 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has neighbors 1, 18, and 19; it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 7 has neighbors 6, 11, 15, and 18; it can form 4 3-stars.
4. Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, 12, and 15; it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 12 has neighbors 6, 8, and 16; it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 15 has neighbors 7, 8, and 17; it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 16 has neighbors 2, 12, and 6; it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 18 has neighbors 3, 5, 7, and 9; it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 19 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 10, and 11; it can form 5 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node gives us a total of 21 3-stars. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (3, 4, 19)>
<1, (3, 8, 19)>
