Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 4) (17, 21) (15, 14) (15, 21) (20, 7) (20, 1) (20, 22) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 5) (7, 20) (12, 29) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 8) (10, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 22) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 27) (25, 0) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 22) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 4) (2, 26) (2, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 27) (3, 27) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 19) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 19) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 14) (23, 6) (21, 17) (21, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 14, 15)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 20, 8)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 17, 6)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 8, 4)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 1, 5)
- Node 11: 1 3-star (11, 24, 29)
- Node 14: 1 3-star (14, 15, 23)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (16, 9, 3)
- Node 20: 1 3-star (20, 1, 22)
- Node 22: 1 3-star (22, 3, 25)
- Node 24: 1 3-star (24, 11, 6)
- Node 25: 1 3-star (25, 22, 0)
- Node 26: 1 3-star (26, 11, 2)
- Node 27: 1 3-star (27, 29, 3)
- Node 28: 1 3-star (28, 11, 26)
- Node 29: 1 3-star (29, 25, 27)

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars in total, and the list of unique 3-stars found is: <0, 14, 15>, <1, 20, 8>, <4, 17, 6>, <5, 8, 4>, <11, 24, 29>, <14, 15, 23>, <16, 9, 3>, <20, 1, 22>, <22, 3, 25>, <24, 11, 6>, <25, 22, 0>, <26, 11, 2>, <27, 29, 3>, <28, 11, 26>, <29, 25, 27>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
