Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 18) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 15) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 13) (16, 15) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 3, 11>
<3, 0, 11>
<3, 4, 18>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 18, 2>
<4, 0, 14>
<4, 12, 15>
<4, 14, 1>
<5, 6, 11>
<5, 11, 15>
<5, 15, 8>
<5, 19, 17>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 2, 18>
<9, 6, 3>
<9, 10, 11>
<9, 17, 19>
<10, 9, 11>
<10, 11, 5>
<13, 7, 8>
<13, 8, 15>
