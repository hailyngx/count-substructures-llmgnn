Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 13, 7
2. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 10, 11, 7, 6
3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 9, 14, 11
4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 1, 12, 9
5. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 7, 6, 11, 3, 12
6. Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 4, 6, 9, 5, 14, 12
7. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 5, 11, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:  
1. Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 68 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 4, 13>  
<1, 7, 13>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 6, 11>  
<4, 7, 13>  
<6, 9, 11>  
<7, 9, 12>  
<7, 11, 13>  
<9, 11, 12>  
<4, 11, 14>  
<6, 11, 14>  
<9, 11, 14>  
<14, 11, 12>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
