Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph, such as nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (9, 2, 10)>
<1, (3, 2, 10)>
<1, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (3, 10, 11)>

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (9, 1, 10)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<2, (1, 3, 10)>
<2, (1, 10, 11)>
<2, (1, 10, 5)>
<2, (10, 11, 5)>
<2, (10, 8, 12)>
<2, (10, 5, 0)>
<2, (11, 5, 0)>
<2, (5, 11, 8)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 13, 9)>
<3, (7, 0, 14)>
<3, (13, 9, 14)>

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (10, 11, 0)>
<5, (10, 12, 0)>
<5, (10, 2, 0)>
<5, (10, 2, 8)>
<5, (11, 12, 0)>
<5, (11, 2, 8)>
<5, (12, 0, 14)>
<5, (2, 0, 14)>
<5, (2, 8, 12)>
<5, (8, 12, 0)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (11, 4, 7)>
<6, (11, 7, 12)>
<6, (11, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 12, 0)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (6, 12, 0)>
<7, (6, 3, 0)>
<7, (6, 11, 12)>
<7, (3, 0, 14)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (10, 11, 12)>
<8, (10, 12, 5)>
<8, (10, 2, 5)>
<8, (12, 7, 5)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (1, 13, 14)>
<9, (1, 14, 0)>
<9, (13, 14, 0)>
<9, (13, 14, 2)>

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<10, (1, 11, 8)>
<10, (1, 11, 5)>
<10, (1, 2, 8)>
<10, (1, 2, 5)>
<10, (11, 8, 12)>
<10, (11, 5, 0)>
<10, (2, 8, 12)>
<10, (2, 5, 0)>
<10, (8, 12, 0)>
<10, (8, 5, 0)>

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<11, (10, 5, 8)>
<11, (10, 8, 12)>
<11, (5, 8, 12)>
<11, (8, 12, 0)>

For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<12, (6, 7, 0)>
<12, (6, 8, 7)>
<12, (6, 10, 8)>
<12, (7, 0, 5)>
<12, (10, 8, 5)>
<12, (10, 5, 0)>
<12, (8, 7, 5)>
<12, (8, 2, 5)>
<12, (13, 14, 0)>
<12, (2, 5, 0)>

For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<13, (9, 14, 0)>
<13, (9, 14, 2)>
<13, (9, 1, 14)>
<13, (14, 0, 5)>

Adding up the 3-stars from all nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 60 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [60].
