Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 115

Therefore, the final answer is [115].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (12, 13, 14)>
<1, (4, 13, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 10)>
<6, (8, 12, 0)>
<9, (3, 11, 14)>
<10, (3, 12, 6)>
<12, (4, 13, 11)>
<13, (4, 7, 5)>
