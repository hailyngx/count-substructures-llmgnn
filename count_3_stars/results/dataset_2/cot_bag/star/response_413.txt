Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of the nodes, we find:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4

We have 5 nodes with degree 5 or more: nodes 2, 6, and 8 with degree 5, and nodes 1 and 4 with degree 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, with degree 5, contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <2, (5, 0, 6)>
  - <2, (5, 1, 4)>
  - <2, (6, 1, 3)>
  - <2, (6, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 8, 5)>
  - <2, (6, 3, 1)>
  - <2, (2, 5, 4)>
  - <2, (2, 1, 6)>

- Node 6, with degree 5, contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <6, (5, 0, 2)>
  - <6, (5, 1, 3)>
  - <6, (2, 1, 4)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 2)>
  - <6, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <6, (1, 3, 2)>
  - <6, (6, 8, 4)>
  - <6, (6, 2, 1)>

- Node 8, with degree 5, contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <8, (9, 4, 2)>
  - <8, (7, 4, 1)>
  - <8, (7, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (9, 4, 2)>
  - <8, (7, 9, 4)>
  - <8, (7, 1, 6)>
  - <8, (8, 6, 2)>
  - <8, (8, 2, 1)>
  - <8, (8, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (8, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].
