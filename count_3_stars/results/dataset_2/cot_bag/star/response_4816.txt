Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 19) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (14, 9) (14, 15) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, namely nodes 4, 9, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

For node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars are: <4, (18, 3, 16)>, <4, (18, 13, 16)>, <4, (3, 13, 16)>, <4, (18, 3, 13)>.

For node 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars are: <9, (13, 6, 8)>, <9, (13, 6, 14)>, <9, (13, 8, 14)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <9, (6, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 8, 13)>, <9, (4, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 8, 14)>, <9, (8, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 6, 13)>.

For node 13: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars are: <13, (9, 6, 5)>, <13, (9, 6, 16)>, <13, (9, 5, 16)>, <13, (6, 5, 16)>, <13, (6, 9, 16)>, <13, (4, 5, 9)>, <13, (4, 9, 16)>, <13, (4, 5, 16)>, <13, (5, 9, 16)>, <13, (4, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 10] = 24.
