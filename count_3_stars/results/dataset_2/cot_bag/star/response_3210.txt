Response:
First, let's represent this graph visually to better understand its structure.

The graph consists of 20 nodes labeled from 0 to 19. The edges are represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 16, 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 15.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 11, 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 13, 14, 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 12, 13, 16.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 17, 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9, 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 14.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 10.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 0.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29 \), which can be written as [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 9, 19>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <3, 9, 13>
- <3, 9, 16>
- <3, 11, 19>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <5, 9, 16>
- <5, 9, 18>
- <9, 13, 18>
- <9, 16, 0>
- <9, 16, 4>
- <9, 16, 13>
- <9, 16, 19>
- <10, 13, 18>
- <10, 17, 5>
- <10, 17, 18>
- <12, 3, 4>
- <13, 18, 10>
- <13, 18, 5>
- <13, 18, 9>
- <13, 18, 10>
- <13, 18, 5>
- <13, 18, 9>
- <14, 15, 2>
- <15, 2, 8>
- <16, 9, 3>
- <16, 9, 13>
- <19, 1, 7>
