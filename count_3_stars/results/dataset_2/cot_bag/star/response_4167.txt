Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 10 and node 15. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 10:
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 16, 17, 7, 5.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 15:
Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 17.
So, the number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <10, (16, 17, 7)>, and <15, (1, 6, 17)>.
