Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 6) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 12) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 12) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 14, 15, 18, 11, 9, 2, 12, 16, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 43 3-stars.

So, there are [43] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<14, (11, 9, 19)>
<15, (10, 18, 12)>
<18, (10, 6, 1)>
