Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 6) (1, 14) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 18) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 5) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 8) (17, 2) (17, 23) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 14) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 29) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 7) (5, 26) (5, 11) (5, 20) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 18) (8, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 22) (22, 19) (22, 24) (3, 6) (3, 7) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 22) (16, 18) (16, 4) (25, 9) (25, 10) (29, 21) (29, 27) (29, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 8) 

Response:
There are a couple of things to note in the graph: 

1. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
2. Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 6 3-stars.
4. Node 27, 18, 2, 21, 4, 7, 12, 5, 14, and 10 each have 3 neighbors and therefore can form 1 3-star each.

Adding up all these possibilities gives us a total of 4 + 6 + 6 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 36 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [36].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
