Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 15) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 3) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\binom{5}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 35 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 65
\]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [65].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 3, 14)>, <3, (9, 4, 11)>, <4, (5, 15, 19)>, <5, (4, 7, 12)>, <6, (1, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 10, 17)>, <9, (0, 11, 15)>, <11, (3, 9, 17)>, <12, (5, 6, 16)>, <14, (0, 18, 19)>, <15, (2, 4, 9)>, <16, (2, 12, 17)>, <17, (7, 11, 16)>, <19, (4, 14, 5)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
