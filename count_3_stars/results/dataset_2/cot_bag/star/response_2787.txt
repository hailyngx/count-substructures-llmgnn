Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 13) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 12) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (12, 10) (19, 15) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 6) (8, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (7, 9) (7, 15) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 1
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 1

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 18, 1)>
<3, (0, 3, 10)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (16, 17, 5)>
<6, (17, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 8, 10)>
<9, (13, 9, 4)>
<10, (15, 10, 8)>
<13, (14, 16, 13)>
<15, (7, 15, 9)>
<16, (5, 11, 16)>
<17, (0, 13, 17)>
<18, (3, 18, 4)>
