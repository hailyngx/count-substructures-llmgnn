Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 19) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 18) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (28, 11) (28, 16) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 13) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 5) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 2) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 1) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 23) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 10) (21, 24) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 0) (24, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 27) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 24) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 19) (13, 26) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars taking into consideration the number of neighbors for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 3 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 6 3-stars
- Node 20: 3 3-stars
- Node 23: 3 3-stars
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in this graph. 

<0, (9, 20, 29)>, <1, (12, 14, 29)>, <2, (9, 11, 14)>, <4, (11, 1, 27)>, <7, (11, 18, 23)>, <9, (0, 20, 29)>, <10, (21, 18, 22)>, <11, (4, 7, 28)>, <12, (1, 14, 17)>, <14, (1, 12, 29)>, <16, (2, 11, 28)>, <18, (7, 10, 24)>, <20, (9, 1, 23)>, <23, (7, 20, 25)>, <25, (2, 23, 27)>, <26, (13, 17, 25)>, <27, (1, 4, 5)>, <28, (2, 11, 16)>, <29, (14, 20, 0)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
