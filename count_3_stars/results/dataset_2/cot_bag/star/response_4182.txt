Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 5, 9, 4, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 48 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>.
