Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
By examining the given information, we can draw the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges as described. 

The nodes and their connections are:

- Node 0 connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1 connected to nodes 5, 6, 11
- Node 2 connected to nodes 4, 6, 8
- Node 3 connected to nodes 0, 8, 9, 13
- Node 4 connected to nodes 2, 5, 12, 14
- Node 5 connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 6 connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 10, 12
- Node 7 connected to nodes 0, 9, 14
- Node 8 connected to nodes 2, 3, 10, 11, 13
- Node 9 connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 12, 13
- Node 10 connected to nodes 6, 8
- Node 11 connected to nodes 1, 8, 12, 13, 14
- Node 12 connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 13 connected to nodes 3, 8, 9, 11
- Node 14 connected to nodes 4, 7, 11, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 doesn't form any 3-star as it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 doesn't form any 3-star as it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 2 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 12)>, <3, (8, 9, 13)>, <4, (2, 5, 14)>, <6, (1, 5, 12)>, <6, (2, 5, 10)>, <8, (3, 11, 13)>, <9, (0, 12, 13)>, <12, (4, 6, 11)>, <12, (6, 9, 14)>, <13, (3, 9, 11)>, <14, (4, 11, 12)>, <14, (7, 11, 12)>
