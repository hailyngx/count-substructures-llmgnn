Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].
