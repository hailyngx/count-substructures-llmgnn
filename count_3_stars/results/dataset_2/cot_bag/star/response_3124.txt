Now, we will find the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
