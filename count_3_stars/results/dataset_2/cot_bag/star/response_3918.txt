Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (1, 21) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 12) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 16) (9, 21) (9, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (20, 29) (20, 3) (2, 8) (2, 28) (2, 25) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 7) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 22) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (28, 11) (28, 2) (28, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 23) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 7) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 24) (27, 29) (27, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 18) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 22) (5, 15) (5, 28) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (0, 11) (0, 1) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 22) (18, 16) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 24) (23, 19) (23, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 10, node 12, node 13, and node 18. 

For node 10, there is 1 unique 3-star <10, (15, 16, 18)>.

For node 12, there are 3 unique 3-stars: <12, (4, 18, 29)>, <12, (21, 29, 3)>, and <12, (18, 24, 29)>.

For node 13, there is 1 unique 3-star <13, (7, 8, 19)>.

For node 18, there are 3 unique 3-stars: <18, (4, 10, 12)>, <18, (12, 16, 29)>, and <18, (18, 22, 24)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
