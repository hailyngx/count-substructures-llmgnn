Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 9), (3, 2)

Now, let's analyze each node with its neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to 3 neighbors (9, 4, 8). Total 3-stars: [1]
    <0, (9, 4, 8)>

- Node 1: Connected to 5 neighbors (5, 4, 6, 2, 8). Total 3-stars: [10]
    <1, (5, 4, 6)>
    <1, (5, 4, 8)>
    <1, (5, 6, 2)>
    <1, (9, 4, 6)>
    <1, (9, 4, 8)>
    <1, (9, 4, 6)>
    <1, (4, 6, 8)>
    <1, (4, 7, 2)>
    <1, (6, 7, 2)>
    <1, (6, 7, 2)>

- Node 2: Connected to 4 neighbors (5, 7, 1, 3). Total 3-stars: [4]
    <2, (5, 7, 3)>
    <2, (5, 7, 3)>
    <2, (5, 1, 3)>
    <2, (7, 1, 3)>

- Node 3: Connected to 2 neighbors (9, 2). Total 3-stars: [0]

- Node 4: Connected to 5 neighbors (9, 7, 0, 1, 6). Total 3-stars: [10]
    <4, (9, 7, 0)>
    <4, (9, 7, 1)>
    <4, (9, 7, 6)>
    <4, (9, 0, 1)>
    <4, (7, 0, 1)>
    <4, (7, 0, 6)>
    <4, (0, 1, 6)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>

- Node 5: Connected to 5 neighbors (9, 6, 2, 8, 1). Total 3-stars: [10]
    <5, (9, 6, 2)>
    <5, (9, 6, 8)>
    <5, (9, 6, 1)>
    <5, (6, 2, 8)>
    <5, (6, 2, 1)>
    <5, (6, 8, 1)>
    <5, (6, 8, 1)>
    <5, (2, 8, 1)>
    <5, (2, 8, 1)>
    <5, (2, 8, 1)>

- Node 6: Connected to 4 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 7). Total 3-stars: [4]
    <6, (5, 9, 4)>
    <6, (5, 9, 4)>
    <6, (5, 9, 4)>
    <6, (9, 4, 7)>

- Node 7: Connected to 3 neighbors (4, 6, 2). Total 3-stars: [1]
    <7, (4, 6, 2)>

- Node 8: Connected to 3 neighbors (5, 0, 1). Total 3-stars: [1]
    <8, (5, 0, 1)>

- Node 9: Connected to 5 neighbors (5, 6, 4, 3, 0). Total 3-stars: [10]
    <9, (5, 6, 3)>
    <9, (5, 4, 3)>
    <9, (5, 4, 0)>
    <9, (5, 4, 6)>
    <9, (5, 4, 7)>
    <9, (5, 4, 7)>
    <9, (4, 6, 3)>
    <9, (4, 6, 3)>
    <9, (4, 6, 7)>
    <9, (4, 0, 7)>

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 0, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 3)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, 6, 8>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 0, 7>
