Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 0) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 19) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 13, 15
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 13, 17
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 18, 3
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 1, 12, 14, 16
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 17, 19
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 13, 14
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 13

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (2, 6, 13)>
  - <3, (2, 13, 15)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 15)>
  - <3, (6, 13, 15)>

- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <14, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <14, (5, 7, 13)>
  - <14, (5, 7, 17)>
  - <14, (5, 9, 13)>
  - <14, (5, 9, 17)>
  - <14, (5, 13, 17)>
  - <14, (7, 9, 13)>
  - <14, (7, 9, 17)>
  - <14, (7, 13, 17)>
  - <14, (9, 13, 17)>

- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <15, (4, 8, 18)>
  - <15, (4, 8, 3)>
  - <15, (4, 18, 3)>
  - <15, (8, 18, 3)>

- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <17, (1, 12, 14)>
  - <17, (1, 12, 16)>
  - <17, (1, 14, 16)>
  - <17, (12, 14, 16)>

- For node 1: Only 1 3-star <1, (5, 17, 19)>

- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (1, 13, 14)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 14)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 13)>
  - <5, (6, 13, 14)>

- For node 19: Only 1 3-star <19, (0, 13, 1)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [28] \)
