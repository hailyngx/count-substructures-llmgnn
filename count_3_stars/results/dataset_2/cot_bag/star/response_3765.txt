Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 23) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 22) (18, 27) (12, 24) (27, 18) (27, 23) (10, 26) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 13) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 25) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (5, 23) (5, 25) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 26) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 6) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 21) (2, 15) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 6) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 0) (21, 8) (21, 16) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 14) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 22) (0, 16) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 9) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 14) (24, 12) (24, 20) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 29) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3, node 15, node 4, and node 22. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 15:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 22:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (15, 2, 13)>
<15, (3, 26, 14)>
<15, (3, 13, 14)>
<15, (2, 13, 14)>
<15, (26, 13, 10)>
<15, (2, 26, 14)>
<15, (26, 13, 2)>
<4, (23, 29, 17)>
<22, (18, 2, 29)>
<22, (18, 27, 2)>
<22, (18, 29, 2)>
<22, (18, 27, 29)>
<15, (26, 13, 2)>
<22, (18, 29, 2)>
<22, (27, 18, 2)>
<22, (22, 27, 29)>
