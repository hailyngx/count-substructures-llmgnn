Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
The five nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 8, 9, 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 8, 0. Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 10, 8, 19, 16. Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 15, 12, 3. Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 17, 10, 3, 17. Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 9, 15, 2, 5. Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (10, 8, 19)>
<8, (4, 5, 15)>
<9, (6, 17, 10)>
<10, (9, 15, 2)>
