Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 8), (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0), (0, 8), (0, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes according to the description provided earlier:

Node 1: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
<1, (7, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 1)>, <1, (8, 2, 1)>, <1, (7, 1, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 1)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 1, 1)>

Node 4: inom(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
<4, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 4)>, <4, (7, 6, 4)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>

Node 5: inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star
<5, (9, 1, 2)>

Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
<6, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <6, (7, 3, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 1, 6)>, <6, (7, 6, 0)>

Node 7: inom(6, 3) = 20 3-stars
<7, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 7, 6)>, <7, (4, 7, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 7, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 7)>, <7, (6, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 3, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 7)>, <7, (6, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 7, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (8, 1, 7)>

Node 8: inom(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
<8, (9, 7, 8)>, <8, (7, 1, 8)>, <8, (7, 6, 8)>, <8, (7, 8, 2)>, <8, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 8, 0)>, <8, (6, 8, 2)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 9: inom(6, 3) = 20 3-stars
<9, (5, 2, 9)>, <9, (5, 1, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 1, 9)>, <9, (8, 4, 9)>, <9, (8, 7, 9)>, <9, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 9, 8)>, <9, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (7, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (9, 7, 4)>, <9, (9, 7, 6)>, <9, (9, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20] = [75]

Unique 3-stars: <<5, (9, 1, 2)>, <1, (7, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 1)>, <1, (8, 2, 1)>, <1, (7, 1, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 1)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 1, 1)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 4)>, <4, (7, 6, 4)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>, <6, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 6, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <6, (7, 3, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 1, 6)>, <6, (7, 6, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 7, 6)>, <7, (4, 7, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 7, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 7)>, <7, (6, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 3, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 7)>, <7, (6, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 7, 0)>, <8, (9, 7, 8)>, <8, (7, 1, 8)>, <8, (7, 6, 8)>, <8, (7, 8, 2)>, <8, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 8, 0)>, <8, (6, 8, 2)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 2, 9)>, <9, (5, 1, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 1, 9)>, <9, (8, 4, 9)>, <9, (8, 7, 9)>, <9, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 9, 8)>, <9, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (7, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (9, 7, 4)>, <9, (9, 7, 6)>, <9, (9, 4, 6)>>
