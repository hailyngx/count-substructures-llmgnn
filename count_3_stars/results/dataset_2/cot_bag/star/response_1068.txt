Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 1:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
For node 8:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>
