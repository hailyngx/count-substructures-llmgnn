Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree at least 3) so we can find the total number of 3-stars formed.  

The nodes with degree at least 3 are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. 

For node 0, there are 0 3-stars.  
For node 1, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 2, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 4, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 5, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 7, there are  inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  
For node 8, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 9, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 10, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 12, there are  inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  
For node 13, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 16, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 17, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 18, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 20, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 23, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 25, there are  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.  
For node 27, there are  inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.  
For node 29, there are  inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the 3-stars formed with each node:  
Total: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, 4, 13>  
<2, 1, 23>  
<4, 1, 13>  
<5, 7, 13>  
<7, 5, 16>  
<8, 7, 29>  
<9, 8, 15>  
<10, 17, 20>  
<12, 14, 27>  
<16, 20, 25>  
<29, 6, 7>  
<29, 6, 0>
