Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 or more, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars. 

The degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4

From this, we see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have a degree of 3 or more.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<0, (2, 1, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 3)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (9, 3, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 1)>
<7, (1, 9, 4)>
<8, (4, 0, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 6)>
