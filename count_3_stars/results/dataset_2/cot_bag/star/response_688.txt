Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars up, we get a total of \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [49] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 0, 14>
- <1, 8, 13>
- <1, 8, 14>
- <1, 9, 10>
- <10, 13, 15>
- <10, 13, 19>
- <10, 1, 8>
- <10, 1, 14>
- <12, 8, 14>
- <13, 10, 15>
- <13, 15, 14>
- <14, 1, 10>
- <14, 15, 19>
- <15, 2, 18>
- <15, 13, 10>
- <17, 6, 11>
- <17, 7, 10>
- <18, 2, 15>
- <18, 11, 6>
- <19, 10, 13>
