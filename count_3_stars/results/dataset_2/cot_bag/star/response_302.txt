Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
The central nodes that have three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 1, 0, 2, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For node 5: 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 9: 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 4: 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 7: 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 6: 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 8: 
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 61 \).
So, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 4)>, <4, (9, 1, 7)>, <7, (5, 1, 6)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <1, (9, 8, 3)>, <0, (7, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>.
