Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (22, 12, 27, 18, 6). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (13, 18, 21). So, it can form 1 3-star.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (29, 5, 28, 15). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 29 has 2 neighbors: (2, 16). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (9, 28, 25). So, it can form 1 3-star.

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (11, 9). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (11, 21, 1, 16). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (7, 10, 12, 20). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (2, 26, 14). So, it can form 1 3-star.

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (29, 10, 20, 17). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: (22, 10, 3, 27). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: (15, 0, 19, 5). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (2, 14, 26, 24). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (4, 7, 24). So, it can form 1 3-star.

- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: (13, 19, 21, 17). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (13, 11, 1, 25). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
