Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 13) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (11, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 9) (2, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 16) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 15) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} =  \sum_{v \in V} \binom{d(v)}{3} \]

Where:
- \(V\) is the set of nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18}.
- \(d(v)\) is the degree of node \(v\), i.e., the number of neighbors of node \(v\).

By substituting the degrees of the nodes, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} =  \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]
\[ = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 \]
\[ = 66 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 66.

Therefore, \([66]\) = [66].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (12, 14, 19)>, <1, (4, 16, 18)>, <3, (7, 11, 18)>, <4, (1, 13, 16)>, <7, (5, 10, 12)>, <9, (2, 15, 16)>
