Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 11) (3, 7) (25, 6) (25, 15) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 17) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 16) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 14) (20, 16) (9, 22) (9, 7) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 21) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 19) (21, 26) (21, 17) (21, 24) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 28) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 16) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 18) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 9) (23, 5) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 11) (24, 29) (24, 27) (24, 21) (24, 17) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 5) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 24) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 20) (16, 19) (16, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3}  \]

Calculating the above expression will give us the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph.
