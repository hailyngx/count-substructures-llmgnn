Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (3, 25) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 11) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 9) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 17) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 24) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 19) (17, 18) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 22) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 8) (8, 25) (8, 16) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (11, 25) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 29) (23, 5) (23, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (26, 10) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 16) (24, 19) (29, 7) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 10) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 23) (14, 22) (12, 15) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 1) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 1) (4, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are as follows:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 13, 23
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 9, 18, 22
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 20, 25, 6
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 12, 13, 20, 24
Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 0, 18, 20, 22, 16
Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 7, 11, 13, 24, 28
Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 4, 10, 18, 29
Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 2, 17, 14
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 16, 19, 20, 15
Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 11, 13
Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 11, 21

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 19 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 21 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 22 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 24 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 25 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 29 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].
