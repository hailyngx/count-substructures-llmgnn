Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 28) (22, 2) (3, 24) (3, 16) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 26) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 25) (10, 21) (10, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 29) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 21) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 9) (2, 22) (2, 14) (2, 11) (6, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 5) (23, 29) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 28) (20, 24) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 20) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 56 \)

Thus, there are 56 3-stars in this graph. So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [56]. 

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<15, 12, 24>
<27, 15, 21>
<7, 4, 18>
<28, 7, 20>
<18, 14, 16>
<21, 28, 20>
<13, 1, 8>
<25, 14, 9>
<21, 16, 3>
<23, 1, 5>
<29, 5, 23>
