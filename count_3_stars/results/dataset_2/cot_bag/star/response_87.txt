Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 19) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 10) (4, 21) (4, 26) (5, 25) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 27) (17, 13) (17, 23) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (22, 9) (22, 12) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 15) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 1) (28, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 28) (7, 0) (7, 1) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 18) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 19) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 20) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 19) (24, 2) (24, 9) (24, 11) (24, 20) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 20) (23, 4) (23, 17) (1, 28) (1, 7) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 27) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 26) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (20, 14) (20, 24) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 20) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 20) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 8, 23, 10, 21, 26, 10
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 22, 18, 28, 24
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 22, 16, 10, 19
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 17, 25, 14, 17
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 13, 11, 27, 20
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 14, 24, 18, 21, 10
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 2, 9, 11, 20
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 4, 28, 15
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 9, 26, 1, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{k}{3} \)
  - For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - For node 26: There are only 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
  - For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50

Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [50].
