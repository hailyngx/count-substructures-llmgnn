Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 17) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 12) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than 3 neighbors in this graph - nodes 5, 6, 4, 9, 14, 10, 0, 11, 12, 2, 13, and 3. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the given graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 5: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 6: 3-stars = [4]
  - <6, (5, 11, 12)>
  - <6, (5, 11, 15)>
  - <6, (5, 12, 15)>
  - <6, (11, 12, 15)>
- Node 4: 3-stars = [1]
  - <4, (9, 14, 0)>
- Node 9: 3-stars = [0]
- Node 14: 3-stars = [2]
  - <14, (0, 4, 13)>
  - <14, (0, 16, 13)>
- Node 10: 3-stars = [2]
  - <10, (0, 8, 16)>
  - <10, (0, 12, 16)>
- Node 0: 3-stars = [3]
  - <0, (10, 14, 13)>
  - <0, (10, 14, 16)>
  - <0, (13, 14, 16)>
- Node 11: 3-stars = [1]
  - <11, (5, 6, 18)>
- Node 12: 3-stars = [2]
  - <12, (5, 6, 17)>
  - <12, (6, 10, 17)>
- Node 2: 3-stars = [1]
  - <2, (0, 3, 19)>
- Node 13: 3-stars = [1]
  - <13, (0, 3, 14)>
- Node 3: 3-stars = [2]
  - <3, (2, 13, 18)>
  - <3, (2, 13, 3)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 20

So, the final answer is [20].
