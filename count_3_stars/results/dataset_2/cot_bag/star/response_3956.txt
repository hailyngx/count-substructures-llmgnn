Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 4) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 7) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 0) (29, 17) (4, 21) (4, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 24) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 25) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 22) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 3) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 23) (25, 28) (25, 15) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 27) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (22, 10) (8, 17) (8, 20) (20, 8) (20, 27) (2, 0) (2, 13) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 1) (27, 16) (27, 20) (27, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 11) (3, 26) (3, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:

1: {6, 19, 12, 27}
21: {28, 6, 4}
6: {1, 21, 7}
9: {10}
0: {14, 29, 2}
14: {0, 22, 12, 15}
17: {29, 16, 26, 8, 11}
29: {0, 17}
4: {21, 13}
18: {19, 15, 24}
28: {21, 7, 25}
24: {18, 26, 22}
26: {17, 24, 10, 3}
7: {6, 28, 23}
25: {28, 15}
10: {9, 26, 22, 5}
12: {1, 14, 16}
16: {17, 19, 12, 23, 27}
15: {14, 18, 25}
22: {14, 24, 10}
8: {17, 20}
20: {8, 27}
2: {0, 13}
23: {7, 16, 3}
13: {4, 2, 11}
27: {1, 16, 20, 5}
11: {17, 13, 5}
5: {10, 27, 11}
3: {26, 23}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 21: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For node 17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing these up, we get [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 34.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 19, 12)>
<1, (6, 19, 27)>
<1, (6, 12, 27)>
<1, (19, 12, 27)>
<17, (29, 16, 26)>
<17, (29, 16, 8)>
<17, (29, 26, 8)>
<17, (16, 26, 8)>
<14, (22, 12, 15)>
<16, (19, 12, 23)>
<16, (19, 12, 27)>
<16, (19, 23, 27)>
<16, (12, 23, 27)>
<27, (20, 5, 11)>
