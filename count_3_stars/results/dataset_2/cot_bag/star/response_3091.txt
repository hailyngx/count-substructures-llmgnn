This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can visualize the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 12, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 11, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 11, 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 11, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 10, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 12, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 13, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 0, 2.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 8, 14, 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 9, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 6, 11, 2, 10.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with them.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 contributes [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 11 contributes [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 68.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<0, (3, 4, 12)>
<0, (6, 4, 12)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (9, 11, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 11)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 11, 12)>
<5, (10, 13, 14)>
<6, (4, 12, 14)>
<7, (8, 10, 13)>
<8, (7, 11, 14)>
<9, (0, 13, 14)>
<10, (5, 13, 14)>
<11, (2, 11, 14)>
<13, (5, 9, 14)>
<14, (6, 11, 14)>
<14, (10, 11, 13)>
