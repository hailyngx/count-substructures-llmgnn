Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 19) (4, 12) (18, 14) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 11) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

Node 0: 16, 17
Node 1: 3, 6, 14, 5, 16
Node 2: 15, 9, 6, 11
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 4: 12
Node 5: 15, 1, 13, 17
Node 6: 1, 2, 10
Node 7: 12, 11, 17
Node 8: 15, 14, 10
Node 9: 3, 2, 19
Node 10: 8, 16, 6
Node 11: 7, 2, 14, 19
Node 12: 7, 4, 17, 19
Node 13: 5
Node 14: 1, 18, 8, 11
Node 15: 8, 5, 2
Node 16: 1, 0, 10
Node 17: 7, 5, 0, 12
Node 18: 14
Node 19: 12, 11, 9

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 16, 17>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 9, 15>
<5, 1, 13>
<6, 1, 10>
<7, 12, 17>
<8, 14, 15>
<9, 2, 19>
<10, 6, 16>
<11, 7, 14>
<12, 4, 17>
<14, 1, 18>
<15, 2, 8>
<17, 0, 5>
<19, 11, 12>
