Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \). 

So, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (9, 5, 1)>
- <5, (4, 8, 6)>
- <6, (4, 5, 1)>
- <1, (4, 6, 0)>
- <0, (8, 6, 1)>
- <3, (5, 6, 0)>
- <9, (4, 0, 1)>
