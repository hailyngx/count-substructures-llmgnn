Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the following 3-star graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 6), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 6)

Now we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 56 = 116

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [116], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>
