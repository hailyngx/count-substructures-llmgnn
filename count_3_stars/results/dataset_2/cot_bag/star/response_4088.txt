Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are 5 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 11, 13), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- For node 1, there are 4 neighbors (9, 10, 12, 14), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- For node 2, there are 3 neighbors (0, 4, 13), so there is only 1 3-star with node 2.
- For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 14), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- For node 4, there are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 11), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- For node 5, there are 5 neighbors (3, 9, 10, 13, 14), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- For node 6, there are 5 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 12, 13), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- For node 7, there are 4 neighbors (3, 6, 8, 14), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- For node 9, there are 4 neighbors (1, 5, 13, 14), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.
- For node 13, there are 6 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 14), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 13.
- For node 14, there are 5 neighbors (1, 5, 9, 13, 3), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes that have three or more neighbors, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [83]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 11)>, <0, (2, 13, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 6)>, <0, (4, 13, 2)>, <0, (4, 13, 6)>,
<1, (9, 10, 14)>, 
<3, (5, 9, 14)>, <3, (5, 13, 14)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 11)>, <4, (2, 0, 13)>, <4, (6, 8, 12)>, <4, (6, 13, 2)>,
<5, (3, 9, 14)>, 
<6, (4, 8, 12)>, <6, (4, 13, 2)>, <6, (7, 8, 12)>,
<7, (3, 6, 14)>, 
<9, (1, 13, 14)>, 
<13, (0, 2, 6)>, <13, (2, 5, 6)>, <13, (2, 6, 9)>, <13, (5, 6, 14)>,
