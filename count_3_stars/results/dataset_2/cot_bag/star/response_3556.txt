Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (17, 6) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 5) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 7) (14, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 18) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 18) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:
