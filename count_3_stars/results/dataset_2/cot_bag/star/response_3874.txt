Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the possible 3-stars together, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
