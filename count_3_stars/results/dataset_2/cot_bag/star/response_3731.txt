Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 92

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [92].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 11>, <0, 2, 13>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 11, 1>, <1, 11, 7>, <1, 11, 4>, <1, 11, 0>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 12, 8>, <2, 12, 4>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 7, 13>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 11, 1>, <4, 11, 7>, <4, 11, 0>, <4, 12, 2>, <4, 12, 8>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 12, 10>, <4, 13, 2>, <4, 13, 7>, <4, 13, 5>, <4, 14, 3>, <4, 14, 7>, <4, 14, 13>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 0>, <6, 10, 1>, <6, 10, 12>, <6, 10, 13>, <6, 10, 8>, <7, 11, 1>, <7, 11, 4>, <7, 11, 0>, <7, 13, 2>, <7, 13, 4>, <7, 14, 3>, <7, 14, 4>, <8, 10, 1>, <8, 10, 3>, <8, 12, 2>, <8, 12, 4>, <9, 10, 6>
