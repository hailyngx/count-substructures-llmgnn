Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 19) (2, 0) (2, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 10, 11, 8, 13, 4, 18, 1, 17, 0, 7, 15, 19, and 14. 

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5:
- Degree = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <5, (8, 1, 17)>, <5, (8, 0, 17)>, <5, (1, 17, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>

For node 10:
- Degree = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- 3-stars: <10, (11, 15, 4)>

For node 11:
- Degree = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- 3-stars: <11, (10, 19, 13)>

For nodes 8, 13, 4, 18, 1, 17, 0, 7, 15, 19, and 14:
- Degree = 3 for each
- Number of 3-stars = 1 for each
- Only one 3-star can be formed with these nodes.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 11 = 17

So, there are [17] 3-stars in this graph.
