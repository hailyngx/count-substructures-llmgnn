Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 26) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (10, 1) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 25) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 28) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 25) (25, 13) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 24) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (14, 3) (14, 9) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 17) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 16) (26, 3) (26, 0) (26, 7) (26, 17) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 14) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 17) (21, 27) (21, 4) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (29, 11) (29, 16) (17, 0) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.   
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars for these nodes gives:  
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

So, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<2, (8, 19, 28)>
<4, (6, 12, 21)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<9, (13, 25, 27)>
<12, (5, 6, 4)>
<13, (9, 25, 27)>
<16, (1, 8, 29)>
<17, (0, 7, 26)>
<19, (2, 22, 24)>
<20, (0, 27, 25)>
<22, (2, 24, 19)>
<24, (11, 22, 19)>
<25, (13, 20, 9)>
<26, (3, 7, 17)>
<27, (13, 9, 25)>
<28, (2, 17, 25)>
<17, (0, 28, 26)>
