Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 8) (5, 17) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
This complete graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges.  
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17  
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 10, 16  
Now, we'll count the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 44  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
