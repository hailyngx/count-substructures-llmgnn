Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 14, 3, 2
- Node 1: 7, 13, 14
- Node 2: 8, 13, 6, 0, 3
- Node 3: 9, 7, 13, 0, 2
- Node 4: 8, 14
- Node 5: 6, 13, 12, 11
- Node 6: 5, 8, 10, 2, 11
- Node 7: 0, 3, 10, 14, 1
- Node 8: 4, 2, 6, 12
- Node 9: 11, 3
- Node 10: 7, 6, 14
- Node 11: 5, 9, 6, 12
- Node 12: 5, 8, 13, 11
- Node 13: 5, 12, 2, 3, 1
- Node 14: 4, 7, 0, 1, 10
  
By checking each node, we find that only nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars following the formula mentioned earlier.

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37 \)
So, the final answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (6, 12, 13)>
- <6, (5, 11, 8)>
- <7, (0, 10, 14)>
- <8, (4, 6, 12)>
- <11, (5, 6, 12)>
- <12, (5, 8, 11)>
- <13, (5, 2, 3)>
