Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Go through each node with three or more neighbors and calculate \( inom{n}{3} \) for that node.
2. Sum up these calculations to find the total number of 3-stars.

For the given graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, there are [60] 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
