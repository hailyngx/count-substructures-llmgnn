Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 4, 2}
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 7}
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {6, 1, 3, 4, 0}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {6, 1, 7, 2}
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 1, 0, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [48]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (8, 7, 1)>
<1, (8, 7, 3)>
<1, (8, 1, 7)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<1, (7, 2, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<3, (6, 7, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
Keep in mind that the actual number of 3-stars might be different due to the possibility of overlapping nodes in different 3-stars.
