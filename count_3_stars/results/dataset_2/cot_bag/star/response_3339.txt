Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 0) (29, 15) (29, 22) (29, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 20) (6, 23) (6, 5) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 14) (12, 17) (12, 21) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 17) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 28) (14, 0) (14, 22) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 19) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 24) (26, 18) (19, 25) (19, 18) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 21) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 20) (3, 13) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 17) (15, 29) (15, 4) (15, 17) (13, 3) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 3) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 23) (10, 29) (10, 27) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 15) (21, 12) (21, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed and then sum them up.

1. For node 0: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. For node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. For node 2: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. For node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. For node 4: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. For node 5: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. For node 6: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. For node 7: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. For node 8: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. For node 9: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
11. For node 10: 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
12. For node 11: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. For node 14: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. For node 15: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
15. For node 17: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
16. For node 18: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17. For node 20: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18. For node 22: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
19. For node 23: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
20. For node 24: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
21. For node 25: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
22. For node 27: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
23. For node 28: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
24. For node 29: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them all up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
