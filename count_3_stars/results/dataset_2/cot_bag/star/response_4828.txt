Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (5, 17) (5, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 16) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 17, 8, 16, 10, 18, 15, 13, 11, 12, and 4. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, hence 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, hence 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, hence 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, hence 10 3-stars are formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, hence 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 35, and they can be uniquely represented as: <6, (7, 15, 8)>, <9, (18, 15, 11)>, <17, (5, 13, 3)>, <8, (6, 19, 11)>, <10, (19, 7, 4)>, <18, (9, 12, 3)>, <15, (6, 19, 12)>, <13, (17, 12, 2)>, <11, (9, 8, 4)>.
