Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 6, 4, 7, 10, 1, 11, 0, 12, 14, 2, 3, 5, and 13. For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

1. Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
2. Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
3. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
10. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
11. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these up gives us 120 3-stars in the graph, corresponding to the total number of 3-stars as [120].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<6, (9, 14, 12)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<10, (7, 11, 0)>
<1, (7, 10, 3)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<0, (6, 10, 3)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
<2, (11, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<5, (4, 1, 2)>
<13, (6, 9, 14)>
