Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors (7, 3, 6, 14, 9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (7, 3, 13, 8)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (6, 8, 14)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 10, 9, 0)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (10, 12, 14)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (7, 6, 13, 14)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (5, 2, 8, 0)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 11, 8, 5, 1)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (7, 1, 6, 2, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (3, 11, 8, 0, 13)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (4, 3, 12)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (7, 9, 13)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (4, 10, 13)
- Node 13: 5 neighbors (1, 11, 5, 12, 9)
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (4, 5, 2, 0, 13)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 14)>
<0, (3, 9, 13)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 13)>
<5, (7, 13, 14)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (1, 7, 13)>
<9, (0, 3, 13)>
<13, (1, 9, 11)>
<13, (5, 9, 13)>
<13, (9, 11, 13)>
<14, (0, 5, 13)>
