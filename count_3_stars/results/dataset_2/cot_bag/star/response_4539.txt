Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can now determine the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars that exist in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 3, 8)>

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8]
