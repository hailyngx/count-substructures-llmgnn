Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Now, we will determine the unique 3-stars formed in this graph:

For node 0: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. 
For node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 4: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 5: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 6: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 9: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (3, 2, 6)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>, <0, (3, 2, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
