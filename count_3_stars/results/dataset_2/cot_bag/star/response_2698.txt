Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 6
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Therefore, the nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For nodes 6 and 9, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 92 \).

So, there are a total of 92 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [92]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<6, (0, 7, 11)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<10, (2, 4, 14)>
<11, (0, 8, 13)>
<12, (1, 4, 9)>
<13, (0, 8, 9)>
<14, (2, 10, 11)>
<2, (6, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 12)>
<9, (1, 12, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
