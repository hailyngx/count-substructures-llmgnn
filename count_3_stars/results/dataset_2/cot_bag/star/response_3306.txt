Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 3, 11, 2
Node 1: 8, 11, 13, 10
Node 2: 7, 12, 13, 0
Node 3: 5, 4, 11, 0, 14
Node 4: 5, 7, 14, 3
Node 5: 9, 13, 4, 3, 10
Node 7: 9, 4, 2, 13
Node 8: 14, 10, 1
Node 9: 5, 11, 10, 7, 13
Node 10: 5, 9, 8, 1, 14
Node 11: 9, 12, 3, 1, 0
Node 12: 2, 14, 11
Node 13: 5, 9, 7, 2, 1
Node 14: 4, 8, 12, 3, 10

Nodes 6 and 15 do not have any neighbors in this graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 4, 14)>
<5, (3, 4, 10)>
<7, (9, 4, 13)>
<9, (5, 10, 13)>
<10, (5, 9, 14)>
<11, (9, 3, 1)>
<13, (5, 9, 1)>
