Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (15, 16) (15, 0) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 15) (0, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 16) (9, 19) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 11, 16, 3, 14, 7, 12, 5, 10, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41].

The unique 3-stars are: <11, (16, 14, 19)>, <16, (11, 15, 9)>, <7, (16, 12, 5)>, <12, (14, 18, 7)>, <5, (7, 12, 0)>, <10, (8, 19, 6)>.
