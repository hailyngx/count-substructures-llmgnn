Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the information provided.

Node 0 is connected to: 4, 1, 3, 8, 12, 10  
Node 1 is connected to: 3, 6, 11, 5, 10, 0  
Node 2 is connected to: 12, 5, 6, 11  
Node 3 is connected to: 1, 0, 14, 8  
Node 4 is connected to: 7, 8, 9, 0  
Node 5 is connected to: 1, 13, 2, 14  
Node 6 is connected to: 1, 2, 14  
Node 7 is connected to: 4, 12, 14  
Node 8 is connected to: 4, 3, 0  
Node 9 is connected to: 4, 13, 10  
Node 10 is connected to: 1, 13, 0, 9, 14  
Node 11 is connected to: 1, 13, 2  
Node 12 is connected to: 7, 2, 0  
Node 13 is connected to: 5, 11, 10, 9  
Node 14 is connected to: 7, 3, 5, 6, 10

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 14  
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 13  
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12  

For nodes with 6 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with each node is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).  
For nodes with 5 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with each node is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).  
For nodes with 4 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars formed with each node is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 6 neighbors: 5 nodes * 20 3-stars/node = 100  
For nodes with 5 neighbors: 4 nodes * 10 3-stars/node = 40  
For nodes with 4 neighbors: 6 nodes * 4 3-stars/node = 24  

Total number of 3-stars: 100 + 40 + 24 = 164  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [164].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<1, (6, 5, 10)>
<2, (12, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 13, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (4, 3, 0)>
<9, (4, 13, 10)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (1, 13, 2)>
<12, (7, 2, 0)>
