Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can construct the following 3-stars:

\[ [4, (1, 3, 9)], [7, (0, 2, 5)], [1, (0, 3, 4)], [3, (0, 1, 4)], [6, (5, 7, 9)], [9, (4, 6, 8)], [8, (2, 6, 9)], [5, (1, 2, 7)] \]

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of 8 unique 3-stars formed, which can be represented as:

\[ [8] \]
