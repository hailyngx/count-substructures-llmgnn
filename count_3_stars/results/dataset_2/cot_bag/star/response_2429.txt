Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11).
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 11), (1, 5), (1, 14).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 14).
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 1), (4, 2).
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 14).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3).
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 13), (9, 0), (9, 13).
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 12).
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: (13, 9), (13, 11), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 5).
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (14, 4), (14, 10), (14, 5), (14, 1), (14, 3).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node, we get:
- Node 0 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74.

Therefore, the final answer is [74].
