Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

For the nodes listed above, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 12, 17)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 19)>, <3, (8, 11, 12)>, <7, (1, 15, 18)>, <9, (5, 19, 0)>, <11, (3, 18, 12)>, <12, (3, 11, 17)>, <17, (0, 12, 19)>, <18, (5, 11, 13)>, <19, (2, 7, 17)>
