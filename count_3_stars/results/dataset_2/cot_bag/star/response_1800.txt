Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node and its neighbors. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: \( (0, 8), (0, 6), (0, 2) \) --> form 1 3-star
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: \( (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 2) \) --> form 1 3-star
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: \( (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1) \) --> form 6 3-stars
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: \( (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 6) \) --> form 6 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: \( (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2) \) --> form 6 3-stars
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: \( (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3) \) --> form 1 3-star
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0) \) --> form 4 3-stars
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: \( (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3) \) --> form 1 3-star
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: \( (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 6) \) --> form 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: \( (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7) \) --> form 6 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 6] = [30] \)

Unique 3-stars:
