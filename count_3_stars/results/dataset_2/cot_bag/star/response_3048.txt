Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows: 

1: (5, 0, 10)  
2: (4, 7, 8, 0, 6)   
3: (12, 14, 11, 6)   
4: (7, 11, 2)   
5: (9, 8, 1)  
6: (12, 2, 3)   
7: (4, 2, 13, 8)   
8: (5, 7, 2, 14, 10)   
9: (5, 10, 0, 12)   
10: (9, 2, 8, 0, 1)   
11: (4, 14, 3)   
12: (9, 6, 3, 1)   
13: (7, 14)  
14: (8, 0, 11, 3, 13)  

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 55

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (12, 14, 11)>
<8, (5, 7, 10)>
<8, (2, 7, 14)>
<9, (5, 10, 12)>
<10, (2, 8, 0)>
<12, (3, 6, 9)>
<14, (8, 0, 11)>
