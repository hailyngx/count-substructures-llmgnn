Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each such node to find the number of 3-stars it participates in. 

Let's analyze the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 6, 9, 7, 5
- Node 2: 6, 4, 7, 5
- Node 3: 4, 7, 5, 0
- Node 4: 9, 7, 3, 2
- Node 5: 6, 8, 2, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 4, 3, 2, 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 5
- Node 9: 4, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <1, (6, 7, 5)>, <1, (9, 7, 5)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 0, 3)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 5, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 3)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (7, 2, 1)>, <3, (7, 2, 5)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (6, 8, 2)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 7, 3)>, <5, (8, 7, 2)>, <5, (8, 7, 1)>, <5, (8, 2, 1)>, <5, (8, 2, 0)>, <5, (8, 2, 3)>, <5, (7, 2, 1)>, <5, (7, 2, 3)>, <5, (7, 1, 3)>, <5, (7, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 3, 0)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 2, 1)>, <7, (3, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 0)>, <7, (2, 5, 0)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (6, 7, 5)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (4, 1, 0)>

By summing up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 46 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
