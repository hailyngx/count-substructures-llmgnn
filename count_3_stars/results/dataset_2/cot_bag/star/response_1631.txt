Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's list out the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, and 12 <6, (4, 10, 12)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5 <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8 <3, (1, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 12 <7, (2, 3, 12)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 13 <12, (7, 8, 13)>
6. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 10 <2, (5, 7, 10)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 14 <8, (0, 9, 14)>
8. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6 <10, (1, 2, 6)>
9. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 11 <5, (1, 4, 11)>
10. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 11 <14, (6, 8, 11)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed based on the nodes that have three or more neighbors, we find that there are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.
