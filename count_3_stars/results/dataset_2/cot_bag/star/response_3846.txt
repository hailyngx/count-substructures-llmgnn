Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 6), (0, 4), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 0)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up:  10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 53.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 3)>
- <8, (4, 7, 3)>
