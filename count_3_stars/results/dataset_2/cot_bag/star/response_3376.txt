Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 3: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 11: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 12: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 13: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 14: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 15: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 16: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 18: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 19: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 71

So, the total number of 3-stars is [71].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 16)>
<1, (8, 14, 15)>
<2, (6, 10, 5)>
<3, (4, 9, 18)>
<4, (3, 12, 13)>
<6, (0, 7, 16)>
<7, (10, 6, 19)>
<9, (3, 15, 16)>
<13, (4, 14, 19)>
<14, (1, 12, 18)>
<15, (1, 9, 11)>
<16, (0, 6, 9)>
<18, (3, 11, 14)>
<19, (5, 7, 13)>
