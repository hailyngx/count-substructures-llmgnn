Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: {21, 3, 6, 22}
2: {0, 19, 7}
3: {1, 9, 27, 8, 18}
4: {16, 25, 20}
5: {21}
6: {1, 17, 13}
7: {2, 28, 25, 15, 13}
8: {3, 22, 28, 20}
9: {14, 3, 19, 12}
11: {13, 15}
12: {9, 16}
13: {7, 11, 6, 20}
14: {9, 28, 24}
15: {29, 7, 11}
16: {4, 12, 20}
17: {0, 6, 25}
18: {3}
19: {9, 2, 23, 24}
20: {4, 16, 8, 13}
21: {1, 26, 28, 5}
22: {26, 1, 27, 8}
23: {29, 19}
24: {28, 14, 19}
25: {17, 4, 7}
26: {22, 21}
27: {3, 22}
28: {21, 8, 7, 14, 24}
29: {23, 15}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.  
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 3 forms 10 3-stars.  
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.  
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 7 forms 6 3-stars.  
Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.  
Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.  
Node 11 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 12 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 13 forms 4 3-stars.  
Node 14 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 15 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 16 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 17 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 19 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 20 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 21 forms 4 3-stars.  
Node 22 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 23 forms 0 3-stars.  
Node 24 forms 1 3-star.    
Node 25 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 26 forms 0 3-stars.  
Node 27 forms 1 3-star.  
Node 28 forms 4 3-stars.  
Node 29 forms 0 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 52.

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 22)>
<1, (3, 21, 22)>
<1, (6, 21, 22)>
<1, (3, 21, 6)>
<2, (0, 19, 7)>
<3, (9, 27, 8)>
<3, (9, 18, 8)>
<3, (9, 27, 22)>
<3, (9, 18, 22)>
<3, (18, 27, 22)>
<4, (16, 25, 20)>
<6, (1, 17, 13)>
<7, (15, 11, 13)>

<13, (7, 11, 15)>
<14, (24, 19, 28)>
<21, (1, 5, 28)>
