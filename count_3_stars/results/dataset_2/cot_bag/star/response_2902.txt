Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 18) (18, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 7) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (3, 14, 15)>
<1, (3, 14, 1)>
<1, (3, 15, 1)>
<1, (14, 15, 1)>

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (1, 9, 15)>
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<3, (1, 15, 9)>
<3, (1, 15, 12)>

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (0, 5, 15)>
<4, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (0, 15, 5)>
<4, (5, 15, 4)>

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (4, 10, 13)>
<5, (4, 10, 6)>
<5, (10, 13, 6)>
<5, (10, 13, 19)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (5, 10, 11)>
<6, (5, 10, 6)>
<6, (5, 11, 6)>
<6, (10, 11, 6)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (2, 12, 3)>
<9, (2, 12, 9)>
<9, (2, 15, 3)>
<9, (2, 15, 12)>

Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<10,(5, 13, 19)>
<10,(5, 13, 6)>
<10,(5, 13, 10)>
<10,(5, 19, 6)>
<10,(5, 19, 13)>
<10,(13, 19, 6)>
<10,(13, 19, 5)>
<10,(13, 6, 5)>
<10,(19, 6, 5)>
<10,(19, 13, 5)>

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (1, 9, 15)>
<12, (1, 9, 12)>
<12, (1, 15, 9)>
<12, (9, 15, 12)>

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<13, (5, 10, 19)>
<13, (5, 10, 13)>
<13, (5, 19, 10)>
<13, (10, 19, 13)>

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (2, 17, 1)>
<14, (2, 17, 13)>
<14, (2, 1, 13)>
<14, (17, 1, 13)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<15, (1, 3, 14)>
<15, (1, 3, 12)>
<15, (1, 14, 3)>
<15, (3, 14, 12)>

Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (0, 11, 14)>
<17, (0, 11, 17)>
<17, (0, 14, 17)>
<17, (11, 14, 17)>

Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<19, (5, 8, 13)>
<19, (5, 8, 19)>
<19, (5, 13, 8)>
<19, (8, 13, 19)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].
