Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 13) (23, 21) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 2) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 6) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 26) (21, 25) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 19) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (5, 2) (3, 18) (1, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 16) (19, 4) (9, 17) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to see which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 20: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 2 neighbors

Nodes 15, 16, 18, and 22 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by the remaining nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (7, 10, 14)>, <2, (6, 10, 20)>, <6, (2, 4, 17)>, <10, (0, 11, 15)>, <11, (7, 13, 21)>, <12, (4, 18, 29)>, <13, (17, 19, 27)>, <17, (6, 13, 23)>, <19, (13, 16, 27)>, <20, (2, 22, 26)>, <21, (11, 25, 26)>, <26, (16, 20, 28)>
