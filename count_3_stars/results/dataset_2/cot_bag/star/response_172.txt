Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with degree 1: 7, 8, 13, 0, 11

There are 2 nodes with degree 2: 2, 3

There are 2 nodes with degree 4: 9, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 = 8]

Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 1, 10)>, <13, (2, 5, 14)>
