Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 10) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 18) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 11) (18, 13) (18, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
There are 18 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which we will consider for forming 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (1 unique 3-star)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 36, which we represent as [36].
