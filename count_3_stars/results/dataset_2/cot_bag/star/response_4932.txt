Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up, we get: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 14)>, <2, (4, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 6, 14)>, <2, (7, 6, 14)>, <4, (7, 6, 14)>, <5, (1, 11, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 13)>, <5, (5, 9, 11)>, <5, (8, 12, 4)>, <5, (8, 14, 2)>, <6, (7, 12, 4)>, <6, (10, 11, 6)>, <6, (10, 14, 2)>, <6, (14, 2, 7)>, <8, (13, 9, 5)>, <8, (14, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 12)>, <8, (2, 6, 14)>, <8, (7, 4, 12)>, <10, (10, 14, 6)>, <11, (11, 9, 13)>, <12, (12, 11, 8)>, <13, (13, 8, 10)>, <14, (14, 10, 6)>.
