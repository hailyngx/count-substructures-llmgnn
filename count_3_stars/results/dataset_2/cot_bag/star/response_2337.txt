Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 15) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 13) (18, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 1) (4, 13) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15) 

Response:
We will now determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = C(5, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(4, 3)
              = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4
              = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 12, 15)>, <2, (1, 7, 18)>, <3, (5, 12, 19)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 9, 10)>, <8, (2, 13, 18)>, <9, (6, 10, 14)>, <10, (9, 14, 16)>, <11, (16, 19, 3)>, <12, (0, 15, 18)>, <13, (4, 18, 8)>, <15, (7, 12, 16)>, <16, (10, 11, 15)>, <19, (1, 3, 17)>.

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
