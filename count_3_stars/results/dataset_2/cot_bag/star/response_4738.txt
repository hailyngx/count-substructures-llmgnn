Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 2.
   So, there are [inom{4}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 0. 
   There are [C(4,3) = 4] 3-stars with node 0:
   <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 2)>, <0, (1, 7, 2)>, <0, (4, 7, 2)>

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8, 7.
   So, there are [inom{5}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 1. 
   There are [C(5,3) = 10] 3-stars with node 1:
   <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, 
   <1, (0, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 8, 7)>

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 5.
   So, there are [inom{4}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 2. 
   There are [C(4,3) = 4] 3-stars with node 2:
   <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 5)>

4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9.
   So, there are [inom{5}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 3. 
   There are [C(5,3) = 10] 3-stars with node 3:
   <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, 
   <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8.
   So, there are [inom{4}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 4. 
   There are [C(4,3) = 4] 3-stars with node 4:
   <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>

6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 2.
   So, there are [inom{5}{3}] possible 3-stars with node 5. 
   There are [C(5,3) = 10] 3-stars with node 5:
   <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 2)>,
   <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>, <5, (4, 6, 2)>

7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 3.
   There is 1 possible 3-star with node 6: 
   <6, (2, 5, 3)>

8. All other nodes (7, 8, 9) have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 40.
Thus, the final answer is [40].
