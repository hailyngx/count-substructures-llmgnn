Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (22, 7) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 28) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 26) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 26) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 6) (20, 27) (20, 29) (4, 22) (4, 26) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 18) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 10) (19, 15) (19, 22) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 25) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (24, 22) (10, 9) (10, 25) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes.

For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 45 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
