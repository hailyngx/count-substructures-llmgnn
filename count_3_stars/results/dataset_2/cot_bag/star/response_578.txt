Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 8) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
The central nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 11, 10, 3, 16, 1, 13, 0, 7, 5, 10, 19, 12, 9, 2, and 6.  

For 15 central nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each.  

For central node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For central node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
For central node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For central node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For central node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For central node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For central node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For central node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 27 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars is 27.  

Therefore, the answer is [27] with the unique 3-stars found being:  
<11, (10, 3, 5)>  
<10, (11, 18, 19)>  
<10, (11, 3, 10)>  
<10, (19, 17, 14)>  
<3, (11, 7, 10)>  
<16, (12, 6, 9)>  
<1, (13, 0, 4)>  
<13, (1, 18, 4)>  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<7, (3, 0, 19)>  
<7, (19, 2, 5)>  
<7, (19, 14, 2)>  
<7, (19, 14, 6)>  
<5, (11, 2, 8)>  
<5, (11, 15, 2)>
