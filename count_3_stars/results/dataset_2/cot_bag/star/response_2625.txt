Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

We observe that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 
Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 47 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (8, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 1)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
