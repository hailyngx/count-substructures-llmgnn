Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 17) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 27) (25, 3) (25, 2) (18, 27) (18, 22) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 7) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 11) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 4) (29, 21) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 12) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 12) (21, 26) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 2) (17, 26) (17, 27) (20, 21) (20, 23) (19, 15) (19, 23) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 21) (8, 22) (8, 7) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 24) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (10, 6) (4, 29) (4, 15) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's determine the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (27, 1, 2, 29) -> [1]
    - <0, (27, 1, 2)>
    - <0, (27, 1, 29)>
    - <0, (27, 2, 29)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 29)>

2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 25, 1, 21) -> [1]
    - <2, (0, 25, 1)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 21)>
    - <2, (0, 25, 21)>
    - <2, (25, 1, 21)>

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (25, 28, 7, 22) -> [1]
    - <3, (25, 28, 7)>
    - <3, (25, 7, 22)>
    - <3, (25, 28, 22)>
    - <3, (28, 7, 22)>

4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (15, 16, 29) -> [1]
    - <4, (15, 16, 29)>

5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (28, 21, 10, 12) -> [1]
    - <6, (28, 21, 10)>
    - <6, (28, 21, 12)>
    - <6, (28, 10, 12)>
    - <6, (21, 10, 12)>

6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (26, 3, 1, 8) -> [1]
    - <7, (26, 3, 1)>
    - <7, (26, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (26, 1, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 1, 8)>

7. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (15, 19, 26) -> [1]
    - <9, (15, 19, 26)>

8. Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (5, 12, 28) -> [1]
    - <11, (5, 12, 28)>

9. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (24, 15, 29) -> [1]
    - <14, (24, 15, 29)>

10. Node 21 has 5 neighbors: (26, 29, 6, 20, 2) -> [1]
    - <21, (26, 29, 6)>
    - <21, (26, 29, 20)>
    - <21, (26, 29, 2)>
    - <21, (6, 20, 29)>
    - <21, (6, 2, 29)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [10].
