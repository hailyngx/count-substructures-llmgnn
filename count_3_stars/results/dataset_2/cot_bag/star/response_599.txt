Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 1) (1, 29) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 28) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 23) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 0) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 4) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (26, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 10) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 25) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 9) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 24) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 10) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 20) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 7) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (18, 16) (18, 20) (20, 24) (20, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 15, 27, 29, 1, 3, 22, 23, 8, 13, 6, 28, 0, 14, 21, 16, 9, 4, 12, 19, 11, 5, 7, 24, 10, 25, 18, 20.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 15: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 27: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 29: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 1: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 3: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 22: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 23: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 13: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 28: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 0: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 14: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 21: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 16: 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 4: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 12: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 19: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 24: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 10: 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 25: 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 18: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 20: 3-stars = C(2, 3) = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<15, 14, 11>
<27, 15, 29>
<3, 1, 29>
<22, 19, 25>
<8, 10, 28>
<13, 26, 0>
<6, 7, 4>
<21, 5, 16>
<12, 9, 22>
<24, 20, 18>
<10, 5, 7>
<25, 4, 23>
