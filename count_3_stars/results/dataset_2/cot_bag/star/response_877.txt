Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Applying the 3-star graph definition to the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 2, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 8, 0, 1, 3
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 3, 2
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 6, 8, 1, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 4, 1, 0
- Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 2, 3
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 2, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 1

Following the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>
  
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 0, 1)>, <2, (8, 0, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>
  
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 0)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 2)>, <3, (6, 8, 0)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>, <3, (6, 2, 7)>, <3, (6, 0, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 7)>, <3, (4, 0, 7)>, <3, (8, 2, 0)>, <3, (8, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 0, 7)>, <3, (2, 0, 7)>
  
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>, <4, (3, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 0, 7)>
  
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>
  
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars calculated: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].
