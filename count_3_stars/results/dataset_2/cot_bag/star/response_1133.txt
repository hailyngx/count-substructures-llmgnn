Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's build the graph:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 9), (7, 1), (10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 8), (10, 1), (11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 5), (11, 8), (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 0), (13, 8), (13, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 3), (5, 11), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 5), (0, 1), (14, 4), (14, 12), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 5), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2), (9, 7), (9, 11), (9, 1), (9, 12), (12, 14), (12, 9), (12, 1), (1, 7), (1, 10), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 9), (1, 12)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 12: inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 78

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 10)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 13)>
