Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
