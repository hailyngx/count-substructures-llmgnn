Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 18) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 18) (25, 16) (25, 20) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 19) (15, 23) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 23) (17, 11) (17, 28) (17, 4) (17, 22) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 21) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (19, 15) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (7, 28) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 11) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 10) (14, 2) (14, 29) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 18) (8, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 15) (23, 12) (23, 29) (21, 26) (21, 2) (10, 9) (10, 3) (22, 17) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes. 

From the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- For node 1: 3-stars = 1
- For node 2: 3-stars = 2
- For node 4: 3-stars = 1
- For node 6: 3-stars = 1
- For node 7: 3-stars = 1
- For node 8: 3-stars = 2
- For node 9: 3-stars = 2
- For node 11: 3-stars = 4
- For node 12: 3-stars = 4
- For node 16: 3-stars = 1
- For node 17: 3-stars = 2
- For node 18: 3-stars = 6
- For node 20: 3-stars = 1
- For node 24: 3-stars = 1
- For node 25: 3-stars = 1
- For node 26: 3-stars = 1
- For node 27: 3-stars = 1
- For node 28: 3-stars = 1
- For node 29: 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
