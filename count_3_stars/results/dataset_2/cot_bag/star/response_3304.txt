Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 19) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (20, 27) (20, 7) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 22) (5, 4) (5, 17) (6, 0) (6, 22) (6, 15) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 3) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 16) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 14) (2, 27) (12, 18) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 11) (3, 19) (3, 13) (7, 20) (7, 28) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 14) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) 

Response:
Since we are given a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can start by determining the degree of each node.

Looking at the list of edges given, we can count the number of times each node appears in an edge to determine its degree:

- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 5
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 5

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0, 9, 19, 27, and 28 have degrees greater than or equal to 3, so we can calculate the 3-star count for each of them.

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 44.

Listing the unique 3-star formations:
\[ 
<0, 10, 17, 23>, \,
<9, 8, 11, 24>, \,
<19, 26, 13, 17>, \,
<27, 2, 20, 7>, \,
<28, 18, 26, 9>
\]

Putting it all together, the final answer is \( [44] \).
