Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be drawn as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
