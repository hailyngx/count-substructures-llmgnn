Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 17) (20, 12) (20, 21) (25, 17) (25, 12) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3) (21, 20) (21, 6) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 0) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 19) (27, 18) (27, 26) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12) (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 24) (14, 1) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 19, 28, 5, 12
- Node 1: 0, 17, 15, 14
- Node 2: 22, 26
- Node 3: 17, 6, 23, 29
- Node 4: 19, 23, 16
- Node 5: 0, 16
- Node 6: 22, 21, 3
- Node 7: 11, 18, 17
- Node 8: 13, 28, 24
- Node 9: 14, 23
- Node 10: 29
- Node 11: 7, 26, 12
- Node 12: 13, 20, 25, 11, 0
- Node 13: 22, 8, 12
- Node 14: 1, 9
- Node 15: 1, 24, 16
- Node 16: 4, 15, 5, 26
- Node 17: 7, 25, 1, 3
- Node 18: 7, 27, 24
- Node 19: 4, 0, 27
- Node 20: 12, 21
- Node 21: 20, 6
- Node 22: 13, 2, 6
- Node 23: 4, 3, 9
- Node 24: 8, 15, 18
- Node 25: 17, 12
- Node 26: 2, 11, 27, 29, 16
- Node 27: 19, 18, 26
- Node 28: 8, 0
- Node 29: 10, 3, 26

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 19, and 28, so there are 3 3-stars. (3 choose 3 = 1)
Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 17, 6, and 23, so there are 3 3-stars. (3 choose 3 = 1)
Node 12 forms 3-stars with nodes 13, 20, and 25, so there are 3 3-stars. (3 choose 3 = 1)
Node 16 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 15, and 5, so there are 3 3-stars. (3 choose 3 = 1)
Node 26 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 11, and 27, so there are 3 3-stars. (3 choose 3 = 1)

Adding these up, we have a total of [15] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 19, 28>
<3, 17, 6, 23>
<12, 13, 20, 25>
<16, 4, 15, 5>
<26, 2, 11, 27>
