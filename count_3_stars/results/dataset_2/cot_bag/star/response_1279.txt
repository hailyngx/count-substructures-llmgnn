Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 = 5 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45\)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [45].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
