Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 3) (2, 18) (5, 6) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 17) (16, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 13, 10, 17, 7, and 3.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 1, 15.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 11, 5, 1, 14.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 12, 0, 15.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 13, 18, 3.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 7, 15, 3.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 15, 9, 0.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 18, 19, 16.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 13, 4, 7, 12, 19.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 17, 14.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 10, 11, 16, 0.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 10, 17)>
<0, (13, 10, 7)>
<0, (13, 10, 3)>
<0, (13, 17, 7)>
<0, (13, 17, 3)>
<0, (13, 7, 3)>
<0, (10, 17, 7)>
<0, (10, 17, 3)>
<0, (10, 7, 3)>
<0, (17, 7, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 15)>
<6, (11, 5, 1)>
<6, (11, 5, 14)>
<6, (5, 1, 14)>
<6, (1, 14, 18)>
<7, (12, 15, 3)>
<9, (13, 18, 3)>
<12, (7, 15, 3)>
<13, (15, 9, 0)>
<14, (6, 18, 19)>
<15, (13, 4, 7)>
<16, (17, 14, 19)>
<17, (10, 11, 16)>
<9, (13, 18, 3)>
<17, (10, 11, 16)>
