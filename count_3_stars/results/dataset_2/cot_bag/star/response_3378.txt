Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \]

So, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 0, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
