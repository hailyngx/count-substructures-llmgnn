Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 1, 11, 4, 8, 2, 7, 12, 0, 14, and 13.

For node 5, there are 5 available neighbors (9, 6, 8, 12, 7). Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (8, 12, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 12)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 12, 7)>, <5, (6, 12, 7)>.

For node 9, there are 4 available neighbors (5, 1, 0, 12). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>, <9, (5, 0, 12)>, <9, (1, 0, 12)>.

For the remaining nodes with three or more neighbors, they each have less than 3 possible 3-stars, so we won't count any additional 3-stars from them.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from node 5 and node 9, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 = 14 \). Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [14].
