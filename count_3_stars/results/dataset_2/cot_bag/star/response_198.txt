Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 15) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (16, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 10
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4
- Node 15: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 16: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4
- Node 18: 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 4
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1

Adding up all the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 37 3-stars in the graph, which we write as [37].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 12)>, <1, (2, 10, 13)>, <1, (2, 10, 18)>, <1, (2, 13, 18)>, <1, (10, 13, 18)>, <1, (13, 15, 18)>, <2, (9, 13, 18)>, <3, (4, 16, 3)>, <4, (7, 14, 16)>, <4, (16, 18, 5)>, <4, (16, 18, 8)>, <4, (16, 18, 13)>, <8, (7, 16, 19)>, <8, (13, 16, 19)>, <8, (16, 17, 19)>, <13, (8, 12, 15)>, <15, (12, 18, 19)>, <15, (13, 18, 19)>, <15, (15, 18, 19)>, <16, (11, 15, 19)>, <16, (5, 15, 19)>.
