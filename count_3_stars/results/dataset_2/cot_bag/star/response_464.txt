Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can construct the 3-star graph as follows:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors as well, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 5(4) + 2(1) + 1 = 40 \).

Therefore, there are 40 unique 3-stars in this graph, listed inside <> as follows:
<5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 0, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 1, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>
