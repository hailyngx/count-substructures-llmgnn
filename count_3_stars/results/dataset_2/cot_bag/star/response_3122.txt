Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 5, 2, 8, and 0.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars up, we get a total of 30 3-stars. So, the final answer is [30].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
- Node 4: <4, (7, 0, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 9, 5)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 7, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (7, 1, 2)>
- Node 5: <5, (7, 6, 1)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 3, 5)>
- Node 8: <8, (6, 1, 3)>
- Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
