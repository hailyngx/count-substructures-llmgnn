Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 10) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 14) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 13) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 24) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 10) (19, 15) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 3) (17, 5) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (20, 22) (20, 21) (21, 20) (21, 5) (10, 16) (10, 24) (10, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (27, 18) (27, 8) (13, 29) (13, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 15) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 4 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 5 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges
- Node 10: 3 edges
- Node 11: 3 edges
- Node 12: 3 edges
- Node 13: 2 edges
- Node 14: 2 edges
- Node 15: 3 edges
- Node 16: 3 edges
- Node 17: 5 edges
- Node 18: 5 edges
- Node 19: 4 edges
- Node 20: 2 edges
- Node 21: 2 edges
- Node 22: 5 edges
- Node 23: 2 edges
- Node 24: 5 edges
- Node 25: 3 edges
- Node 26: 4 edges
- Node 27: 2 edges
- Node 28: 2 edges
- Node 29: 3 edges

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

By inspecting the degrees, we can see that the nodes with at least three edges are: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, and 26. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3}  = 15 + 15 + 15 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 15 + 1 + 15 = 139
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 139. 
So, the answer is [139].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (26, 9, 3)>, <5, (18, 17, 19)>, <6, (24, 10, 16)>, <7, (29, 8, 22)>, <8, (27, 17, 3)>, <9, (8, 0, 23)>, <10, (3, 24, 16)>, <11, (25, 16, 6)>, <12, (17, 24, 26)>, <17, (8, 19, 27)>, <18, (5, 4, 22)>, <19, (15, 17, 13)>, <22, (1, 7, 20)>, <24, (22, 12, 10)>, <26, (29, 0, 12)>, <29, (13, 26, 7)>
