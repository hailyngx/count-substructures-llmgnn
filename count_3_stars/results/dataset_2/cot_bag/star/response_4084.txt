Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 16) (22, 21) (22, 8) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 20) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (8, 22) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 1) (27, 24) (27, 11) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 7) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 4) (26, 6) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 25) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 23) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (17, 16) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (23, 19) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 23) (16, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 17) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 21) (10, 26) (10, 20) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 23) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 28) (29, 19) (29, 21) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 24) (21, 29) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 3, node 5, node 8, node 11, and node 15.

For node 3, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed: <3, (1, 15, 9)>.

For node 5, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed: <5, (4, 13, 25)>.

For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed: 
- <8, (4, 1, 15)>
- <8, (4, 1, 22)>
- <8, (4, 1, 8)>
- <8, (4, 15, 22)>.

For node 11, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed: <11, (0, 23, 27)>.

For node 15, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed: 
- <15, (1, 7, 8)>
- <15, (1, 7, 15)>
- <15, (1, 7, 28)>
- <15, (1, 8, 22)>.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 11 \).
