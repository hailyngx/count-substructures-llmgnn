Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 73

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [73].
