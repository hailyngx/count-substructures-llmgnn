Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 15) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 15) (6, 22) (6, 18) (9, 5) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 29) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 4) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 3) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 28) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 29) (7, 2) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 24) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 19) (26, 20) (26, 29) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 29) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 24) (28, 15) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 26) (29, 18) (10, 12) (10, 22) (24, 19) (24, 12) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 61\).

So the answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 27, 23)>, 
<2, (7, 13, 27)>, 
<3, (0, 14, 25)>, 
<4, (8, 17, 20)>, 
<5, (9, 8, 29)>, 
<8, (5, 13, 4)>, 
<11, (16, 15, 19)>, 
<13, (8, 18, 2)>, 
<15, (11, 20, 28)>, 
<16, (11, 15, 22)>, 
<17, (4, 20, 14)>, 
<18, (6, 19, 8)>, 
<19, (11, 21, 24)>, 
<20, (1, 17, 15)>, 
<22, (16, 21, 10)>, 
<23, (0, 25, 19)>, 
<24, (12, 19, 0)>, 
<25, (3, 29, 23)>, 
<26, (20, 29)>, 
<27, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<29, (5, 25, 18)>.
