Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 3, 10, 1, 8, 7, 12, 0, 14, 5, 2, 13, 4, and 11. 

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1] = [113] \)

Unique 3-stars:

<6, (3, 5, 14)>
<6, (9, 14, 5)>
<6, (10, 5, 11)>
