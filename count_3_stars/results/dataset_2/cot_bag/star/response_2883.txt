Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:

\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 68. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ <1, (12, 14, 5)>, <1, (12, 14, 2)>, <1, (5, 2, 14)>, <1, (7, 14, 12)>, <2, (12, 14, 5)>, <2, (5, 12, 14)>, <2, (4, 13, 9)>, <2, (4, 13, 7)>, <3, (0, 10, 13)>, <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (7, 10, 13)>, <3, (10, 7, 13)>, <4, (9, 13, 7)>, <5, (11, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 8, 12)>, <7, (0, 10, 13)>, <9, (13, 7, 4)>, <13, (10, 7, 3)> \]

So, the final answer is [68].
