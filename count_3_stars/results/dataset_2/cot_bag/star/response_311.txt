Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 84

So, there are a total of 84 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 13>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 12>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 10, 14>, <1, 13, 14>, <2, 8, 11>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 11, 14>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 14>, <6, 7, 12>, <6, 12, 0>, <7, 8, 12>, <7, 8, 13>, <8, 12, 3>, <10, 11, 14>, <10,13, 14>, <12, 7, 11>, <12, 7, 13>, <12, 8, 1>, <12, 8, 3>, <12, 8, 7>, <13, 7, 14>]
