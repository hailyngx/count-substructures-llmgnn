Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (3, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 19) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 2) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 17) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1:  C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9:  C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 11: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 12: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 13: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 14: C(2, 3) = 0
- Node 17: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 18: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 19: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (10, 17, 19)>, 
<1, (3, 13, 16)>, 
<2, (8, 14, 18)>, 
<4, (1, 13, 18)>, 
<5, (12, 19, 7)>, 
<7, (11, 17, 5)>, 
<9, (10, 17, 11)>, 
<10, (9, 0, 11)>, 
<11, (10, 9, 7)>, 
<12, (18, 5, 19)>, 
<13, (1, 4, 16)>, 
<18, (2, 7, 4)>, 
<19, (5, 6, 17)>
