Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 18) (0, 23) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 26) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 25) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 8) (6, 17) (28, 7) (28, 23) (9, 18) (9, 29) (9, 23) (26, 14) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 5) (3, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 2) (24, 27) (24, 5) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 11) (8, 29) (8, 16) (4, 14) (4, 16) (25, 21) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (nodes 17, 7, 2, 19)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (nodes 3, 1, 10, 19, 25)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 13, 24, 15, 10)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 21, 15, 28, 1)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 18, 29, 23)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (nodes 17, 23, 20, 25)
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (nodes 27, 13, 25)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (nodes 17, 26, 19, 4)
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (nodes 7, 21, 26, 5)
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (nodes 14, 1, 6, 11)
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (nodes 22, 9, 20, 29)
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors (nodes 18, 26, 11)
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors (nodes 7, 10, 25, 15)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 28, 9, 11)
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors (nodes 21, 12, 11, 2)
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (nodes 14, 27, 15, 20)
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors (nodes 18, 9, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 54 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 54, which can be written as [54].

- <1, (17, 2, 19)>
- <1, (7, 2, 19)>
- <1, (17, 7, 2)>
- <2, (3, 10, 19)>

- <26, (27, 15, 20)>
