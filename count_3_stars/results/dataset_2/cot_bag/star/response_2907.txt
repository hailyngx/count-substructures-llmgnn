Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, and 13. 

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: {5, 6, 3, 10, 8, 13}. It can form 6 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {1, 11, 4, 8, 14}. It can form 10 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: {7, 8, 12, 14, 2, 4}. It can form 15 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 0, 10}. There is only 1 3-star that can be formed with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {5, 9, 12, 0}. There is only 1 3-star that can be formed with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 1, 13, 12}. It can form 10 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {5, 0, 12}. There is only 1 3-star that can be formed with its 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: {9, 6, 10, 4, 8, 13}. It can form 15 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 12, 0, 14}. It can form 10 3-stars with each of its 3 neighbors, making a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed from each node: 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 93.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [93].
