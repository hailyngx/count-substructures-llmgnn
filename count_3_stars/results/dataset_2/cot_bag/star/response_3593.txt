Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are: 
<2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <2, (6, 9, 14)>,  
<3, (8, 5, 12)>, <4, (0, 1, 11)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (11, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (9, 14, 10)>, <9, (3, 12, 13)>, <10, (1, 13, 14)>, <11, (4, 5, 12)>.
