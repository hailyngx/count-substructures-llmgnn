Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so no 3-stars are formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 62 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 14, 10)>
<3, (7, 13, 18)>
<6, (11, 12, 17)>
<7, (3, 5, 1)>
<8, (2, 15, 6)>
<10, (2, 1, 7)>
<11, (6, 12, 17)>
<12, (6, 11, 17)>
<15, (8, 16, 18)>
<16, (15, 17, 8)>
<17, (16, 12, 6)>
<18, (6, 3, 15)>
