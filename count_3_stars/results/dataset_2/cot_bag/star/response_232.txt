Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 13) (10, 15) (10, 24) (11, 3) (11, 4) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 12) (25, 6) (25, 1) (25, 14) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 2) (4, 22) (4, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (7, 5) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 16) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 28) (13, 23) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 27) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 27) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (24, 6) (24, 10) (29, 18) (29, 8) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 27) (28, 15) (28, 17) (14, 18) (14, 25) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 6, 15, 16, and 22.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
3. Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
4. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 22 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48 \).

Thus, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
