Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 18) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 2) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 4, 8, 6, 13, 1, 15, 19, 2, 12, 18, 9, 11, and 7.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 39 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 8, 17)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<8, (5, 4, 15)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<13, (10, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 15, 19)>
<15, (8, 1, 7)>
<19, (14, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 12, 16)>
<12, (8, 19, 2)>
<18, (17, 12, 16)>
<9, (4, 11, 3)>
<11, (9, 18, 3)>
<7, (6, 15, 19)>
