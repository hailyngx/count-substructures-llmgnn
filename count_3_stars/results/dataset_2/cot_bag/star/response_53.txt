Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors: 11, 14, 19, 2)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 11, 3, 18, 6)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 19, 18)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 8, 14, 1, 13)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 9, 17, 0, 3, 2)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 16, 18, 7, 6, 12)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 5, 4, 15, 12)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 5, 0, 8, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

For Node 4:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

For Node 5:
- no 3-star can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

For Node 9:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

For Node 14:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]

For Node 15:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]

For Node 18:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

For Node 19:
- 3-stars: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40

So, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (11, 14, 19)>, <0, (11, 14, 2)>, <0, (11, 19, 2)>, <0, (14, 19, 2)>, 
<4, (11, 3, 18)>, <4, (11, 3, 6)>, <4, (11, 18, 6)>, <4, (3, 18, 6)>, 
<9, (8, 14, 1)>, <9, (8, 14, 13)>, <9, (8, 1, 13)>, <9, (14, 1, 13)>, 
<14, (17, 3, 2)>, <14, (17, 0, 2)>, <14, (17, 3, 0)>, <14, (17, 0, 3)>, <14, (3, 2, 0)>, 
<15, (16, 7, 12)>, <15, (16, 6, 12)>, <15, (7, 6, 12)>, 
<18, (5, 15, 12)>, <18, (4, 15, 12)>, <18, (5, 4, 12)>, <18, (5, 4, 15)>, 
<19, (5, 8, 2)>, <19, (5, 8, 6)>, <19, (5, 2, 6)>, <19, (8, 2, 6)>
