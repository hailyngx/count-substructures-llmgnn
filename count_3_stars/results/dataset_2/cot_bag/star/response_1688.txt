Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Let's create a visual representation of the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9, 10, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 12, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 13, and 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 11, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 12, and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 10, 14)>, <1, (0, 7, 14)>, <1, (9, 10, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)> (Total: 5)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: <3, (5, 9, 12)>, <3, (5, 11, 14)>, <3, (9, 11, 12)>, <3, (9, 12, 14)>, <3, (11, 12, 14)> (Total: 5)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (2, 10, 14)>, <6, (10, 12, 14)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>, <6, (13, 14, 2)> (Total: 4)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: <10, (1, 9, 12)>, <10, (1, 12, 14)>, <10, (9, 12, 13)>, <10, (12, 13, 14)> (Total: 4)
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors: <12, (0, 1, 13)>, <12, (0, 9, 13)>, <12, (0, 10, 13)>, <12, (1, 9, 10)>, <12, (1, 9, 14)>, <12, (9, 10, 14)> (Total: 6)
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: <14, (1, 3, 7)>, <14, (2, 6, 7)>, <14, (2, 6, 3)>, <14, (6, 7, 1)>, <14, (6, 3, 1)> (Total: 5)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
