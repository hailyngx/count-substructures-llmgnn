Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 19) (3, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 24) (8, 21) (15, 1) (20, 17) (0, 14) (0, 21) (19, 26) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 28) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 6) (22, 28) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 28) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 24) (28, 19) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 18) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 18) (21, 25) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 12) (12, 21) (6, 7) (6, 22) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 29) (10, 9) (10, 29) (10, 27) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 27) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 13, 17, and 11.
- Node 5 has neighbors 7, 18, 19.
- Node 8 has neighbors 21, 24, 25, and 26.
- Node 11 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 23, and 26.
- Node 13 has neighbors 2, 16, 28, and 29.
- Node 14 has neighbors 0, 17, 27.
- Node 16 has neighbors 13, 27, 29.
- Node 17 has neighbors 2, 14, 20.
- Node 18 has neighbors 5, 24, 28, 29.
- Node 19 has neighbors 1, 5, 26, 28.
- Node 21 has neighbors 0, 8, 12, 25.
- Node 22 has neighbors 3, 6, 25, 28.
- Node 24 has neighbors 8, 18, 23.
- Node 25 has neighbors 8, 21, 22.
- Node 26 has neighbors 8, 11, 19, 23, 29.
- Node 28 has neighbors 13, 18, 19, 22.

Now, let's count the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [47] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 13, 17)>
- <5, (7, 18, 19)>
- <8, (21, 24, 25)>
- <11, (1, 2, 4)>
- <13, (2, 16, 28)>
- <14, (0, 17, 27)>
- <16, (13, 27, 29)>
- <17, (2, 14, 20)>
- <18, (5, 24, 28)>
- <19, (1, 5, 26)>
- <21, (0, 8, 25)>
- <22, (3, 6, 25)>
- <24, (8, 18, 23)>
- <25, (8, 21, 22)>
- <26, (8, 11, 19)>
- <28, (13, 18, 19)>
