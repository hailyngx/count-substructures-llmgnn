Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are node 3, node 6, node 10, node 11, and node 12.
Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
