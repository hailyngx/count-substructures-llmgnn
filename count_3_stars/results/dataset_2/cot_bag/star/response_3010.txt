Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have 6, 5, 5, 7, 5, 5, and 5 neighbors respectively.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 95 \)

So, there are 95 3-stars in the graph, and we can list them as follows:
[<2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>]
