Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's organize the information into a list format for easier analysis:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
(9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) 
(8, 13) (8, 0) 
(13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) 
(4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
(7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) 
(12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2)
(0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2)
(14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) 
(3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2)
(11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) 
(2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) 
(1, 5) (1, 2) 
(6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) 
(10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms [\[ \binom{6}{3} \] = 20] 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1] 3-star.
- Node 5 forms [\[ \binom{6}{3} \] = 20] 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1] 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

List of unique 3-stars:
