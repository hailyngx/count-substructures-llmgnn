Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 22) (15, 25) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 21) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 29) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 27) (26, 12) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 19) (29, 12) (0, 23) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (2, 22) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 20) (25, 15) (25, 1) (25, 17) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (20, 21) (20, 16) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 10) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 11) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 16) (10, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (12, 3) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 29) (12, 11) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

For Node 3:
No 3-stars are formed with Node 3 as it only has exactly 3 neighbors.

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars are formed with Node 6. 
These 3-stars are: 
<6, (9, 7, 10)>, <6, (9, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 10, 8)>, <6, (7, 10, 8)>

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars are formed with Node 8. 
These 3-stars are:
<8, (23, 10, 12)>, <8, (23, 10, 0)>, <8, (23, 12, 0)>, <8, (10, 12, 0)>

Putting these numbers together, we have a total of [4 + 4] = 8 3-stars in the given graph.
