Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 4 neighbors for node 0. Thus, there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. These 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 11)>, <0, (3, 4, 14)>, <0, (3, 11, 14)>.

- Node 2: There are 6 neighbors for node 2. Thus, there are \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. These 3-stars are: <2, (3, 11, 12)>, <2, (3, 11, 14)>, <2, (3, 12, 14)>, <2, (3, 14, 10)>, <2, (6, 11, 12)>, <2, (6, 11, 13)>, <2, (6, 12, 13)>, <2, (6, 12, 3)>, <2, (6, 13, 3)>, <2, (6, 13, 11)>, <2, (6, 13, 14)>, <2, (11, 12, 14)>, <2, (11, 13, 14)>, <2, (11, 14, 10)>, <2, (12, 3, 14)>, <2, (12, 6, 13)>, <2, (13, 6, 11)>, <2, (14, 10, 13)>, <2, (14, 11, 13)>, <2, (14, 3, 10)>.

- Node 3: There are 6 neighbors for node 3. Thus, there are \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. These 3-stars are: <3, (0, 11, 12)>, <3, (0, 11, 14)>, <3, (0, 12, 14)>, <3, (0, 14, 10)>, <3, (2, 11, 12)>, <3, (2, 11, 14)>, <3, (2, 12, 14)>, <3, (2, 14, 10)>, <3, (6, 11, 12)>, <3, (6, 11, 13)>, <3, (6, 12, 13)>, <3, (6, 12, 2)>, <3, (6, 13, 14)>, <3, (6, 13, 2)>, <3, (11, 12, 14)>, <3, (11, 14, 10)>, <3, (12, 14, 2)>, <3, (13, 6, 11)>, <3, (14, 10, 13)>, <3, (14, 11, 13)>.

- Node 4: There are 4 neighbors for node 4. Thus, there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. These 3-stars are: <4, (0, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <4, (7, 6, 10)>, <4, (8, 2, 9)>.

- Node 6: There are 4 neighbors for node 6. Thus, there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. These 3-stars are: <6, (11, 12, 13)>, <6, (11, 13, 14)>, <6, (12, 13, 3)>, <6, (12, 3, 2)>.

- Node 7: There are 3 neighbors for node 7. As it has exactly 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star formed with node 7 as the center. This 3-star is: <7, (6, 10, 13)>.

- Node 8: There are 4 neighbors for node 8. Thus, there are \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. These 3-stars are: <8, (2, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 9, 2)>, <8, (9, 14, 4)>, <8, (9, 2, 14)>.

- Node 10: There are 5 neighbors for node 10. Thus, there are \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10 as the center. These 3-stars are: <10, (3, 5, 13)>, <10, (3, 14, 2)>, <10, (5, 13, 6)>, <10, (7, 6, 13)>, <10, (13, 14, 11)>, <10, (14, 11, 13)>, <10, (14, 3, 2)>, <10, (14, 3, 10)>, <10, (14, 6, 13)>, <10, (14, 6, 2)>.

- Node 11: There are 5 neighbors for node 11. Thus, there are \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the center. These 3-stars are: <11, (0, 6, 13)>, <11, (2, 13, 14)>, <11, (2, 14, 10)>, <11, (3, 13, 6)>, <11, (6, 13, 14)>, <11, (6, 3, 12)>, <11, (6, 12, 2)>, <11, (13, 14, 10)>, <11, (13, 3, 2)>, <11, (14, 10, 13)>.

- Node 13: There are 5 neighbors for node 13. Thus, there are \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the center. These 3-stars are: <13, (1, 5, 11)>, <13, (1, 6, 15)>, <13, (2, 11, 12)>, <13, (2, 6, 14)>, <13, (3, 6, 10)>, <13, (5, 10, 6)>, <13, (11, 14, 10)>, <13, (6, 14, 11)>, <13, (6, 14, 2)>, <13, (14, 2, 10)>.

- Node 14: There are 5 neighbors for node 14. Thus, there are \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the center. These 3-stars are: <14, (2, 10, 13)>, <14, (3, 10, 2)>, <14, (4, 8, 9)>, <14, (8, 9, 2)>, <14, (10, 13, 6)>, <14, (10, 13, 5)>, <14, (11, 13, 6)>, <14, (11, 13, 2)>, <14, (13, 6, 2)>, <14, (13, 6, 10)>.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars formed by all these nodes: 
\[ 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [83].
