Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 15) (16, 3) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 17) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (18, 8) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <0, (4, 7, 15)>
  - <0, (4, 11, 19)>
  - <0, (4, 15, 7)>
  - <0, (15, 7, 17)>
  
- Node 3:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <3, (1, 14, 16)>
  - <3, (1, 16, 2)>
  - <3, (14, 6, 17)>
  - <3, (16, 17, 15)>
  
- Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <4, (7, 13, 1)>
  - <4, (7, 12, 18)>
  - <4, (12, 2, 15)>
  - <4, (13, 10, 19)>
  
- Node 7:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <7, (4, 12, 2)>
  - <7, (4, 15, 0)>
  - <7, (11, 6, 14)>
  - <7, (12, 11, 0)>
  
- Node 10:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <10, (1, 13, 19)>
  - <10, (13, 4, 1)>
  - <10, (13, 19, 0)>
  - <10, (19, 9, 0)>
  
- Node 11:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <11, (0, 4, 15)>
  - <11, (6, 14, 17)>
  - <11, (7, 12, 18)>
  - <11, (12, 2, 15)>

- Node 12:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
  - <12, (2, 5, 18)>
  - <12, (2, 15, 0)>
  - <12, (5, 8, 18)>
  - <12, (5, 7, 11)>
  - <12, (7, 5, 11)>
  - <12, (7, 15, 0)>
  - <12, (8, 5, 18)>
  - <12, (11, 7, 18)>
  - <12, (15, 0, 2)>
  - <12, (18, 8, 5)>
  
- Node 13:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <13, (1, 4, 10)>
  - <13, (1, 10, 19)>
  - <13, (4, 7, 12)>
  - <13, (10, 1, 19)>
  
- Node 15:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
  - <15, (0, 7, 17)>
  - <15, (0, 2, 17)>
  - <15, (2, 12, 17)>
  - <15, (2, 17, 16)>
  - <15, (7, 11, 17)>
  - <15, (7, 0, 17)>
  - <15, (11, 7, 17)>
  - <15, (11, 6, 17)>
  - <15, (17, 16, 3)>
  - <15, (17, 16, 6)>
  
- Node 17:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
  - <17, (9, 15, 16)>
  - <17, (9, 16, 6)>
  - <17, (15, 7, 0)>
  - <17, (16, 3, 6)>
  
- Node 18:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <18, (8, 12, 5)>
  
- Node 19:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
  - <19, (9, 0, 10)>
  
Adding up all the 3-stars calculated from each node, we get a total of 46 3-stars. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
