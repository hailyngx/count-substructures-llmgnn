Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 0) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (17, 2) (0, 27) (0, 22) (2, 17) (2, 29) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 27) (29, 2) (29, 12) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 29) (12, 13) (12, 9) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 15) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 19) (25, 2) (25, 8) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 9) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 22) (6, 7) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 11) (19, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (9, 28) (9, 18) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 4) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 16) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (5, 24) (5, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 15, 27, 3, 1, 22, 23, 14, 0, 2, 29, 12, 26, 21, 28, 13, 24, 25, 18, 16, 6, 19, 9, 11, 20, and 10.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [49].

The unique 3-stars are:
<15, (27, 14, 28)>, <27, (15, 0, 29)>, <3, (6, 16, 18)>, <1, (26, 11, 4)>, <22, (23, 6, 0)>, <23, (27, 22, 9)>, <0, (27, 22, 7)>, <2, (17, 29, 10)>, <29, (27, 2, 12)>, <12, (29, 13, 9)>, <26, (1, 24, 20)>, <28, (15, 21, 19)>, <13, (12, 21, 11)>, <24, (26, 5, 10)>, <25, (2, 8, 18)>, <18, (3, 25, 9)>, <16, (3, 5, 20)>, <6, (3, 22, 7)>, <19, (28, 24, 11)>, <9, (23, 12, 28)>, <11, (1, 13, 19)>, <20, (7, 26, 16)>, <10, (2, 24, 19)>
