Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 17) (1, 15) (21, 3) (21, 13) (21, 8) (21, 5) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 0) (11, 3) (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 22) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (2, 27) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 17) (6, 4) (6, 14) (28, 8) (28, 0) (22, 9) (22, 16) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 10) (5, 21) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (14, 6) (14, 20) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 29) (10, 0) (10, 29) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 25) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 27) (24, 7) (24, 27) (29, 23) (29, 10) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 27) (25, 19) (25, 18) 

Response:
The node with the highest degree in this graph is node 9 with degree 4. Nodes 21, 8, 15, 19, 17, and 5 also have degree 4.

Applying the approach mentioned earlier, we first identify nodes with degree 3 or more, and then calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.

Nodes with degree 4: 9, 21, 8, 15, 19, 17, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 21: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 17: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<9, (18, 22, 26)>
<21, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 19, 21)>
<19, (15, 17, 25)>
<17, (12, 13, 5)>
<5, (13, 17, 21)>
