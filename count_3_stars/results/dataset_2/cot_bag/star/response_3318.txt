Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 1 = 45 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (2, 8, 18)>
- <0, (2, 13, 14)>

- <0, (5, 1, 13)>
- <0, (5, 17, 1)>
- <0, (5, 17, 0)>
- <0, (2, 14, 13)>

- <18, (8, 15, 15)>
- <18, (13, 14, 15)>
- <18, (13, 15, 15)>
