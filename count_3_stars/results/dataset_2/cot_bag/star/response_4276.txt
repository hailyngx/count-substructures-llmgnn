Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 4, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 7, 0
- Node 6: 9, 5, 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9, 3, 1
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 7, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are [42] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 4)>, <0, (5, 2, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, 
<5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 7, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, 
<6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (9, 8, 2)>, <6, (9, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 8, 4)>, <6, (5, 8, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 2)>, <6, (8, 4, 2)>, 
<7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 6)>, <7, (9, 1, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 6)>, 
<8, (9, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 2)>, 
<9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 6)>, <9, (7, 6, 0)>.
