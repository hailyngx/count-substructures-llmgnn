Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 18) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 6) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
3. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
4. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
5. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
7. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
9. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
11. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
12. Node 15: \( \binom{2}{0} = 1 \)
13. Node 16: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
14. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)
15. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
16. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these counts gives us a total of 54 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 13, 18)>, <1, (2, 8, 11)>, <1, (14, 19, 12)>, <1, (14, 19, 18)>, <2, (1, 7, 14)>, <3, (0, 13, 18)>, <4, (6, 10, 17)>, <7, (2, 5, 15)>, <7, (2, 10, 17)>, <7, (5, 11, 17)>, <7, (5, 10, 15)>, <7, (10, 16, 17)>, <10, (6, 7, 16)>, <11, (5, 17, 19)>, <14, (0, 13, 19)>, <14, (1, 18, 19)>.
