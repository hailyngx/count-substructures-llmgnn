Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 4) (14, 11) (0, 6) (0, 18) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 8, 13, 17, 4, 3, 11, 1, 15, 12, 7, 16, 18, and 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars formed.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars formed.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (12, 1, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 17, 0)>, <8, (13, 16, 17)>, <13, (8, 4, 15)>, <17, (6, 8, 10)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, <3, (5, 11, 16)>, <11, (17, 3, 14)>, <1, (5, 11, 15)>, <15, (13, 1, 7)>, <12, (5, 10, 18)>
