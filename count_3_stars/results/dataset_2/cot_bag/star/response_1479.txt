Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 16) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 19) (2, 1) (2, 12) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (6, 4) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (13, 12) (13, 9) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 14, 19, 12, and 18.

For node 3:
- Three neighbors: 15, 14, 10
- Number of 3-stars: 3

For node 14:
- Four neighbors: 3, 17, 1, 10, 19
- Number of 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

For node 19:
- Four neighbors: 14, 16, 12, 3
- Number of 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

For node 12:
- Five neighbors: 4, 2, 13, 18, 19
- Number of 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

For node 18:
- Three neighbors: 12, 9, 7
- Number of 3-stars: 3

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(3 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 3 = 24\)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 24.
Putting this number inside brackets: [24]

List of unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 15, 16)>
<14, (1, 19, 3)>
<19, (3, 12, 16)>
<12, (2, 13, 18)>
