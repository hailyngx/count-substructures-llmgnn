Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4

We can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 14 have degrees greater than or equal to 3, which means they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 80 \)

So, the final result is: [80]

The unique 3-stars found are:
