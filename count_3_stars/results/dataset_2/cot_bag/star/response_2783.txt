Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 15) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 11) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
Applying the rule for a 3-star graph to nodes with three or more neighbors, we find the following:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors <0, (2, 8, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors <1, (3, 19, 16)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors <2, (0, 11, 16)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors <3, (1, 4, 10)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors <4, (3, 8, 6)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors <6, (18, 4, 0)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors <7, (16, 19, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors <8, (2, 0, 11)>
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors <10, (3, 13, 4)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors <11, (2, 8, 15)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors <15, (12, 13, 11)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors <16, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors <17, (5, 18, 4)>
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors <19, (1, 7, 11)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 19, 16)>
<4, (3, 8, 6)>
<6, (18, 4, 0)>
<8, (2, 0, 11)>
<11, (2, 8, 15)>
<17, (5, 18, 4)>
<19, (1, 7, 11)>
