Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 17) (5, 9) (5, 19) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (18, 12) (22, 15) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 25) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 25) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 17) (0, 26) (0, 21) (0, 12) (20, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 28) (29, 4) (2, 12) (2, 27) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 7) (4, 29) (4, 27) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 4) (27, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 23) (1, 27) (1, 16) (1, 24) (12, 18) (12, 22) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 14) (24, 18) (24, 11) (24, 1) (3, 8) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 23) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 19) (15, 9) (15, 22) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 23) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 23) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in this graph which have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes. Let's go through each of them:

1. Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
2. Node 26: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
3. Node 5: \({{2}\choose{2}} = 1\)
4. Node 18: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
5. Node 22: \({{2}\choose{2}} = 1\)
6. Node 8: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
7. Node 13: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
8. Node 27: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
9. Node 12: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
10. Node 11: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
11. Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
12. Node 4: \({{1}\choose{1}} = 1\)
13. Node 16: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
14. Node 24: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
15. Node 21: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
16. Node 17: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
17. Node 23: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\)
18. Node 25: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
19. Node 14: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get:
\[ [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 41 \]

So, there are a total of 41 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them now:

<9, (5, 15, 13)>, <26, (18, 21, 0)>, <26, (18, 21, 17)>, <26, (18, 0, 17)>, <26, (21, 0, 17)>, <5, (9, 19, 21)>, <18, (26, 23, 24)>, <18, (26, 23, 12)>, <18, (26, 24, 12)>, <18, (23, 24, 12)>, <22, (15, 12, 2)>, <8, (13, 25, 11)>, <8, (13, 25, 3)>, <8, (25, 11, 3)>, <13, (9, 8, 25)>, <27, (20, 2, 4)>, <27, (20, 2, 1)>, <27, (20, 4, 1)>, <27, (2, 4, 1)>, <19, (5, 21, 14)>, <1, (27, 16, 24)>, <12, (18, 22, 0)>, <27, (20, 2, 4)>, <7, (11, 16, 6)>, <16, (10, 1, 14)>, <24, (18, 11, 1)>, <3, (8, 25, 11)>, <17, (26, 11, 23)>, <23, (18, 19, 17)>, <23, (18, 17, 25)>, <23, (19, 17, 25)>, <23, (17, 25, 14)>, <23, (17, 25, 25)>, <25, (8, 13, 10)>, <14, (19, 16, 23)>
