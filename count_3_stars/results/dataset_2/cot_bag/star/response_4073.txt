Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 10, there are 3 neighbors. Hence, there is 1 3-star.

For node 11, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 12, there are 5 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 14, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 16, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 17, there are 5 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 18, there are 4 neighbors. Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 19, there are 3 neighbors. Hence, there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 46 \).

Thus, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in the given graph.
