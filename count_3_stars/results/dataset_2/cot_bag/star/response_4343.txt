Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7

Let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 20 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 83 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 0)>
