Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 8) (3, 13) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 17) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 14) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 11) (0, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (16, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (6, 7, 12, 17)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <4, (6, 7, 12)>, <4, (6, 7, 17)>, <4, (6, 12, 17)>, <4, (7, 12, 17)>

2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (2, 9, 14, 15)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <5, (2, 9, 14)>, <5, (2, 9, 15)>, <5, (9, 14, 15)>

3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7, 9, 11)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 11)>, <6, (7, 9, 11)>, <6, (4, 9, 11)>

4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4, 6, 8, 14, 18)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 18)>, 
   <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 18)>, <7, (4, 14, 18)>, 
   <7, (6, 8, 14)>, <7, (6, 8, 18)>, 
   <7, (6, 14, 18)>, <7, (8, 14, 18)>

5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (5, 6, 11, 13)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (5, 6, 11)>, <9, (5, 6, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 13)>

6. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (1, 16, 17, 19)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

7. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (6, 9, 14, 19)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <11, (6, 9, 14)>, <11, (6, 9, 19)>, <11, (6, 14, 19)>, <11, (9, 14, 19)>

8. Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 9, 3)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <13, (0, 1, 9)>, <13, (0, 1, 3)>, <13, (0, 9, 3)>, <13, (1, 9, 3)>

9. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (5, 7, 11, 18)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <14, (5, 7, 11)>, <14, (5, 7, 18)>, <14, (5, 11, 18)>, <14, (7, 11, 18)>

10. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (4, 8, 10, 19)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

11. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (7, 14, 15, 18)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <18, (7, 14, 15)>, <18, (7, 14, 18)>, <18, (7, 15, 18)>, <18, (14, 15, 18)>

12. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (10, 11, 17, 19)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars:
\[ [ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 ] = [52] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
