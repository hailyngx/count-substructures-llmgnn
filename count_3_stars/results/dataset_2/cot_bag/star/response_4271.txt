Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Considering the number of neighbors for each node, we can find the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 67 \]

So, there are a total of 67 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
\[ [67] \]
