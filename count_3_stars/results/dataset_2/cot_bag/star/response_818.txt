Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 19) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 3) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 15) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
There are five nodes with three or more neighbors: node 11, node 2, node 14, node 18, and node 5.

For node 11:
- Neighbors: 16, 10, 18, 17
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <11, (16, 10, 18)>, <11, (16, 10, 17)>, <11, (16, 18, 17)>, <11, (10, 18, 17)>

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 16, 7, 14, 1, 17
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (16, 7, 14)>, <2, (16, 7, 1)>, <2, (16, 7, 17)>, <2, (16, 14, 1)>, <2, (16, 14, 17)>, <2, (16, 1, 17)>, <2, (7, 14, 1)>, <2, (7, 14, 17)>, <2, (7, 1, 17)>, <2, (14, 1, 17)>

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 0, 6, 1, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <14, (0, 6, 1)>, <14, (0, 6, 2)>, <14, (0, 1, 2)>, <14, (6, 1, 2)>

For node 18:
- Neighbors: 11, 8, 0, 6, 1
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <18, (11, 8, 0)>, <18, (11, 8, 6)>, <18, (11, 8, 1)>, <18, (11, 0, 6)>, <18, (11, 0, 1)>, <18, (11, 6, 1)>, <18, (8, 0, 6)>, <18, (8, 0, 1)>, <18, (8, 6, 1)>, <18, (0, 6, 1)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 6)>, <5, (7, 8, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
