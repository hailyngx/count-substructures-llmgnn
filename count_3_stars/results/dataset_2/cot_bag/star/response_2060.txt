Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each such node:

For node 0, it has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8, 2), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 2)>, <0, (1, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>

For node 1, it also has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8, 3), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 3)>, <1, (0, 8, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 8, 3)>, <1, (6, 8, 3)>

For node 4, it has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 8, 2), so there are no 3-stars formed with it.

For node 5, it has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 1, 3, 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 8, it has 5 neighbors (9, 1, 4, 7, 2), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with it:
<8, (9, 1, 4)>, <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 2)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>

For node 9, it has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 7, 6), so there are no 3-stars formed with it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, so the answer is [30].
