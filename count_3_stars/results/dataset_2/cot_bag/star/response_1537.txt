Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 1, 2, 6, and 12 with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes 0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 \times 8 + 10 \times 4 = 68 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 8, 13)>
- <1, (0, 8, 7)>
- <1, (0, 8, 2)>
- <1, (0, 13, 8)>
- <1, (0, 13, 7)>
- <1, (0, 13, 2)>
- <1, (1, 7, 13)>
- <1, (1, 7, 2)>
- <1, (7, 8, 13)>
- <1, (7, 8, 2)>
- <1, (7, 13, 2)>
- <2, (0, 7, 12)>
- <2, (0, 12, 6)>
- <2, (7, 12, 6)>
- <6, (0, 12, 14)>
