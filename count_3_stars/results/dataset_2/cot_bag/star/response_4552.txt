Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 19) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 16) (27, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 8) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 13) (28, 5) (13, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 29) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 23) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 29) (8, 18) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (16, 14) (16, 27) (16, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (24, 20) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 15) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 15) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 4) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 22) (15, 4) (15, 23) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 24) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 15) (5, 18) (5, 28) (25, 2) (25, 21) (25, 29) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 1: Degree 5
2. Node 3: Degree 3
3. Node 4: Degree 3
4. Node 6: Degree 4
5. Node 9: Degree 4
6. Node 11: Degree 4
7. Node 14: Degree 5
8. Node 15: Degree 5
9. Node 16: Degree 4
10. Node 17: Degree 3
11. Node 18: Degree 3
12. Node 19: Degree 3
13. Node 21: Degree 4
14. Node 22: Degree 4
15. Node 23: Degree 4
16. Node 24: Degree 3
17. Node 25: Degree 3
18. Node 26: Degree 3
19. Node 27: Degree 3
20. Node 28: Degree 5
21. Node 29: Degree 4

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 64 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 64 ([]).

The unique 3-stars are:
