Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 6) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 10) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 64 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (8, 13, 15)>, <3, (8, 16, 18)>, <6, (9, 10, 11)>, <7, (10, 16, 17)>, 
<9, (6, 10, 13)>, <10, (7, 12, 15)>, <13, (1, 6, 10)>, <14, (3, 9, 17)>, 
<15, (1, 10, 19)>, <16, (3, 7, 18)>, <17, (4, 7, 18)>, <18, (12, 16, 17)>, 
<19, (5, 12, 15)>
