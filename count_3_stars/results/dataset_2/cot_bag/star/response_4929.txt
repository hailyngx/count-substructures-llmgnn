Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 16) (17, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- For node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 11: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 16: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars = \(0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34\)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 13, 15>
<2, 12, 14>
<3, 4, 16>
<4, 11, 18>
<4, 13, 15>
<4, 19, 14>
<6, 10, 11>
<7, 12, 16>
<8, 13, 1>
<9, 14, 2>
<9, 14, 19>
<9, 19, 10>
