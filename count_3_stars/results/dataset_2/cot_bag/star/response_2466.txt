Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0: 3 neighbors  
- Node 2: 5 neighbors  
- Node 3: 4 neighbors  
- Node 4: 4 neighbors  
- Node 5: 4 neighbors  
- Node 7: 4 neighbors  
- Node 8: 3 neighbors  
- Node 9: 5 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:  
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer is [28].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<2, (3, 7, 9)>  
<3, (0, 1, 5)>  
<4, (0, 3, 6)>  
<5, (3, 4, 9)>  
<7, (2, 6, 9)>  
<8, (1, 5, 9)>  
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
