Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 6) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 17) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 14) (8, 10) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 17) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 18) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 0) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: 9, 13, 2, 14
2: 6, 12, 1, 14
3: 16, 7, 13, 19, 0
4: 18, 0
5: 17
6: 16, 9, 2
7: 3, 17
8: 10, 13
9: 6, 18, 1
10: 0, 8, 14
11: 16, 17
12: 2, 13, 19
13: 8, 12, 3, 1
14: 10, 2, 1
15: 16, 18
16: 11, 3, 15, 6
17: 11, 7, 5, 18
18: 4, 9, 15, 17
19: 3, 12

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
4. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
6. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
