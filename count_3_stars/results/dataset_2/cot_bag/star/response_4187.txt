Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 5) (7, 11) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (18, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 38 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (3, 4, 15)>
<3, (0, 14, 6)>
<4, (0, 14, 15)>
<5, (19, 10, 11)>
<6, (3, 19, 10)>
<8, (14, 17, 9)>
<9, (16, 15, 8)>
<10, (6, 5, 12)>
<11, (7, 13, 16)>
<12, (1, 2, 10)>
<13, (19, 1, 16)>
<14, (8, 17, 4)>
<16, (9, 11, 13)>
<19, (6, 13, 5)>
