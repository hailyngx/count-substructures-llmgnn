Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 5, 3, 8
- Node 2: 9, 6, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 1, 7, 4
- Node 4: 6, 3, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 8, 1, 0
- Node 6: 9, 7, 3, 4, 2
- Node 7: 9, 6, 3, 0
- Node 8: 5, 9, 1, 4, 2
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 2, 7

Let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, 8. <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 3, 8. <4, (6, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, 3. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, 4. <8, (5, 1, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, 2. <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
