Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 9) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) 

Response:
To start constructing the 3-star graph, let's first map out the nodes with their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 12, 13, and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 0, 14, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 10, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 8, 4, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 12, 10, 9, and 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 3, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 13, 8, 4, and 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 13, and 3.
- Node 11 is connected to node 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 2, 11, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 10, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 4, and 2.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed by each central node:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [0]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1, (0, 5, 9), (0, 6, 14), (0, 14, 4)]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [2, (0, 14, 6), (0, 6, 7)]
- Node 7: [2, (5, 7, 13), (7, 9, 13), (6, 7, 12)]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [1, (1, 2, 9), (9, 7, 13), (4, 9, 14)]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [0]
- Node 12: [1, (2, 12, 13), (6, 7, 12)]
- Node 13: [1, (2, 12, 13), (5, 7, 13), (2, 9, 13)]
- Node 14: [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 0] = [16].

Therefore, there are 16 unique 3-stars in the provided graph, which are:
<0>
<(0, 5, 9)>
<(0, 6, 14)>
<(0, 14, 4)>
<(0, 14, 6)>
<(0, 6, 7)>
<(5, 7, 13)>
<(7, 9, 13)>
<(6, 7, 12)>
<(1, 2, 9)>
<(9, 7, 13)>
<(4, 9, 14)>
<(2, 12, 13)>
<(5, 7, 13)>
<(2, 9, 13)>
