Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 17) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (22, 15) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 4) (23, 25) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 20) (11, 22) (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 25) (24, 19) (26, 27) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 17) (21, 9) (21, 11) (21, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 29) (19, 24) (19, 1) (16, 0) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 26) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 26) (1, 27) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 20) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 1) (14, 28) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 14) (25, 23) (25, 11) (25, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 20, 21, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars formed: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, 3, 26>, <0, 5, 10>, <0, 16, 18>, <0, 18, 1>, <0, 18, 8>, <1, 18, 8>, <1, 18, 20>, <5, 0, 16>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 10, 20>, <5, 10, 4>, <9, 6, 13>, <9, 6, 17>, <9, 13, 14>, <9, 13, 6>, <11, 22, 15>, <11, 25, 4>, <11, 25, 22>, <11, 25, 29>, <11, 26, 17>, <13, 14, 28>, <17, 15, 22>, <17, 15, 26>, <18, 0, 3>, <18, 0, 27>, <20, 1, 27>, <26, 17, 15>, <26, 17, 6>, <26, 3, 0>, <26, 3, 12>, <28, 2, 8>, <28, 7, 10>, <28, 7, 12>, <28, 14, 13>, <29, 5, 0>, <29, 5, 11> 

Final answer: [38]
