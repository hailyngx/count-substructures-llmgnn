Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 16) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 0) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 25) (21, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (24, 17) (24, 1) (26, 12) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 29) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 20) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 12) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 11) (14, 28) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 19) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 27) (16, 23) (16, 8) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars from each node, we have: 
1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (8, 16, 29)>
<1, (5, 10, 24)>
<3, (5, 17, 18)>
<5, (1, 3, 13)>
<7, (10, 15, 23)>
<8, (0, 16, 23)>
<9, (10, 12, 16)>
<10, (1, 7, 17)>
<12, (9, 20, 28)>
<13, (5, 20, 25)>
<15, (7, 9, 23)>
<17, (3, 10, 24)>
<20, (9, 12, 13)>
<22, (5, 18, 23)>
<23, (7, 8, 15)>
<25, (13, 19, 28)>
<27, (7, 17, 19)>
<28, (12, 20, 25)>
