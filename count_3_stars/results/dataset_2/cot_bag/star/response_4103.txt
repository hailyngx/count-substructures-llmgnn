Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 1) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 7) (17, 4) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 18) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31 \)

Therefore, there are 31 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [31].
