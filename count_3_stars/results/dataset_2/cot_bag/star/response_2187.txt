Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <0, (23, 18, 15)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <1, (25, 6, 4)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <3, (25, 6, 24)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <6, (3, 23, 28)>, <6, (4, 27, 28)>, <6, (1, 4, 27)>, <6, (1, 27, 28)>, <6, (1, 23, 27)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <8, (23, 28, 15)>, <8, (20, 27, 15)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <9, (18, 16, 19)>
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <10, (2, 23, 27)>
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <11, (22, 4, 21)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <12, (13, 16, 1)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <13, (17, 19, 12)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <14, (29, 26, 27)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <15, (8, 26, 0)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <16, (9, 26, 12)>
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <19, (22, 13, 24)>
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient to form a 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <22, (19, 11, 21)>
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <23, (8, 6, 10)>
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <24, (3, 19, 21)>
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient to form a 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <26, (14, 15, 16)>
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <27, (4, 14, 20)>
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
  - The 3-star is:
    - <28, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The 3-stars are:
    - <29, (2, 7, 14)>

There are a total of 53 unique 3-stars in this graph.
