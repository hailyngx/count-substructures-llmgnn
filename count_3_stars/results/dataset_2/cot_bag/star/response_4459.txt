Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 15) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 0) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 20) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 13) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 16) (22, 4) (22, 14) (6, 13) (6, 24) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 12) (3, 23) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 22) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 1) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (1, 27) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 1) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 1) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 28) (15, 21) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 18) (20, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
10. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
14. Node 24: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
15. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
16. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
17. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star
18. Node 29: \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 53 \)

Therefore, there are 53 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [53].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 23, 20)>, <4, (18, 27, 20)>, <5, (17, 29, 28)>, <7, (21, 12, 15)>, <8, (2, 10, 29)>, <10, (2, 26, 12)>, <12, (21, 25, 1)>, <13, (18, 25, 6)>, <18, (4, 13, 20)>, <19, (17, 28, 5)>, <20, (4, 18, 6)>, <21, (7, 15, 28)>, <22, (16, 14, 4)>, <24, (6, 9, 4)>, <26, (13, 10, 27)>, <27, (26, 1, 18)>, <28, (19, 15, 5)>, <29, (8, 19, 5)>.
