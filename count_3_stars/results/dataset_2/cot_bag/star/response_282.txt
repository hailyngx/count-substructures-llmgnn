Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Let's first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, and 6 (degree 4)
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (degree 6)
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 5, 7, and 8 (degree 4)
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9 (degree 5)
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 (degree 5)
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, and 4 (degree 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 4, and 7 (degree 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
