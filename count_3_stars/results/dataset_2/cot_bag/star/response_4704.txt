Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 5) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 1) (7, 6) (7, 17) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up gives a total of 47 3-stars. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (4, 5, 17)>, <3, (1, 7, 14)>, <4, (1, 5, 14)>, <9, (2, 15, 16)>, <10, (11, 13, 15)>, <11, (10, 12, 13)>, <13, (0, 10, 11)>, <14, (0, 2, 5)>, <15, (9, 10, 16)>.
