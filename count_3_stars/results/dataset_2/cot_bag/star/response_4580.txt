Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  
Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed at each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
13. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
14. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
15. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
16. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
17. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
18. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
19. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \(1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (13, 1, 19)>, <3, (16, 12, 3)>, <4, (17, 10, 4)>, <5, (18, 5, 19)>, <6, (18, 6, 2)>, <8, (8, 15, 5)>, <10, (13, 10, 17)>, <11, (11, 14, 1)>, <13, (1, 13, 14)>, <14, (0, 14, 9)>, <15, (15, 6, 7)>, <16, (16, 3, 8)>, <17, (17, 3, 4)>, <18, (5, 18, 6)>, <19, (1, 19, 5)>.
