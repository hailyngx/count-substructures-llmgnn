Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3

We need to consider the nodes with degree 3 or more to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 10, 13)>
<10, (4, 11, 12)>
<12, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 12)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<11, (4, 10, 13)>
