Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To start, we need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, the degrees of each node are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these together: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 = 30

So, the final answer is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- Unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 4)>
