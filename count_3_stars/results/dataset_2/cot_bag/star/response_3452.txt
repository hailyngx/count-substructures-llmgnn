Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 4) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 8) (22, 2) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 20) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 6) (28, 4) (28, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 27) (15, 4) (15, 6) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 0) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 29) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 18) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 20) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 1) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 12) (27, 10) (27, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 0) (29, 11) (29, 5) (29, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 4, 7, 18, 5, 13, 24, 26, 28, 8, 9, 15, 21, 2, 17, 25, 6, 19, 20, 0, 27, 12, 29.

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all these 3-stars up, we get a total of 49 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars are:
