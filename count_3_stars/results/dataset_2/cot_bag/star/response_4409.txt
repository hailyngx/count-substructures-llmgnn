Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (0, 10) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 23) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 18) (23, 7) (23, 8) (23, 14) (2, 14) (18, 6) (18, 25) (18, 29) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 5) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 18) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 24) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 4) (19, 22) (19, 20) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 16) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 14) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (3, 26) (3, 4) (16, 20) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 14) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify the 3-stars that can be formed:

From node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<1, (13, 8, 15)>
<1, (13, 7, 24)>
<1, (13, 1, 14)>
<1, (13, 24, 1)>

From node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<4, (26, 12, 15)>
<4, (26, 1, 3)>
<4, (26, 24, 5)>
<4, (12, 21, 4)>

From node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<6, (9, 7, 17)>
<6, (9, 18, 25)>
<6, (9, 21, 17)>
<6, (9, 17, 29)>

From node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<7, (21, 12, 17)>
<7, (21, 17, 29)>
<7, (21, 6, 17)>
<7, (21, 1, 14)>

From node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<8, (13, 9, 26)>
<8, (13, 23, 14)>
<8, (13, 23, 7)>
<8, (13, 26, 8)>

From node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<9, (26, 12, 21)>
<9, (26, 6, 17)>
<9, (26, 5, 24)>
<9, (26, 3, 4)>

From node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<13, (22, 19, 20)>
<13, (22, 8, 15)>
<13, (22, 1, 14)>
<13, (22, 8, 23)>

From node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<15, (13, 4, 14)>

From node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<17, (27, 6, 29)>
<17, (27, 21, 7)>
<17, (27, 21, 12)>
<17, (27, 29, 24)>

From node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<21, (7, 12, 17)>
<21, (7, 17, 29)>
<21, (7, 6, 17)>
<21, (7, 1, 14)>

From node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
<22, (13, 19, 20)>

From node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<24, (26, 29, 24)>
<24, (26, 4, 5)>
<24, (26, 1, 24)>
<24, (26, 5, 24)>

From node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<26, (9, 24, 26)>
<26, (9, 3, 4)>
<26, (9, 5, 24)>
<26, (9, 12, 21)>

From node 27: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<27, (25, 5, 24)>
<27, (25, 10, 16)>
<27, (25, 27, 10)>
<27, (25, 18, 29)>

From node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<29, (18, 17, 24)>
<29, (18, 27, 29)>
<29, (18, 6, 25)>
<29, (18, 28, 29)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
