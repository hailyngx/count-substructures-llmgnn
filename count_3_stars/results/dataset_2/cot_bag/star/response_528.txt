Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 12
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 10
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 10, 11, 13
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9, 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10, 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 12, 14
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9, 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 9, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (4, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (0, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 10, 13)>
<5, (0, 2, 12)>
