Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 4, 7, 14, 17, 10, 8, 18, 12, 2, 16, 6, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
2. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star
3. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
4. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
5. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
7. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
8. Node 12 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star
9. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
10. Node 16 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
11. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
12. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 34.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 16, 17)>
<14, (17, 3, 6)>
<17, (14, 4, 9)>
<10, (3, 6, 12)>
<8, (5, 16, 18)>
<8, (11, 2, 18)>
<8, (18, 0, 16)>
<8, (16, 0, 9)>
<2, (9, 11, 18)>
<2, (11, 1, 15)>
<2, (15, 13, 6)>
<16, (0, 8, 18)>
<16, (8, 0, 9)>
<16, (9, 17, 19)>
<6, (0, 1, 15)>
<6, (1, 11, 8)>
<6, (10, 14, 15)>
<6, (15, 2, 13)>
<6, (6, 10, 1)>
<9, (2, 16, 17)> 

So, the final answer is [34].
