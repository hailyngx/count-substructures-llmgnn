Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
Node 0: 1, 9, 14
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 14
Node 2: 1, 5, 11
Node 3: 4, 11, 12
Node 4: 3, 9, 12
Node 5: 2, 7, 9, 12
Node 6: 1, 10, 11
Node 7: 5, 8, 10, 12, 14
Node 8: 1, 7, 9, 11, 12
Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13
Node 10: 6, 7, 11, 14
Node 11: 2, 3, 6, 8, 10
Node 12: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 13: 9
Node 14: 0, 1, 7, 10

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 12 have at least three neighbors.
- For each of these nodes, the number of 3-stars is calculated as follows:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 61 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
