Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 17) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 19), (1, 18)
Node 2: (9, 2), (7, 2), (2, 14)
Node 3: (6, 3), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 10)
Node 4: (11, 4), (15, 4)
Node 5: (5, 19), (5, 7)
Node 6: (11, 6), (6, 3), (6, 12)
Node 7: (0, 7), (5, 7), (7, 3), (7, 14), (7, 2)
Node 8: (11, 8), (8, 10), (8, 12)
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 19)
Node 10: (3, 10), (8, 10), (10, 9), (10, 18), (10, 14)
Node 11: (11, 6), (11, 8), (11, 4), (17, 11)
Node 12: (6, 12), (0, 12), (12, 8)
Node 14: (7, 14), (2, 14), (15, 14), (14, 10)
Node 15: (15, 16), (15, 4), (15, 14)
Node 17: (11, 17), (13, 17), (17, 19)
Node 18: (1, 18), (18, 10)
Node 19: (5, 19), (9, 19), (19, 1), (19, 17)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [2]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [3]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]
Node 9: [1]
Node 10: [1]
Node 11: [3]
Node 12: [1]
Node 14: [1]
Node 15: [1]
Node 17: [1]
Node 18: [1]
Node 19: [1]

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get [20]. 

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (3, 1, 19)>
<2, (9, 2, 14)>
<3, (6, 3, 12)>
<4, (11, 4, 15)>
<5, (5, 19, 7)>
<6, (11, 6, 12)>
<7, (0, 7, 14)>
<8, (11, 8, 12)>
<9, (9, 2, 14)>
<10, (3, 10, 8)>
<11, (11, 6, 12)>
<12, (0, 12, 6)>
<13, (11, 13, 17)>
<14, (15, 14, 4)>
<15, (7, 14, 2)>
<16, (15, 4, 14)>
<17, (11, 17, 13)>
<18, (1, 18, 10)>
<19, (19, 1, 17)>
