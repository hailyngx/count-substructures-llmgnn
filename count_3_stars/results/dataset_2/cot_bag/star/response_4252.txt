Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 16) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 2) (12, 17) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 17) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 18) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 12, 19, 10, 0.  
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (0, 12, 19)>, <2, (0, 12, 10)>, <2, (0, 19, 10)>, <2, (12, 19, 10)>, <2, (12, 19, 10)> 

2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 18, 1, 15, 18.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-star configurations: <4, (18, 1, 15)> 

3. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 14, 9.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-star configurations: <7, (9, 10, 14)>

4. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 18, 11, 7, 9.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-star configurations: <9, (6, 18, 11)>, <9, (6, 18, 7)>, <9, (6, 18, 9)>, <9, (6, 11, 7)>, <9, (6, 11, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (18, 11, 7)>, <9, (18, 11, 9)>, <9, (18, 7, 9)>, <9, (11, 7, 9)> 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 28 \)

Final answer: There are 28 3-stars in the given graph.
