Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 29) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 8) (8, 16) (8, 25) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 20) (13, 28) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 28) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 28) (26, 12) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 29) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 20) (20, 13) (20, 26) (20, 17) (4, 14) (4, 21) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 22) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 19) (5, 18) (5, 10) (19, 23) (19, 0) (6, 25) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 15) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 22) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 22) (14, 7) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 15) (24, 23) (24, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 24) (0, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 0) (7, 14) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 5) (28, 13) (28, 27) (28, 1) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4,
- Node 1 has degree 4,
- Node 2 has degree 5,
- Node 3 has degree 2,
- Node 4 has degree 3,
- Node 5 has degree 2,
- Node 6 has degree 3,
- Node 7 has degree 1,
- Node 8 has degree 3,
- Node 9 has degree 2,
- Node 10 has degree 3,
- Node 11 has degree 2,
- Node 12 has degree 2,
- Node 13 has degree 4,
- Node 14 has degree 4,
- Node 15 has degree 4,
- Node 16 has degree 4,
- Node 17 has degree 4,
- Node 18 has degree 3,
- Node 19 has degree 2,
- Node 20 has degree 3,
- Node 21 has degree 4,
- Node 22 has degree 4,
- Node 23 has degree 4,
- Node 24 has degree 2,
- Node 25 has degree 3,
- Node 26 has degree 4,
- Node 27 has degree 2,
- Node 28 has degree 3,
- Node 29 has degree 3.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Number of 3-stars on nodes with degree 4: \( \binom{5}{3} \) + \( \binom{4}{3} \) + \( \binom{4}{3} \) + \( \binom{4}{3} \) + \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Number of 3-stars on nodes with degree 3: \( \binom{5}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{4}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21

Adding these up, we have a total of 26 + 21 = 47 3-stars in this graph.  

Therefore, the answer is [47].  

And the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<16, (17, 8, 25)>, 
<21, (2, 13, 22)>,
<14, (4, 23, 7)>,
<1, (12, 6, 28)>,
<29, (3, 22, 26)>,
<0, (19, 6, 15)>.
