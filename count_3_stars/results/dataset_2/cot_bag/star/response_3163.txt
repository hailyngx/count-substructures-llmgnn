Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <0, (1, 7, 10)>, <0, (1, 7, 13)>, <0, (1, 7, 10)>, <0, (7, 10, 13)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <2, (5, 11, 18)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 10)>, <5, (4, 6, 10)>, <5, (4, 6, 10)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <7, (0, 11, 13)>, <7, (0, 11, 15)>, <7, (0, 13, 15)>, <7, (0, 13, 15)>, <7, (11, 13, 15)>, 
    <7, (11, 13, 15)>, <7, (13, 15, 14)>, <7, (13, 15, 14)>, <7, (13, 14, 19)>, <7, (13, 14, 19)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <8, (10, 11, 17)>, <8, (10, 11, 17)>, <8, (10, 11, 15)>, <8, (11, 15, 17)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <10, (0, 3, 5)>, <10, (0, 3, 8)>, <10, (3, 5, 8)>, <10, (3, 5, 8)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <11, (2, 7, 15)>, <11, (7, 15, 17)>, <11, (7, 15, 17)>, <11, (7, 15, 17)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <13, (0, 7, 12)>, <13, (0, 7, 12)>, <13, (7, 12, 14)>, <13, (7, 12, 14)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <15, (4, 7, 11)>, <15, (4, 7, 16)>, <15, (4, 7, 16)>, <15, (4, 7, 16)>, 
    <15, (7, 11, 16)>, <15, (7, 11, 16)>, <15, (11, 16, 17)>, <15, (11, 16, 17)>, 
    <15, (16, 17, 18)>, <15, (16, 17, 18)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    <18, (2, 15, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [46]
