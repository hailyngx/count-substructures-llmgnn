Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars (degree less than 3)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: No 3-stars (degree less than 3)
- Node 11: No 3-stars (degree less than 3)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 12, 13)>
<5, (9, 10, 12)>
<6, (4, 12, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 10, 14)>
<10, (5, 9, 7)>
<12, (4, 5, 14)>
<13, (4, 6, 14)>
<14, (6, 9, 12)>
