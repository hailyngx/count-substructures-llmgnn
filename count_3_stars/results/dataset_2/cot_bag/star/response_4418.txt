Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
<0, (7, 12, 16)>
<0, (7, 12, 0)>
<0, (7, 16, 0)>
<0, (12, 16, 0)>

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
<1, (5, 9, 13)>
<1, (1, 13, 9)>
<1, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (1, 5, 13)>

Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
<2, (8, 11, 17)>
<2, (2, 11, 17)>
<2, (2, 8, 11)>
<2, (2, 8, 17)>

Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
<3, (2, 4, 10)>

Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
<4, (10, 13, 3)>

Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
<5, (6, 15, 1)>

Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
<7, (0, 12, 17)>
<7, (0, 12, 7)>
<7, (0, 17, 7)>
<7, (12, 17, 7)>

Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
<9, (1, 13, 14)>
<9, (1, 13, 9)>
<9, (1, 14, 9)>
<9, (13, 14, 9)>

Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
<13, (1, 9, 13)>
<13, (1, 9, 12)>
<13, (1, 13, 12)>
<13, (9, 13, 12)>

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 27.
