Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:

(5) --- (0)
 |  \   /  |
 |   \ /   |
(3) --- (1) --- (8)
 |  / | \  |   /
 | /  |  \ |  /
(7) --- (4) --- (2) --- (6)
     \   |  /
      \  | /
       (9)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (5, 8, 6, 9, 8). Therefore, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0 at the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (4, 7, 6, 3, 8). Therefore, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 2 at the center.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors and thus cannot form any 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 10] = 20

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 4)>
<2, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (7, 4, 3)>
