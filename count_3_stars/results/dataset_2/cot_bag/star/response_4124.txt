Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with less than 3 neighbors, so they won't form any 3-stars.

Let's check each of the remaining 9 nodes to see if they can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (6, 4, 12). There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (9, 4, 14, 7, 13). There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (6, 4, 8, 3). There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (9, 10, 2, 12, 13). There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0, 2, 1). There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8, 10, 8). There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (10, 2, 0). There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (11, 14, 1, 13). There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (5, 11, 2, 14). There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Adding them up, there are a total of [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 32 3-stars.
The 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (6, 4, 12)>, 
<1, (9, 4, 14)>, 
<1, (9, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (9, 4, 13)>, 
<1, (4, 14, 7)>, 
<1, (4, 14, 13)>, 
<1, (14, 7, 13)>, 
<1, (9, 7, 13)>, 
<1, (4, 14, 13)>, 
<2, (6, 4, 3)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 3)>, 
<2, (6, 3, 13)>, 
<2, (4, 8, 3)>, 
<2, (4, 3, 13)>, 
<3, (9, 10, 13)>, 
<3, (9, 12, 13)>, 
<3, (10, 2, 13)>, 
<3, (2, 12, 13)>, 
<4, (6, 0, 2)>, 
<4, (6, 0, 1)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 1)>, 
<7, (11, 14, 13)>, 
<7, (11, 1, 13)>, 
<7, (14, 1, 13)>, 
<8, (5, 11, 14)>, 
<8, (5, 2, 14)>, 
<8, (11, 2, 14)>, 
<9, (5, 10, 8)>, 
<9, (5, 10, 8)>, 
<10, (6, 2, 0)>, 
<13, (10, 3, 7)>, 
<13, (3, 7, 12)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
