Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 12) (14, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (10, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 7, 8, and 12.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (8, 12, 16)>
<3, (5, 13, 15)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 13)>
<3, (2, 5, 15)>
<3, (2, 15, 5)>
<7, (12, 15, 18)>
<7, (7, 15, 17)>
<7, (3, 5, 15)>
<7, (3, 13, 19)>
<8, (1, 16, 3)>
<8, (1, 12, 7)>
<8, (8, 16, 17)>
<8, (8, 1, 12)>
<12, (1, 7, 11)>
<12, (4, 7, 12)>
<12, (4, 12, 9)>
<12, (7, 12, 1)>
