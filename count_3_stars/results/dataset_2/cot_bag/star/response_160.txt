Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7
Node 1: 2, 5, 8
Node 2: 1, 6, 8
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Looking at the nodes, we see that nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have at least 3 neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 0: inom{3}{3}  = 1 3-star
Node 5: inom{5}{3}  = 10 3-stars
Node 6: inom{6}{3}  = 20 3-stars
Node 7: inom{5}{3}  = 10 3-stars
Node 8: inom{6}{3}  = 20 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 61, so we write this as [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
