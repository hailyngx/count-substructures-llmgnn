Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 14, 7, 10, 3
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 6, 2, 14, 10, 1, 13
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 0, 3
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 3, 2
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 11, 0
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 10, 13
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 2, 12, 13
Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 13, 14
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 7, 13, 5
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 3, 12
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 12
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 14
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 9, 1, 0, 10, 3

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors.

For nodes 6, 9, 10, and 13:
\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are <6, (9, 14, 10)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 13)>, <3, (4, 13, 5)>, <3, (7, 13, 5)>, <5, (1, 11, 12)>, <1, (5, 10, 13)>, <0, (2, 12, 13)>, <10, (1, 13, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [50].
