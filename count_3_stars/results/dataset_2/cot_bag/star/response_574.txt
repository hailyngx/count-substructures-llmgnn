Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 25) (14, 13) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 3) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 26) (23, 0) (23, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 12) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 11) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 18) (26, 8) (26, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 25) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 2) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 29) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 1) (19, 23) (19, 24) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (7, 14) (7, 20) (7, 5) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 29) (29, 22) (29, 24) (29, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (3, 27) 

Response:
The node degrees can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 4

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the rule described earlier. We find that the total number of 3-stars is [105].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 16, 1)>
<1, (4, 16, 18)>
<16, (4, 6, 21)>
<11, (15, 2, 28)>
<7, (14, 20, 5)>
<12, (20, 21, 29)>
<20, (12, 7, 15)>
<21, (12, 16, 5)>
<15, (22, 11, 20)>
<5, (7, 21, 25)>
<25, (8, 21, 22)>
<26, (8, 10, 25)>
<10, (13, 2, 26)>
<24, (17, 19, 29)>
<8, (9, 25, 26)>
<9, (6, 18, 8)>
<0, (23, 27, 3)>
<23, (0, 19, 27)>
<19, (23, 24, 29)>
<27, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (27, 4, 23)>
