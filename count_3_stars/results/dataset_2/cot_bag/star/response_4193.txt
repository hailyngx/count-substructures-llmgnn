Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 0) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (19, 15) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 18) (2, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 6) 

Response:
By examining the given edges, we can construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges as described. 

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, and 18. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 35 3-stars in the graph: \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [35] \).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <3, 6, 9>
- <12, 3, 15>
- <12, 3, 6>
- <12, 3, 9>
- <12, 16, 18>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 4, 15>
- <7, 1, 14>
- <7, 13, 17>
- <8, 0, 17>
- <8, 5, 11>
- <8, 5, 13>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <8, 11, 9>
- <8, 13, 17>
- <8, 13, 10>
- <8, 13, 18>
- <8, 13, 17>
- <8, 13, 10>
- <8, 13, 18>
- <13, 10, 18>
- <16, 0, 17>
- <16, 0, 8>
- <16, 0, 12>
- <16, 9, 18>
- <17, 0, 8>
- <17, 7, 13>
- <17, 7, 13>
- <17, 13, 8>
- <18, 6, 16>
