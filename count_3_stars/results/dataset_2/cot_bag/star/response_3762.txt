Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 4) (13, 16) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 15) (5, 1) (5, 17) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 15) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 9) (9, 12) (9, 17) (9, 14) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participates in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 17, 19)>
<1, (5, 10, 14)>
<2, (7, 15, 17)>
<3, (6, 10, 19)>
<4, (8, 11, 13)>
<6, (3, 10, 12)>
<9, (12, 14, 17)>
<10, (1, 3, 18)>
<12, (9, 15, 16)>
<15, (11, 12, 16)>
<16, (13, 15, 17)>
<17, (0, 5, 16)>
<19, (0, 12, 16)>
