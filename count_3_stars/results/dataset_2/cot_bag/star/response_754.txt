Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have 3 neighbors each.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 0): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - We have <0, (7, 12, 2)>, <0, (7, 12, 3)>, <0, (7, 2, 14)>, <0, (12, 2, 14)>

- For nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
  - We have <2, (6, 0, 14)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 13)>, <7, (4, 0, 13)>, <8, (5, 11, 12)>, <9, (4, 14, 12)>, <11, (8, 1, 14)>, <12, (4, 8, 14)>, <13, (5, 7, 6)>, <14, (9, 13, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
