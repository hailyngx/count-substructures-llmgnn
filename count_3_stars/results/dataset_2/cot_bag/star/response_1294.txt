Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 27) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 18) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 8) (21, 6) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 12) (12, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (5, 28) (5, 12) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 28) (19, 13) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 3) (17, 6) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 20) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 7) (20, 23) (20, 7) (24, 8) (24, 0) (0, 24) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 55 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [55]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, 9, 10>, <1, 9, 23>, <1, 9, 25>, <1, 10, 15>, <1, 10, 23>, <1, 10, 25>, <1, 10, 9>, <1, 15, 19>, <1, 15, 23>, <1, 15, 10>, <1, 19, 15>, <1, 19, 22>, <1, 19, 27>, <1, 22, 19>, <3, 17, 6>, <3, 17, 25>, <3, 17, 26>, <3, 6, 17>, <3, 6, 21>, <3, 6, 25>, <3, 6, 29>, <3, 21, 6>, <3, 25, 6>, <3, 25, 10>, <3, 25, 17>, <3, 25, 29>, <3, 29, 6>, <3, 29, 25>, <3, 29, 28>, <3, 29, 5>, <8, 1, 10>, <8, 1, 11>, <8, 1, 21>, <8, 1, 23>, <8, 8, 1>, <8, 8, 11>, <8, 8, 21>, <8, 8, 24>, <8, 8, 23>, <8, 11, 1>, <8, 11, 8>, <8, 11, 14>, <8, 11,...
