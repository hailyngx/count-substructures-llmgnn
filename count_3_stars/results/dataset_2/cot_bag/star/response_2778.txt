Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- (0, 1), (0, 16), (0, 25)
- (1, 0), (1, 17), (1, 27)
- (2, 3), (2, 9), (2, 19), (2, 29)
- (3, 2), (3, 15), (3, 23)
- (4, 7), (4, 24)
- (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 21), (5, 24)
- (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 20)
- (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 24)
- (8, 7), (8, 16), (8, 26)
- (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 17), (9, 25), (9, 28)
- (10, 11), (10, 20), (10, 27)
- (11, 9), (11, 10), (11, 15), (11, 27)
- (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 22), (12, 27)
- (13, 6), (13, 5)
- (14, 17), (14, 25)
- (15, 3), (15, 11), (15, 24), (15, 25)
- (16, 0), (16, 8)
- (17, 1), (17, 9), (17, 14), (17, 29)
- (18, 29)
- (19, 2), (19, 21), (19, 26), (19, 29)
- (20, 6), (20, 10), (20, 26)
- (21, 5), (21, 19)
- (22, 12)
- (23, 3), (23, 28)
- (24, 4), (24, 5), (24, 7), (24, 15)
- (25, 9), (25, 14), (25, 15), (25, 0)
- (26, 8), (26, 19), (26, 20)
- (27, 1), (27, 10), (27, 11), (27, 12)
- (28, 9), (28, 23)
- (29, 2), (29, 17), (29, 18)

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {2, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29}

Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{10}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 120 + 220 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 394

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [394].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<2, (3, 9, 29)>, <9, (2, 11, 17)>, <11, (9, 15, 27)>, <12, (5, 6, 27)>, <15, (3, 11, 25)>, <17, (1, 9, 29)>, <24, (4, 5, 7)>, <25, (9, 15, 0)>, <26, (8, 19, 20)>, <27, (1, 10, 12)>, <29, (2, 17, 18)>

These are the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
