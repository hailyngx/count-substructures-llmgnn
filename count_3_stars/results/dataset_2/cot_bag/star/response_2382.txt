Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 58

So, there are 58 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets: [58].

Lastly, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 13)>, <0, (1, 5, 14)>, <0, (1, 12, 13)>, <0, (1, 12, 14)>, <0, (5, 12, 13)>, <0, (5, 12, 14)>,
<1, (0, 5, 13)>, <1, (0, 5, 14)>, <1, (5, 12, 13)>, <1, (5, 12, 14)>,
<2, (10, 11, 9)>, <2, (10, 12, 9)>, <2, (10, 12, 11)>,
<4, (6, 12, 13)>, <4, (6, 12, 14)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 13)>, <4, (0, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 5, 12)>,
<5, (0, 1, 13)>, <5, (0, 1, 14)>, <5, (1, 10, 14)>, <5, (1, 11, 14)>, <5, (10, 14, 13)>, <5, (11, 10, 14)>,
<12, (0, 5, 13)>, <12, (0, 5, 14)>

These 3-stars are found in the graph with the given nodes and edges.
