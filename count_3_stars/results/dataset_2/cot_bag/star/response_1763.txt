Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed by nodes with at least 3 neighbors = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph (inside brackets) = [50]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
