Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 15) (19, 1) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 19) (9, 13) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
This graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. We'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with each such node.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \)

So, there are 30 3-stars in the graph. 
Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 4, 17>
<0, 10, 17>
<0, 12, 18>
