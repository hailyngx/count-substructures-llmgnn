Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 5) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For central node 0:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For central node 1:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For central node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For central node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For central node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For central node 8:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For central node 10:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For central node 11:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For central node 12:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For central node 13:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For central node 14:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Adding these up:
\[ 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [78].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 10, 13)>, <0, (3, 8, 12)>, <0, (4, 10, 14)>, <0, (5, 6, 11)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 12)>, <1, (9, 10, 13)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 10, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 13)>, <8, (0, 1, 12)>, <8, (3, 9, 10)>, <8, (0, 1, 12)>, <10, (1, 8, 13)>, <11, (0, 6, 14)>.
