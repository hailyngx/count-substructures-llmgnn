Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 3, 2, 7, 4
- Node 1: 9, 2, 8
- Node 2: 5, 1, 8, 4, 7, 0
- Node 3: 9, 7, 0
- Node 4: 2, 0
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2
- Node 6: 5, 9, 8, 0
- Node 7: 9, 3, 2, 8, 0
- Node 8: 6, 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 3, 1, 7, 0

Following the described method to find 3-stars, we find:
- For node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 4: No 3-star
- For node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 71.

Therefore, all the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 1, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
