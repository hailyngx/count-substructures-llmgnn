Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can construct the following 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 10)> 
- Node 2: <2, (6, 12, 14)> 
- Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 13)> 
- Node 5: <5, (1, 8, 11)> 
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 11)> 
- Node 9: <9, (3, 7, 12)> 
- Node 10: <10, (1, 5, 6)> 
- Node 11: <11, (0, 7, 5)> 
- Node 12: <12, (2, 9, 13)> 
- Node 13: <13, (3, 4, 8)> 
- Node 14: <14, (0, 2, 3)> 

Now, we sum up the total number of these 3-stars: 
\[ [11] \]
