Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 8) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (6, 0) (6, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 2) (18, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 15: {7, 13, 4}
- Node 16: {2, 17}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 16}
- Node 18: {6, 19}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 18}

By examining the list, we can see possible 3-star formations:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 12)>
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 17, 19)>
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (9, 13, 14)> and <2, (9, 13, 16)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 17)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 15)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (4, 9, 14)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 15, 19)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 10 forms two 3-stars: <10, (0, 8, 12)> and <10, (9, 13, 15)>
- Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (2, 9, 15)>
- Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 15 forms one 3-star: <15, (4, 7, 13)>
- Node 17 forms one 3-star: <17, (1, 3, 16)>
- Node 19 forms one 3-star: <19, (1, 7, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 15, which can be represented as [15].
