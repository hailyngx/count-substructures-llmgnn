Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 (1 edge)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8 (3 edges)
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9 (4 edges)
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9 (3 edges)
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (6 edges)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 edges)
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8, 9 (4 edges)
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9 (3 edges)
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 9 (4 edges)
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 (6 edges)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 20 = 40], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
