Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we have the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (4, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 9), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 4), (1, 8)}

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 (this node has exactly 3 neighbors)
For the rest of the nodes, they don't have at least 3 neighbors.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 31. Putting this number inside brackets []:

[31]

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<6, (7, 2, 3)>
