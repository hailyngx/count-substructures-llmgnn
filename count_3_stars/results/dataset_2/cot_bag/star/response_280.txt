Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 17) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 20) (20, 28) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 4) (6, 28) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 24) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 0) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 16) (25, 11) (25, 8) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 10) (0, 29) (0, 26) (0, 11) (13, 14) (13, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 51 \).

So, there are [51] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars: <1, (7, 10, 11)>, <3, (27, 1, 16)>, <4, (27, 26, 20)>, <7, (1, 28, 5)>, <8, (21, 25, 14)>, <10, (1, 23, 17)>, <11, (1, 0, 25)>, <14, (20, 8, 17)>, <15, (27, 19, 2)>, <16, (24, 3, 1)>, <17, (27, 14, 23)>, <20, (4, 22, 13)>, <22, (14, 24, 20)>, <23, (11, 10, 17)>, <26, (18, 0, 4)>, <27, (3, 17, 15)>, <28, (7, 20, 6)>, <29, (0, 5, 2)>.
