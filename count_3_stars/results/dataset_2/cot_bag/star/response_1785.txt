Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 20) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 11) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 13) (28, 6) (28, 17) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 29) (21, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 16) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 24) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (20, 26) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 7) (23, 3) (23, 12) (25, 15) (25, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 23) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 24) (7, 27) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 2) (19, 14) (19, 20) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 9, 6, 17, 18, 24, 11.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 39 \).

Therefore, the answer is [39], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (9, 11, 28)>, <17, (10, 11, 28)>, <18, (4, 7, 13)>, <24, (0, 11, 29)>, <11, (4, 15, 24)>.
