Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 5, 9, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors 5, 9, 7, 3
- Node 3: neighbors 4, 7, 2, 0
- Node 4: neighbors 9, 7, 6, 3, 0
- Node 5: neighbors 9, 2, 1
- Node 6: neighbors 9, 4, 1, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 9, 4, 0, 3, 2
- Node 9: neighbors 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 2, 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (4, 0, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
