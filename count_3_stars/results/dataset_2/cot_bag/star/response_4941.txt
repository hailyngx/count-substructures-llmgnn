Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes first:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 13, 10, 11
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 17, 11, 14, 4
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 15, 9, 10
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 9, 6, 14
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 15, 19, 14
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 13, 17, 14, 6
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 17, 12, 16, 0
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 8, 7, 18, 12, 2
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 18, 8, 5
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: 13, 12, 2, 18, 11
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 15, 17, 14, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 18: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node gives us a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 34 3-stars.

So, the final answer is: [34]. The unique 3-stars identified in the graph are: <0, (3, 13, 11)>, <2, (17, 11, 14)>, <5, (15, 9, 10)>, <7, (9, 6, 14)>, <8, (15, 19, 14)>, <12, (13, 17, 14)>, <13, (17, 12, 16)>, <14, (8, 7, 18)>, <15, (18, 8, 5)>, <17, (13, 12, 2)>, <18, (15, 17, 14)>.
