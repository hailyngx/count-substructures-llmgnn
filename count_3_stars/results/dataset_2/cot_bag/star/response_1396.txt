Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 25) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 8) (15, 20) (15, 23) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 19) (7, 2) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (3, 21) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 16) (12, 4) (23, 10) (23, 15) (26, 16) (26, 6) (19, 10) (19, 28) (19, 16) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 29) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 29) (27, 5) (27, 29) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 8) (29, 27) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 7) (18, 3) (18, 24) (6, 26) (6, 25) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 13 has neighbors 22, 2, 20
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 0, 27
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 4, 11, 12
- Node 1 has neighbors 21, 17, 2, 10, 4
- Node 21 has neighbors 1, 3, 2
- Node 10 has neighbors 1, 17, 19, 23
- Node 17 has neighbors 1, 10, 8
- Node 20 has neighbors 13, 15, 12
- Node 0 has neighbors 5, 14, 24
- Node 14 has neighbors 0, 29, 25
- Node 11 has neighbors 9, 8, 4
- Node 16 has neighbors 28, 12, 4, 26, 19
- Node 4 has neighbors 9, 1, 11, 16, 12
- Node 12 has neighbors 9, 20, 16, 4
- Node 23 has neighbors 10, 15
- Node 19 has neighbors 10, 28, 16
- Node 24 has neighbors 0, 18, 29
- Node 8 has neighbors 17, 11, 29
- Node 27 has neighbors 5, 29
- Node 29 has neighbors 14, 24, 8, 27

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 13 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <13, (22, 2, 20)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <5, (9, 0, 27)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <9, (5, 4, 11)>, <9, (5, 4, 12)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <1, (21, 17, 2)>, <1, (21, 2, 10)>, <1, (21, 10, 4)>, <1, (17, 10, 4)>
- Node 21 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <21, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <10, (1, 17, 19)>
- Node 17 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <17, (1, 10, 8)>
- Node 20 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <20, (13, 15, 12)>
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <0, (5, 14, 24)>
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <14, (0, 29, 25)>
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <11, (9, 8, 4)>
- Node 16 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <16, (28, 12, 4)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <4, (9, 1, 11)>, <4, (9, 1, 16)>, <4, (9, 11, 12)>, <4, (9, 16, 12)>, <4, (1, 16, 12)>
- Node 12 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <12, (9, 20, 16)>
- Node 23 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <23, (10, 15, 0)>
- Node 19 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <19, (10, 28, 16)>
- Node 24 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <24, (0, 18, 29)>
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <8, (17, 11, 29)>
- Node 27 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <27, (5, 29, 24)>
- Node 29 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <29, (14, 24, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is then given by the sum of the count from each node which is 19. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [19].
