Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 2) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 16) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 5) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 16) (0, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (29, 9) (29, 4) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 24) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 13) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 24) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 12) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 26) (15, 18) (15, 19) (19, 15) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 25) (21, 9) (21, 0) (13, 25) (13, 1) (13, 23) (13, 27) (27, 18) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 24) (23, 20) (23, 1) (23, 13) (23, 27) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 20) (5, 11) (5, 27) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze the nodes to see which nodes have at least three neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 10, 22, 28, 29
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 16, 24
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 8, 17, 18, 22
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 18, 21, 26, 29
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3, 17, 24
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 1, 23, 25, 27
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 20, 25, 10
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 18, 19, 26
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 6, 24, 28
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 9, 15, 27
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 1, 13, 20, 27
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 6, 12, 16, 22
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 2, 13, 14
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 2, 15, 28, 9
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 5, 13, 18, 23
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 16, 26
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 4, 9, 19

Now, apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars up, we have 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+10+1+1+1+1 = 21.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 10, 28, 29>, <6, 3, 16, 24>, <7, 8, 17, 7>, <9, 18, 26, 29>, <12, 3, 17, 24>, <13, 1, 23, 27>, <14, 10, 20, 25>, <15, 18, 19, 26>, <16, 6, 24, 28>, <18, 7, 8, 27>, <23, 1, 13, 27>.
