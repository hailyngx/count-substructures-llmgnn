Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14. We will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Node 0:
    - Node 0 has 5 neighbors (9, 7, 10, 6, 12). There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 0.
    - Total 3-stars with node 0: 10

Node 1:
    - Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 4, 2, 6). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 1.
    - Total 3-stars with node 1: 4

Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 5 neighbors (10, 1, 6, 3, 4). There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 4.
    - Total 3-stars with node 4: 10

Node 5:
    - Node 5 has 4 neighbors (13, 3, 10, 14). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 5.
    - Total 3-stars with node 5: 4

Node 6:
    - Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 0, 1, 12). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 6.
    - Total 3-stars with node 6: 4

Node 9:
    - Node 9 has 4 neighbors (11, 7, 1, 0). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 9.
    - Total 3-stars with node 9: 4

Node 10:
    - Node 10 has 6 neighbors (5, 4, 8, 11, 0, 2). There are inom{6}{3} = 20 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 10.
    - Total 3-stars with node 10: 20

Node 13:
    - Node 13 has 5 neighbors (5, 2, 11, 3, 14). There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 13.
    - Total 3-stars with node 13: 10

Node 14:
    - Node 14 has 4 neighbors (5, 13, 11, 0). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star with node 14.
    - Total 3-stars with node 14: 4

Summing up all the 3-stars formed with the nodes, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 60.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 6, 10)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<4, (10, 1, 6)>
<5, (13, 3, 14)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<9, (11, 7, 0)>
<10, (5, 11, 2)>
<13, (5, 11, 14)>
