Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 22) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (22, 17) (22, 9) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 27) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 12) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 3) (8, 7) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 4) (25, 18) (25, 21) (27, 13) (27, 29) (27, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (28, 1) (28, 10) (28, 2) (2, 27) (2, 28) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 0) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 0) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 10) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (6, 14) (20, 14) (20, 8) (0, 23) (0, 12) (21, 25) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 16) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes based on their degree:

1. Node 1 has degree 4.
2. Node 4 has degree 4.
3. Node 5 has degree 4.
4. Node 8 has degree 4.
5. Node 9 has degree 4.
6. Node 11 has degree 5.
7. Node 13 has degree 4.
8. Node 14 has degree 4.
9. Node 15 has degree 3.
10. Node 16 has degree 3.
11. Node 17 has degree 4.
12. Node 18 has degree 4.
13. Node 19 has degree 4.
14. Node 20 has degree 3.
15. Node 26 has degree 4.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives us:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 15: No 3-star (\( \dim\! = 3 \), <15, 11, 29> is isolated)
10. Node 16: No 3-star (\( \dim\! = 3 \), <16, 1, 10> is isolated)
11. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
14. Node 20: No 3-star (\( \dim\! = 3 \), <20, 8, 14> is isolated)
15. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node gives us \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 46 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
