Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 21) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 7) (6, 2) (28, 26) (28, 22) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 28) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 11) (5, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 25) (29, 24) (0, 21) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 11) (10, 1) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 7) (24, 29) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 23) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 15) (2, 6) (2, 7) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 25) (11, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 43 \)

So, there are 43 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [43].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (3, 8, 22)>, <4, (3, 18, 19)>, <4, (8, 4, 23)>, <4, (8, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 8, 19)>, <8, (4, 22, 28)>, <8, (7, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (15, 8, 23)>, <13, (21, 13, 19)>, <14, (17, 14, 18)>, <18, (14, 18, 26)>, <18, (18, 3, 19)>, <18, (5, 18, 26)>, 
<19, (8, 19, 13)>, <21, (4, 21, 13)>, <22, (4, 22, 26)>, <23, (15, 23, 20)>, <25, (11, 25, 27)>, <26, (11, 26, 20)>, 
<27, (11, 25, 27)>, <29, (25, 29, 27)>.
