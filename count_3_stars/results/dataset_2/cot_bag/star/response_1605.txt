Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 3) (17, 16) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 18) (16, 17) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 11) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 18) (4, 1) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
Node 0: {1, 6, 10, 12}
Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 15}
Node 3: {14, 15, 17, 18}
Node 6: {0, 2, 9, 13, 19}
Node 7: {1, 5, 9, 18}
Node 9: {6, 7, 10}
Node 10: {0, 8, 9, 12}
Node 12: {0, 10, 14, 19}
Node 13: {6, 15, 19}
Node 14: {3, 12, 19}
Node 15: {1, 3, 11, 13}
Node 19: {6, 12, 13, 14}

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

So, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 10)>
<0, (1, 6, 12)>
<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<1, (0, 7, 15)>
<3, (14, 15, 18)>
<6, (0, 13, 19)>
<10, (0, 12, 19)>
<12, (0, 10, 14)>
<14, (3, 12, 19)>
<15, (1, 11, 13)>
<19, (6, 12, 14)>
