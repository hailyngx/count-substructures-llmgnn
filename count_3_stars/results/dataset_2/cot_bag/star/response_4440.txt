Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 5) (1, 5) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 14) (2, 10) (12, 3) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18. So we will check each of these nodes to see how many 3-stars are formed with each of them.

Checking node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 11, 8, 16
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0
- So, <0, (11, 8, 16)>

Checking node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 1

Checking node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 10, 14, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 2

Checking node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 12, (no more neighbors)
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3
- So, <3, (4, 5, 12)>, <3, (4, 5, 15)>, <3, (4, 15, 14)>, <3, (5, 12, 15)>

Checking node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 13, 17, 19, 7
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 6
- So, <6, (13, 17, 19)>, <6, (13, 17, 7)>, <6, (13, 19, 7)>, <6, (17, 19, 7)>

Checking node 7:
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 6, 13, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 7

Checking node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 11, 19
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 8
- So, <8, (0, 11, 19)>

Checking node 12:
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor: 3, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 12

Checking node 14:
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 14

Checking node 15:
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 19, 4, (no more neighbors)
- There are no 3-star formed with node 15

Checking node 18:
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 17, 19, 10
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 18
- So, <18, (17, 19, 10)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10
Thus, there are 10 3-stars in total for this graph: [10]
