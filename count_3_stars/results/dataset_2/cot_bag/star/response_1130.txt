Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 and node 5. 

For node 3, there are 5 possible 3-stars that can be formed:
- <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 7, 1)>
- <3, (4, 6, 0)>
- <3, (0, 6, 2)>

For node 5, there are 5 possible 3-stars that can be formed:
- <5, (9, 8, 2)>
- <5, (9, 3, 4)>
- <5, (8, 9, 2)>
- <5, (8, 4, 0)>
- <5, (2, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
