Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 7, 4, 6
- Node 1: 5, 9, 6, 4
- Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 7, 0
- Node 3: 9, 2, 4
- Node 4: 9, 0, 1, 6, 3
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 2, 8, 0, 7, 1, 4
- Node 7: 5, 2, 0, 6
- Node 8: 9, 6
- Node 9: 8, 4, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <2, (9, 6, 0)>
- <4, (9, 0, 6)>
- <6, (2, 8, 7)>
- <9, (8, 4, 2)>
- <9, (4, 1, 3)>
