Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- For Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- For Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- For Node 0: No 3-stars
- For Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- For Node 4: No 3-stars

Counting the 3-stars gives a total of [3].
