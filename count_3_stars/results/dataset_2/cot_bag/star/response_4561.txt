Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: node 2, node 3, and node 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2 (which has 6 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- For node 3 (which has 5 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- For node 4 (which has 6 neighbors), the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \), and we can list them as follows:
\[ [ (2, 10, 13), (2, 13, 14), (2, 3, 13), (2, 4, 13), \\
(3, 1, 10), (3, 8, 13), (3, 13, 14), (3, 2, 14), (3, 2, 10), \\
(4, 8, 13), (4, 13, 14), (4, 0, 8), (4, 0, 12), (4, 0, 14), (4, 10, 13), \\
(10, 1, 3), (10, 1, 8), (10, 1, 12), (10, 2, 13), (10, 11, 12), \\
(11, 6, 14), (11, 8, 13), (11, 12, 0), (11, 12, 1), \\
(12, 0, 14), (12, 1, 11), (12, 11, 0), (12, 11, 1), (12, 11, 10) ]
\]

So, the final answer is: \[ [50] \].
