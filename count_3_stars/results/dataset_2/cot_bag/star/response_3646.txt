Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 6) (19, 10) (4, 2) (4, 1) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (10, 19) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 5, 12, and 16.
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 15, 16, and 18.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 5, 8, and 19.
- Node 13 has neighbors 5, 7, 11, and 14.
- Node 15 has neighbors 2, 11, 12, and 18.
- Node 16 has neighbors 1, 2, 17, and 16.
- Node 17 has neighbors 3, 14, 16, and 18.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 1, 2, 6, 13, 15, 16, and 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \).

Inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 12)>
- <1, (4, 5, 16)>
- <1, (4, 12, 16)>
- <1, (5, 12, 16)>
- <2, (4, 15, 16)>
- <2, (4, 15, 18)>
- <2, (4, 16, 18)>
- <2, (15, 16, 18)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 19)>
- <6, (0, 8, 19)>
- <6, (5, 8, 19)>
- <13, (5, 7, 11)>
- <13, (5, 7, 14)>
- <13, (5, 11, 14)>
- <13, (7, 11, 14)>
- <15, (2, 11, 12)>
- <15, (2, 11, 18)>
- <15, (2, 12, 18)>
- <15, (11, 12, 18)>
- <16, (1, 2, 17)>
- <16, (1, 2, 16)>
- <16, (1, 16, 17)>
- <16, (2, 16, 17)>
- <17, (3, 14, 18)>
- <17, (3, 14, 16)>
- <17, (3, 16, 18)>
- <17, (14, 16, 18)>
