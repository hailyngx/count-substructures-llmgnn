Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center. Since each 3-star consists of the center node and exactly three other nodes, we will use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to determine the number of possible 3-star combinations.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 20 + 35 + 20 + 35 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 142\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 142 [142].
