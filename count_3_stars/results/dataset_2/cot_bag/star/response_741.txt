Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 3) (14, 3) (12, 0) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 15 nodes and the given 60 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
{0, 1}, {0, 6}, {0, 8}, {0, 10}, {0, 12},
{1, 4}, {1, 6}, {1, 7}, {1, 8}, {1, 11},
{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 9}, {2, 10}, {2, 13},
{3, 6}, {3, 10}, {3, 11}, {3, 14},
{4, 1}, {4, 2}, {4, 7}, {4, 10},
{5, 6}, {5, 11}, {5, 13},
{6, 0}, {6, 1}, {6, 3},
{7, 1}, {7, 4}, {7, 8}, {7, 11}, {7, 13},
{8, 0}, {8, 1}, {8, 7}, {8, 12},
{9, 2}, {9, 10}, {9, 13},
{10, 0}, {10, 2}, {10, 3}, {10, 4},
{11, 3}, {11, 5}, {11, 7},
{12, 0}, {12, 8},
{13, 2}, {13, 5}, {13, 7}, {13, 9},
{14, 3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming only 1 3-star.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming only 1 3-star.

Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Node 11 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 11>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 10, 2>, <0, 10, 3>, <0, 10, 4>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <... (total of 72 3-stars)
