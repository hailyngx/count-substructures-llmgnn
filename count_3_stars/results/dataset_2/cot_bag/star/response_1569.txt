Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degrees of the nodes are:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 2

Since the graph has 10 nodes and each edge connects two nodes, it is clear that there are \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) edges in the graph.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
