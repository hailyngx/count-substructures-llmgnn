Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 7, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 7, 0, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 10 3-stars.

By summing up all these, we get a total of [30] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- <1, (6, 9, 7)>
- <4, (6, 9, 2)>
- <6, (9, 1, 2)>
- <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- <9, (6, 8, 4)>
