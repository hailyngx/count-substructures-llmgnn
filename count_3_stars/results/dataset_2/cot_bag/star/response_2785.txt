Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
Since we have 20 nodes, we can create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 7, 13
Node 1: 3, 7, 13
Node 2: 9, 15
Node 3: 1, 12, 13
Node 4: 5, 12
Node 5: 4, 6, 10, 14, 18
Node 6: 0, 5, 17
Node 7: 0, 1, 9, 10
Node 8: 10, 11
Node 9: 2, 7, 19
Node 10: 5, 7, 8, 15, 19
Node 11: 8, 12, 13, 16
Node 12: 3, 4, 11
Node 13: 0, 1, 3, 11
Node 14: 5, 17
Node 15: 2, 10, 16
Node 16: 11, 15, 17, 19
Node 17: 6, 14, 16
Node 18: 5
Node 19: 9, 10, 16

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:

For node 5, we have 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, we have 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 10, we have 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 11, we have 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 13, we have 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 16, we have 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 17, we have 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.
For node 19, we have 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars, we get \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [34] \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 34, and the unique 3-stars are <5, (4, 6, 10)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <10, (5, 7, 15)>, <11, (8, 12, 13)>, <16, (15, 17, 19)>, <17, (6, 14, 16)>, <19, (9, 10, 16)>.
