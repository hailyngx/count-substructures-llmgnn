Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 16, 17, 8, 13, 15, 2, 12, 3, 19, 6, 14, 4, 9, 10, 18.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <16, (11, 17, 2)> <16, (11, 17, 9)> <16, (11, 17, 4)> <16, (17, 2, 9)>

- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <17, (16, 1, 2)> <17, (16, 1, 15)> <17, (16, 2, 15)> <17, (16, 3, 15)> <17, (1, 2, 15)> <17, (1, 15, 18)> <17, (2, 15, 18)> <17, (2, 3, 15)> <17, (1, 2, 18)> <17, (1, 15, 18)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (14, 10, 6)> <8, (14, 6, 12)> <8, (10, 6, 12)> <8, (14, 10, 12)>

- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <13, (12, 4, 15)> <13, (12, 15, 0)> <13, (4, 15, 0)> <13, (12, 4, 0)>

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <15, (13, 17, 19)> <15, (13, 18, 19)> <15, (17, 18, 19)> <15, (13, 17, 18)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (16, 12, 4)> <2, (16, 4, 17)> <2, (16, 4, 12)> <2, (12, 4, 17)>

- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <12, (8, 13, 2)> <12, (8, 2, 6)> <12, (13, 2, 4)> <12, (8, 13, 6)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <3, (17, 0, 5)>

- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <6, (8, 10, 14)> <6, (8, 10, 5)> <6, (10, 14, 9)> <6, (8, 14, 9)>

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <14, (8, 6, 9)> <14, (8, 10, 6)> <14, (6, 10, 5)> <14, (8, 10, 9)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <4, (13, 2, 11)>

- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <10, (8, 6, 5)>

- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <18, (1, 15, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 36 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 36 3-stars in this graph.
