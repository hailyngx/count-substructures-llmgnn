Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 41

So, there are a total of 41 unique 3-stars in this graph.
Inside brackets []: [41]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (15, 17, 13)>, <2, (18, 8, 14)>, <5, (18, 6, 19)>, <6, (2, 7, 10)>, <9, (11, 15, 8)>, <10, (3, 6, 8)>, <14, (15, 2, 0)>, <15, (1, 14, 17)>, <16, (11, 0, 12)>
