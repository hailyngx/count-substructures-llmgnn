Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 23) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 16) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (14, 26) (14, 15) (14, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 5) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 21) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 25) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 1) (20, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 23) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 24) (19, 1) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (13, 9) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 24) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 29) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 9, 27, 4, 11, 7
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 21, 10, 22, 24
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 10, 7, 12
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 18, 2
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 13, 23
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 23, 0, 14, 23
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 28, 25, 12
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 0, 16, 7, 29
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 1, 20, 5, 22
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 21, 25, 4, 5
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 9, 15, 14, 24
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 3, 28, 5, 23
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 17, 22, 11
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 1, 28, 14
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 26, 3, 17, 24

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 2: 
  - inom{5}{3} = 10

- For Node 5: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 7: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 9: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 15: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 17: 
  - inom{3}{3} = 1

- For Node 18: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 21: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 22: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 23: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 24: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

- For Node 25: 
  - inom{3}{3} = 1

- For Node 26: 
  - inom{3}{3} = 1

- For Node 28: 
  - inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up all the 3-stars obtained for each node, we get: 
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].
