Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 10) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (6, 13) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 17) (1, 18) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are 52 3-stars in this graph.

Each 3-star can be represented as follows:
<0, (4, 13, 18)>, <4, (0, 7, 19)>, <8, (2, 11, 16)>, <9, (13, 16, 19)>, <10, (2, 11, 16)>, <13, (0, 9, 14)>, <14, (7, 12, 17)>, <15, (3, 18, 19)>, <16, (2, 9, 10)>, <17, (0, 5, 18)>, <18, (1, 11, 15)>, <19, (4, 8, 15)>.

Thus, putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets yields [52].
