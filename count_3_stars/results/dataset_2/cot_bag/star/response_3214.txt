Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 28) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 25) (4, 27) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 21) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 22) (21, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 20) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 9) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 24) (16, 10) (16, 21) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 20) (2, 7) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 5) (14, 6) (14, 23) (3, 19) (19, 12) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 24) (13, 29) (13, 25) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 5) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) 

Response:
This graph contains 3-star configurations with the following nodes as centers and leaves:

\[
<1, 26, 22, 5>, <4, 27, 12, 5>, <7, 2, 8, 0>, <10, 1, 26, 22>, <11, 23, 9, 24>, <15, 28, 6, 21>, <17, 29, 13, 25>, <18, 26, 5, 20>
\]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:
  
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, so we have:

\[ [ 8 \times \binom{3}{3} ] = [8 \times 1] = 8 \] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8.
