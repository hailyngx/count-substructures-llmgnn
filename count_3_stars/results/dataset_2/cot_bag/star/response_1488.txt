Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 5) (21, 10) (21, 12) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 20) (22, 26) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 22) (3, 13) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 25) (26, 22) (26, 16) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 28) (2, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 12) (0, 29) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (23, 27) (23, 28) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 0) (29, 13) (14, 2) (14, 24) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 27) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 28) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 25) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 23) (28, 20) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 5, 6 (degree: 3)
- Node 5 has neighbors 4, 7, 17 (degree: 3)
- Node 8 has neighbors 6, 9, 25 (degree: 3)
- Node 9 has neighbors 8, 13, 15, 19 (degree: 4)
- Node 10 has neighbors 17, 21, 27 (degree: 3)
- Node 11 has neighbors 17, 18, 27 (degree: 3)
- Node 12 has neighbors 1, 19, 21, 25 (degree: 4)
- Node 13 has neighbors 3, 9, 29 (degree: 3)
- Node 16 has neighbors 6, 20, 24, 26 (degree: 4)
- Node 17 has neighbors 5, 10, 11 (degree: 3)
- Node 18 has neighbors 11, 19, 20 (degree: 3)
- Node 19 has neighbors 9, 12, 18, 29 (degree: 4)
- Node 20 has neighbors 16, 18, 22, 28 (degree: 4)
- Node 21 has neighbors 10, 12 (degree: 2)
- Node 22 has neighbors 3, 20, 26 (degree: 3)
- Node 24 has neighbors 14, 16, 28 (degree: 3)
- Node 25 has neighbors 1, 8, 12, 7, 28 (degree: 5)
- Node 27 has neighbors 10, 11, 23 (degree: 3)
- Node 28 has neighbors 25, 20, 23, 24 (degree: 4)
- Node 29 has neighbors 8, 13, 19, 0 (degree: 4)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 33 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 17)>
<8, (6, 9, 25)>
<9, (13, 15, 19)>
<12, (1, 19, 25)>
<16, (6, 20, 24)>
<19, (9, 12, 29)>
<20, (16, 18, 28)>
<25, (1, 8, 12)>
<28, (20, 24, 25)>
<29, (8, 13, 19)>
