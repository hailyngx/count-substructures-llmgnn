Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 0) (22, 12) (11, 19) (11, 29) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 8) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 29) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 8) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 17) (27, 9) (27, 26) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 23) (3, 14) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (4, 26) (4, 2) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 24) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 28) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 15) (29, 11) (29, 7) (29, 23) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) (23, 14) (23, 29) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are numbered from 0 to 29. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 26, 2, 28, 10, 27. So, there are $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 13, 9, 12, 1. So, there are $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 10 as the central node.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 19, 29. Hence, there are no 3-stars with node 11 as the central node.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 21, 24, 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 16 as the central node.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 20, 12, 6, 8. So, there are $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 17 as the central node.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 11, 18, 15, 24, 1. So, there are $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars with node 19 as the central node.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 25, 17, 1, 6. So, there are $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 20 as the central node.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 16, 7, 28. So, there is 1 3-star with node 21 as the central node.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 16, 18, 19, 15. So, there are $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 24 as the central node.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 9, 15, 27, 4. So, there are $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 26 as the central node.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors: 9, 21, 6, 1, 5. So, there are $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars with node 28 as the central node.

Putting these numbers together, there are a total of $10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 56 $ 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[56]$. The unique 3-stars identified are:
