Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 20) (26, 10) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 25) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 21) (8, 24) (23, 12) (23, 13) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 16) (19, 28) (19, 27) (13, 23) (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 12) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 22) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 1) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 12) (5, 3) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 11) (28, 19) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 10) (10, 26) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 4) (25, 6) (25, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 6: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 10: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- For node 12: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 14: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 15: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 16: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 17: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 18: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 20: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 21: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 22: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 23: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 24: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$
- For node 25: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$
- For node 26: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 27: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 29: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

Adding these up: $1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 72$

Therefore, there are 72 3-stars in this graph.
