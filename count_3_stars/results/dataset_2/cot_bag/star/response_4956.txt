Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 17) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 19) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 8, 13, 2, 18, 1, 9, 16, 12, 3, 19, 11, and 0.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 11, 19)>
<8, (2, 18, 9)>
<13, (2, 10, 12)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<18, (5, 8, 11)>
<1, (9, 16, 17)>
<9, (1, 8, 17)>
<16, (1, 12, 0)>
<12, (2, 13, 16)>
<3, (2, 10, 19)>
<19, (3, 14, 7)>
<11, (0, 5, 7)>
