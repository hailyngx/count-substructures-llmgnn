Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 1) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 14, 10) - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: 4 neighbors (9, 13, 12, 2) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: 5 neighbors (7, 12, 14, 6, 2) - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 5 neighbors (8, 10, 14, 11, 6) - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: 4 neighbors (9, 13, 8, 0) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: 4 neighbors (4, 12, 0, 3) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: 3 neighbors (13, 12, 3) - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 8: 3 neighbors (5, 9, 4) - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 8, 14, 1) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 10: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 2) - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 11: 4 neighbors (8, 4, 12, 11) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 12: 5 neighbors (7, 6, 11, 1, 3) - \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 13: 3 neighbors (5, 1, 7) - \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 14: 4 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 3) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 49 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 14, 10)>  
<1, (9, 13, 12)>  
<3, (7, 12, 14)>  
<4, (8, 10, 14)>  
<5, (9, 13, 8)>  
<6, (4, 12, 0)>  
<7, (13, 12, 3)>  
<8, (5, 9, 4)>  
<9, (5, 8, 14)>  
<10, (0, 4, 2)>  
<11, (8, 4, 12)>  
<12, (7, 6, 11)>  
<13, (5, 1, 7)>  
<14, (9, 4, 0)>
