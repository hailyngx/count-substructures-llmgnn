Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 8, 9, 3
- Node 1: 9, 6, 4, 8, 5
- Node 2: 9, 4, 8, 3
- Node 3: 0, 6, 4, 2
- Node 4: 6, 3, 2, 1
- Node 5: 9, 1, 7
- Node 6: 9, 1, 4, 3
- Node 7: 5, 9, 0
- Node 8: 2, 0, 1
- Node 9: 5, 1, 0, 6, 7, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = [20]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
[1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = [41]

Therefore, there are 41 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed:
<0, (8, 9, 3)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 3)>, <1, (8, 0, 1)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <9, (1, 0, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 2)>, <9, (4, 6, 3)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>, <9, (4, 8, 5)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 9, 5)>, <9, (8, 0, 2)>, <9, (8, 0, 4)>, <9, (8, 0, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 2)>, <9, (0, 8, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>, <9, (7, 5, 9)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>
