Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9, 12
- Node 1: 3, 6, 10, 11, 12
- Node 2: 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 0
- Node 3: 1, 7, 14
- Node 4: 2, 8, 12, 14
- Node 5: 10, 11
- Node 6: 0, 1, 11, 12, 13
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8, 12, 13
- Node 10: 1, 2, 5, 14
- Node 11: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 12: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 13
- Node 13: 2, 6, 9, 12, 14
- Node 14: 3, 10, 4, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 2.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 4.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 6.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 10.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 11.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 12.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 13.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 82 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [82].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 10, 12)>, <2, (11, 12, 13)>, <4, (8, 12, 14)>, <6, (1, 11, 12)>, <10, (1, 2, 14)>, <12, (0, 1, 9)>, <13, (2, 6, 14)>
