Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes (nodes with at least 3 neighbors) in this graph are:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 7, 11, 5
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 2, 11, 6, 13, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 8, 11, 13, 10
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 14, 8, 3, 13, 12, 10
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 11, 13, 9, 1
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 11, 12, 9, 10, 1
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 14, 4, 10, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 7, 11>
- <3, 2, 13>
- <3, 6, 13>
- <3, 9, 13>
- <3, 11, 13>
- <5, 0, 8>
- <5, 0, 11>
- <5, 8, 13>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <6, 14, 8>
- <6, 3, 13>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <6, 12, 10>
- <7, 0, 11>
- <7, 1, 4>
- <7, 9, 3>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <4, 9, 10>
- <4, 1, 7>
- <12, 14, 6>
