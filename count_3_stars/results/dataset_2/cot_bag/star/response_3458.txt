Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are two nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 2 and node 3. 

Node 2 has 5 neighbors and node 3 has 5 neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
Node 2 forms 10 unique 3-stars.

For node 3:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
Node 3 forms 10 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10 + 10 = 20\), which we put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (9, 7, 1)>, 
<2, (9, 7, 3)>, 
<2, (9, 1, 3)>, 
<2, (7, 1, 3)>, 
<2, (7, 1, 8)>, 
<2, (7, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 1, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 2, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 8)>.
