Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 7) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 14) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.
Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 1 3-star.

Adding up these counts gives us a total of 33 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 18, 15)>
<3, (9, 6, 12)>
<4, (13, 17, 16)>
<5, (8, 16, 5)>
<6, (9, 8, 17)>
<8, (9, 18, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<10, (14, 19, 4)>
<12, (3, 6, 13)>
<13, (17, 12, 4)>
<14, (10, 19, 8)>
<15, (3, 18, 0)>
<16, (9, 5, 13)>
<17, (7, 1, 13)>
<18, (8, 15, 0)>
<19, (10, 17, 14)>
