- Node 20 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 12, and 21.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 20, and 24.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 11, 22, and 23.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 22.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 14, 19, 21, 24, and 28.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 10 and 28.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 27.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 24, 26, and 28.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 13 and 25.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (12, 14, 21)>, <1, (2, 15, 28)>, <4, (10, 18, 27)>, <6, (10, 14, 25)>, <10, (6, 14, 26)>, <11, (5, 7, 13)>, <12, (0, 18, 20)>, <14, (0, 16, 24)>, <18, (4, 6, 18)>, <19, (8, 15, 24)>, <20, (5, 12, 21)>, <21, (0, 2, 24)>, <24, (14, 19, 28)>, <25, (3, 9, 29)>
