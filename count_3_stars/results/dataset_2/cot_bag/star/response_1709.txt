Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 4) (26, 17) (15, 2) (15, 11) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 27) (17, 12) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 8) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 19) (20, 2) (20, 28) (21, 26) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 16) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 1) (16, 21) (16, 0) (1, 27) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 11) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 7) (19, 23) (19, 4) (4, 26) (4, 0) (4, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 24) (24, 7) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 29) (12, 11) (18, 10) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 5) (13, 9) (13, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 5, 6, 27 
- Node 3: neighbors 21, 25, 27, 10, 29
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 19, 26
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 8, 12, 14
- Node 9: neighbors 13, 22, 26
- Node 11: neighbors 5, 8, 12, 15
- Node 12: neighbors 6, 11, 17, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up these values gives the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
