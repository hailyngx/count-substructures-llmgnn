Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 23) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 22) (17, 7) (1, 6) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 12) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 6) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 16) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 13) (9, 29) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 0) (26, 25) (26, 5) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 6) (18, 23) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 18) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 2) (19, 29) (19, 9) (22, 17) (22, 11) (12, 25) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node.

Adding all these up, we get a total of 70 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [70]. 

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, 5, 8>
<5, 3, 11>
<6, 25, 24>
<8, 3, 28>
<9, 0, 24>
<11, 28, 2>
<14, 15, 7>
<15, 14, 23>
<20, 29, 9>
<21, 4, 10>
<23, 27, 14>
<24, 9, 19>
<25, 20, 11>
<28, 8, 2>
<29, 21, 10>
