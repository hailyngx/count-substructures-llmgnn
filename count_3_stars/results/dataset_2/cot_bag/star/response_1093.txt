Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 20) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 5) (25, 20) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 6) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 12) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 11) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 23) (24, 29) (24, 11) (6, 8) (6, 21) (3, 16) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 2) (23, 26) (23, 28) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 24) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 20) (5, 10) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 15, 27, 4, 7, 13, 18, 2, 29, 20, 8, 22, 1, 26, 21, 28, 24, and 6.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<15, 19, 13, 27>, <4, 7, 20, 25>, <4, 18, 12, 13>, <4, 21, 6, 8>, <7, 20, 25, 5>, <13, 27, 15, 19>, <13, 27, 14, 21>, <13, 18, 12, 19>, <18, 13, 17, 2>, <18, 13, 14, 21>, <2, 17, 4, 7>, <2, 17, 4, 18>, <1, 26, 23, 28>, <1, 26, 11, 24>, <1, 9, 10, 5>, <26, 23, 28, 21>, <21, 14, 16, 1>, <21, 14, 16, 3>, <21, 14, 12, 18>, <21, 14, 13, 27>, <14, 20, 25, 5>
