Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 1, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<6, (5, 0, 1)>
<9, (2, 6, 1)>
