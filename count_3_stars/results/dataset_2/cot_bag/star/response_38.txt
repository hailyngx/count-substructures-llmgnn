Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 6, 2
- Node 1: 9, 3, 6, 2, 8
- Node 2: 9, 7, 1, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 3
- Node 5: 9, 4, 0
- Node 6: 7, 1, 3, 0
- Node 7: 9, 0, 6, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 0
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3, 1, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- <0, (7, 6, 8)>
- <0, (7, 6, 2)>
- <0, (7, 8, 2)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 2)>
- <1, (3, 8, 2)>
- <3, (4, 1, 6)>
- <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 1, 7)>
- <9, (5, 1, 2)>
- <9, (5, 7, 2)>
- <9, (3, 1, 7)>
- <9, (3, 1, 2)>
- <9, (3, 7, 2)>
