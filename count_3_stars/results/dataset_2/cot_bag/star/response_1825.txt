Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 4 or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

In total, there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
