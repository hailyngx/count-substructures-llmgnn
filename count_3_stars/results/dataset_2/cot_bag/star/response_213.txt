Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars within brackets []:
For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of. 

For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (there are six neighbors for node 1)
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 68.

Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68].
