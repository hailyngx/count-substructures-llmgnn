Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54 \)

Therefore, we have a total of 54 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this number inside brackets gives us: [54]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>.
