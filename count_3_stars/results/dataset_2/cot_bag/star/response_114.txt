Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 17) (13, 5) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with the highest degree in this graph are 10, 12, 19, and 4, each with a degree of 4. We will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed from these nodes.

For node 10:
- Nodes connected to node 10: 6, 11, and 2
- Total 3-stars with node 10 as the center: 1

For node 12:
- Nodes connected to node 12: 10, 17, 19, and 14
- Total 3-stars with node 12 as the center: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

For node 19:
- Nodes connected to node 19: 11, 8, 7, and 12
- Total 3-stars with node 19 as the center: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

For node 4:
- Nodes connected to node 4: 1, 16, 14
- Total 3-stars with node 4 as the center: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <10, (6, 11, 2)>, <12, (10, 17, 19)>, <12, (10, 14, 17)>, <12, (10, 19, 14)>, <12, (17, 19, 14)>, <19, (11, 8, 7)>, <19, (11, 7, 12)>, <19, (11, 8, 12)>, <19, (8, 7, 12)>, <4, (1, 16, 14)>.
