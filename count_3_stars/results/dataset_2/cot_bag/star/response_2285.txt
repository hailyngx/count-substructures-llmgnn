Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
This graph has 15 nodes with degrees: 
- Node 0: 3 
- Node 1: 3 
- Node 2: 5 
- Node 3: 5 
- Node 4: 3 
- Node 5: 4 
- Node 6: 4 
- Node 7: 5 
- Node 8: 4 
- Node 9: 4 
- Node 10: 4 
- Node 11: 5 
- Node 12: 3 
- Node 13: 3 
- Node 14: 4 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<2, (5, 11, 13)>
<3, (7, 8, 11)>
<5, (2, 9, 11)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 13, 14)>
<10, (1, 6, 11)>
<11, (1, 7, 8)>
