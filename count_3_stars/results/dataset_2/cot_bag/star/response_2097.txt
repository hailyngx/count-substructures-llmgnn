Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 6, and 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 1, and 3
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 2, and 8
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 6, and 1
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 2, 8, and 3
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 4, and 0
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 7, and 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9, there is exactly 1 3-star each.
- For nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8, we'll apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the total number of 3-stars formed. 
  - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (9, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 1, 3)>
- <4, (9, 6, 1)>
- <9, (6, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 1)>
- <3, (5, 2, 8)>
- <3, (6, 4, 0)>
- <3, (6, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (6, 2, 8)>
- <5, (6, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 1, 3)>
- <6, (5, 9, 0)>
- <6, (5, 3, 4)>
- <6, (9, 4, 0)>
- <6, (9, 6, 0)>
- <6, (4, 1, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 7)>
- <8, (5, 3, 4)>
- <8, (5, 8, 7)>
- <8, (3, 1, 2)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
