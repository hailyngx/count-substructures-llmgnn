Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 10) (26, 13) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (17, 7) (1, 14) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 10) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 23) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (20, 21) (20, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (5, 27) (5, 29) (5, 3) (25, 17) (25, 14) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 21) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 25) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 23) (7, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 24) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 22) (10, 6) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 5
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 4
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 3
- Node 20: 3
- Node 21: 5
- Node 22: 4
- Node 23: 3
- Node 24: 3
- Node 25: 3
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 5
- Node 28: 3
- Node 29: 3

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 10, 21, and 27 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they form 1 3-star each.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):
   - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
The unique 3-stars found are:
