Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the given edges are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

There are a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56 \) 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 9, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>
