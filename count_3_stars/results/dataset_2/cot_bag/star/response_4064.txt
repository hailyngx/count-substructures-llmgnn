Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (3, 17) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 6) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 15) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <0, (1, 7, 13)>, <0, (11, 4, 7)>, <0, (11, 4, 13)>, <0, (1, 13, 7)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <2, (1, 11, 12)>, <2, (1, 11, 2)>, <2, (1, 2, 12)>, <2, (11, 12, 2)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <4, (11, 14, 17)>, <4, (11, 14, 19)>, <4, (14, 17, 19)>,  <4, (11, 17, 19)>

- Node 5: 1 3-star 
   <5, (7, 9, 19)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <6, (3, 8, 10)>, <6, (8, 10, 15)>, <6, (10, 15, 16)>, <6, (3, 10, 15)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <7, (0, 13, 14)>, <7, (0, 13, 7)>, <7, (0, 13, 4)>, <7, (0, 13, 13)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (2, 13, 14)>, <9, (2, 13, 0)>, <9, (2, 13, 7)>, <9, (2, 13, 9)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <10, (8, 16, 18)>, <10, (8, 16, 15)>, <10, (8, 16, 6)>, <10, (8, 16, 10)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <13, (0, 7, 13)>, <13, (0, 11, 2)>, <13, (9, 2, 14)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <14, (4, 9, 16)>, <14, (4, 9, 7)>, <14, (7, 9, 16)>, <14, (4, 7, 16)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <16, (10, 14, 15)>, <16, (10, 14, 6)>, <16, (6, 15, 18)>, <16, (10, 15, 18)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (as it has only two neighbors)
- Node 19: 1 3-star 
   <19, (4, 5, 18)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 33 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].
