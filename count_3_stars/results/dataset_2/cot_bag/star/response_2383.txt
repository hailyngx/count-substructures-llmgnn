Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 10, 11, 8, 13, 6, 7, 12, 2, 0, 14, 1, 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \text{inom}{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars by summing up the above results:
\(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 72 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 72.

Therefore, the final answer is [72]. 

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, 6, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 4, 13>, <9, 8, 2, 13>, <10, 0, 4, 12>, <10, 12, 14, 4>, <11, 1, 9, 7>, <13, 8, 12, 9>, <6, 3, 14, 4>.
