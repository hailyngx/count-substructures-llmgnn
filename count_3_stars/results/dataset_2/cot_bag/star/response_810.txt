Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {3, 14, 0, 8}
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {5, 8, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 7, 14, 10}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {6, 0, 10, 11}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 2, 12, 11}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 14, 12, 4}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 11, 7, 13}
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 2, 11}
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {9, 2, 10, 14, 0}
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors: {6, 1, 3, 13, 2, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 0, 8)>
- <2, (5, 13, 14)>
- <3, (1, 7, 14)>
- <4, (6, 0, 10)>
- <5, (9, 2, 12)>
- <6, (9, 12, 14)>
- <9, (5, 6, 13)>
- <12, (5, 6, 11)>
- <13, (9, 10, 14)>
- <14, (1, 3, 2)>
