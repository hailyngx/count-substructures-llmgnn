Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 19) (15, 5) (15, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 14) (27, 11) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (22, 5) (22, 0) (23, 29) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 3) (20, 16) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 12) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 5) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 21) (7, 13) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 16) (21, 27) (21, 26) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 28) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 4) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 24) (5, 26) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 29) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 15) (18, 8) (18, 24) (18, 14) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (4, 29) (4, 28) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: (12, 16)
2: (11, 25, 29)
3: (10, 20, 24, 28)
4: (28, 29)
5: (15, 22, 24, 26)
6: (11, 17)
7: (13, 25)
8: (13, 18)
9: (0, 17)
10: (3, 16, 25)
11: (2, 6, 27, 29)
12: (1, 17, 20)
13: (7, 8, 28)
14: (11, 18, 27)
15: (5, 17, 19)
16: (1, 10, 20)
17: (6, 9, 12, 15, 29)
18: (8, 14, 24)
19: (15)
20: (0, 12, 16)
21: (26, 27)
22: (5, 0)
23: (29)
24: (3, 5, 18, 26, 27)
25: (2, 7, 10)
26: (5, 21, 24)
27: (11, 14, 21, 24)
28: (3, 4, 13)
29: (2, 4, 11, 17, 23)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
