Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 27) (26, 16) (15, 27) (15, 4) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 19) (2, 22) (2, 1) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 14) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 25) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 14) (17, 29) (17, 10) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (24, 5) (24, 25) (24, 19) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 3) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 1) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 21) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 4, 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 22, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <4, (8, 5, 12)>, <4, (15, 6, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 24)>, <4, (8, 12, 6)>, <4, (15, 6, 20)>, <4, (6, 20, 14)>, <4, (5, 24, 19)>, <4, (12, 8, 28)>, <4, (8, 28, 1)>, <4, (28, 7, 16)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <8, (29, 4, 12)>, <8, (4, 12, 18)>, <8, (12, 18, 3)>, <8, (4, 28, 7)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (11, 17, 13)>, <10, (14, 11, 13)>, <10, (17, 12, 13)>, <10, (11, 25, 24)>

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <11, (14, 29, 13)>, <11, (25, 24, 13)>, <11, (14, 23, 3)>, <11, (14, 29, 17)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <14, (29, 11, 20)>, <14, (23, 20, 3)>, <14, (29, 17, 10)>, <14, (20, 6, 18)>, <14, (3, 18, 21)>, <14, (11, 13, 3)>, <14, (29, 8, 17)>, <14, (20, 14, 6)>, <14, (11, 13, 10)>, <14, (11, 25, 24)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <19, (22, 0, 24)>, <19, (27, 24, 1)>, <19, (22, 21, 18)>, <19, (0, 20, 14)>, <19, (24, 5, 6)>, <19, (22, 19, 1)>, <19, (27, 9, 15)>, <19, (24, 19, 1)>, <19, (0, 19, 28)>, <19, (27, 19, 1)>

- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <22, (19, 0, 24)>, <22, (2, 21, 18)>, <22, (19, 24, 5)>, <22, (21, 18, 6)>

- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <27, (9, 15, 19)>, <27, (15, 19, 1)>, <27, (19, 1, 28)>, <27, (9, 15, 4)>

- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <28, (8, 4, 7)>, <28, (0, 19, 1)>, <28, (7, 16, 26)>, <28, (1, 19, 22)>

- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  <29, (17, 10, 8)>, <29, (8, 20, 14)>, <29, (17, 12, 13)>, <29, (14, 23, 3)>

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes with more than 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50\). Thus, the final answer is [50].
