Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (2, 11) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the provided edges:

The graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Next, let's calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 8
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [ 10 + 56 + 10 + 10 ] = [ 86 ] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 9, 14)>
- <4, (8, 9, 14)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 14)>
- <4, (3, 8, 14)>
- <11, (3, 9, 13)>
- <11, (5, 9, 13)>
- <11, (3, 5, 13)>
- <11, (5, 1, 13)>
- <11, (1, 5, 13)>
- <11, (0, 13, 6)>
- <13, (1, 5, 6)>
- <13, (0, 1, 6)>
- <13, (0, 14, 6)>
- <14, (3, 6, 13)>
- <14, (3, 8, 13)>
