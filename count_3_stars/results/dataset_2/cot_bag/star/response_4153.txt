Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below for clarity:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: There are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: There are 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the possible 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 66 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 3>, <2, 3, 8>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <9, 1, 4>.
