Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 4 has 5 neighbors,
Node 5 has 4 neighbors,
Node 1 has 6 neighbors,
Node 3 has 4 neighbors,
Node 9 has 3 neighbors,
Node 2 has 5 neighbors,
Node 7 has 2 neighbors,
Node 8 has 3 neighbors,
Node 6 has 5 neighbors,
Node 0 has 4 neighbors.

So, we have:
- 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars at node 4
- 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars at node 5
- 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars at node 1
- 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars at node 3
- 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star at node 9
- 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars at node 2
- 0 3-star at node 7
- 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star at node 8
- 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars at node 6
- 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars at node 0

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [64].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (9, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 5, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 3)>
<6, (8, 1, 6)>
<0, (2, 0, 6)>
