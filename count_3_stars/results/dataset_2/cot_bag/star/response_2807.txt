Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
      0 -- 3 -- 11
     /|    |    | \
    9 4    1    12 7
     \     |     /|
      \    |    / |
        10--7--2--13  
              | 
              8           
               \
                14
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 4, 9, 10)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

2. Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9, 13)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

3. Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8, 11)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

4. Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 7, 9, 14)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

5. Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

6. Node 6 (neighbors: 5, 8, 13, 14)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

7. Node 7 (neighbors: 2, 4, 10, 12, 13)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

8. Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 14)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

9. Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 12)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

10. Node 10 (neighbors: 0, 7, 11)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

11. Node 11 (neighbors: 3, 10, 12)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

12. Node 12 (neighbors: 7, 9, 11)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

13. Node 13 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

14. Node 14 (neighbors: 4, 6, 8)
   - Total 3-stars: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

Adding up all the 3-stars formed around the nodes, we get a total of 48 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (7, 13, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (13, 8, 5)>
<7, (2, 12, 10)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<9, (0, 4, 12)>
<10, (0, 7, 11)>
<11, (3, 10, 12)>
<12, (9, 11, 7)>
<13, (6, 7, 2)>
<14, (4, 6, 8)>
