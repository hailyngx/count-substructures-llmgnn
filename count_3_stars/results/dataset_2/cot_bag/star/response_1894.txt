Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 11) (4, 8) (4, 20) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (21, 16) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 1) (5, 7) (5, 25) (5, 29) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (1, 23) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 24) (28, 10) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 19) (22, 27) (22, 3) (22, 14) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 17) (20, 4) (20, 9) (20, 12) (12, 14) (12, 20) (10, 28) (2, 23) (2, 11) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 8, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\[4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 37 \]

So, there are 37 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [37].

List of unique 3-stars: <0, (8, 14, 6)>, <3, (7, 25, 22)>, <16, (21, 17, 25)>, <17, (6, 2, 18)>, <18, (3, 23, 17)>, <22, (27, 3, 29)>, <23, (8, 1, 2)>, <24, (6, 28, 13)>, <25, (3, 5, 9)>, <26, (1, 14, 11)>, <27, (15, 22, 11)>.
