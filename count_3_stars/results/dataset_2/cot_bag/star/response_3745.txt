Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 29) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (8, 24) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 27) (25, 20) (25, 9) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 4) (29, 7) (29, 19) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 15) (0, 6) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 3) (28, 16) (28, 24) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 27) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 22) (18, 17) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 24) (4, 2) (4, 26) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 9) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 11) (3, 17) (3, 6) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 19) (27, 20) (27, 1) (27, 5) (11, 13) (11, 22) (23, 14) (23, 12) (23, 24) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
Given the provided information about the nodes and edges, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine how many 3-stars can be formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars formed:
\( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 49 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 49 3-stars in the provided graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 15, 20)>
<2, (4, 16, 26)>
<4, (2, 12, 26)>
<7, (14, 21, 29)>
<9, (19, 21, 25)>
<12, (13, 15, 23)>
<14, (7, 10, 23)>
<15, (0, 12, 24)>
<16, (2, 24, 28)>
<17, (2, 18, 3)>
<19, (9, 22, 29)>
<21, (7, 6, 9)>
<22, (19, 11, 16)>
<24, (8, 15, 23)>
<27, (1, 5, 20)> 

Putting the final count in brackets, we have a total of [49] 3-stars in the graph.
