Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 1: [1 3-star]
- Node 2: [4 3-stars]
- Node 3: [1 3-star]
- Node 4: [1 3-star]
- Node 5: [1 3-star]
- Node 6: [0 3-stars]
- Node 7: [1 3-star]
- Node 8: [3 3-stars]
- Node 9: [0 3-stars]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
