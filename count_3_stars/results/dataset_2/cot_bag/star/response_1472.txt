Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 94 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9, 13)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 12)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<5, (2, 6, 14)>, 
<6, (5, 8, 10)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 13)>, 
<11, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<12, (0, 2, 7)>.
