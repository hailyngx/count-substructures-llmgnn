Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

1. Node 0: 1 3-star
2. Node 1: 1 3-star
3. Node 3: 1 3-star
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 12: 1 3-star
10. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 17: 1 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 42 3-stars. So, the final answer is: [42]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (13, 15, 9)>, 
<1, (7, 3, 2)>, 
<3, (1, 12, 19)>, 
<4, (16, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (11, 13, 6)>, 
<7, (4, 0, 19)>, 
<8, (14, 4, 18)>, 
<9, (11, 16, 15)>, 
<12, (11, 3, 2)>, 
<13, (8, 5, 17)>, 
<15, (10, 14, 0)>, 
<16, (6, 4, 17)>, 
<17, (16, 13, 9)>
