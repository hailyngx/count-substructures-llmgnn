Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 16) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 19) (18, 12) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 17) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 1) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 16) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (2, 10) (2, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (15, 12) (15, 13) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges in this graph. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {11, 5, 14}
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {12, 16, 19}
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {11, 14, 7}
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {5, 6, 12, 19, 17}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {11, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {11, 4, 8}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {3, 13, 17}
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {3, 0, 5, 6}
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {4, 18, 15, 1, 19}
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {14, 7, 15}
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 19, 13}
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {8, 1, 17}
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 16}
- Node 18 has 1 neighbor
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {14, 4, 12, 1}

Now, let's list the 3-stars and count the total number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1 3-star formed <0, (11, 5, 14)>
- Node 1: 1 3-star formed <1, (12, 16, 19)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star formed <3, (11, 14, 7)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star formed <4, (5, 6, 12)> and 1 3-star formed <4, (5, 19, 17)> and 1 3-star formed <4, (6, 19, 17)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star formed <5, (11, 0, 14)>
- Node 6: 1 3-star formed <6, (11, 4, 8)>
- Node 7: 1 3-star formed <7, (3, 13, 17)>
- Node 11: 1 3-star formed <11, (3, 0, 5)> and 1 3-star formed <11, (3, 5, 6)> and 1 3-star formed <11, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 12: 1 3-star formed <12, (4, 18, 15)> and 1 3-star formed <12, (4, 15, 1)> and 1 3-star formed <12, (18, 15, 1)> and 1 3-star formed <12, (4, 19, 1)> and 1 3-star formed <12, (4, 19, 18)>
- Node 13: 1 3-star formed <13, (14, 7, 15)>
- Node 14: 1 3-star formed <14, (0, 3, 19)> and 1 3-star formed <14, (3, 19, 13)> and 1 3-star formed <14, (0, 19, 13)>
- Node 16: 1 3-star formed <16, (8, 1, 17)>
- Node 17: 1 3-star formed <17, (4, 7, 16)>
- Node 19: 1 3-star formed <19, (4, 12, 1)> and 1 3-star formed <19, (12, 1, 18)> and 1 3-star formed <19, (12, 1, 4)> and 1 3-star formed <19, (4, 12, 18)>

Counting up the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [18].
