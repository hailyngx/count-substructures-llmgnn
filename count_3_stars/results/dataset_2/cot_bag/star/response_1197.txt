This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (15, 5) (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 16) (8, 22) (13, 3) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 19) (18, 20) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 4) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 28) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 13) (17, 20) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 10) (29, 5) (29, 11) (10, 21) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 6) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 9) (12, 26) (12, 24) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 26) (22, 8) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 24) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 5) (9, 25) (9, 4) (28, 19) (28, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 29) (5, 24) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 26) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 21, 15, 27, 3, 25, 8, 13, 0, 14, 19, 26, 17, 20, 10, 4, 23, 11, 9, 28, 5, 16, and 24.
We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. For node 1, there are 3 edges connected to it: (1, 21), (1, 11), (1, 5). The number of 3-stars around node 1 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
2. For node 21, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 21 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
3. For node 15, there are 2 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 15 is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
4. For node 27, there are 2 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 27 is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
5. For node 3, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
6. For node 25, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 25 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
7. For node 8, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 8 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
8. For node 13, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 13 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
9. For node 0, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
10. For node 14, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 14 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
11. For node 19, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 19 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
12. For node 26, there are 5 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 26 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
13. For node 17, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 17 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
14. For node 20, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 20 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
15. For node 10, there are 5 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 10 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
16. For node 4, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
17. For node 23, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 23 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
18. For node 11, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 11 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
19. For node 9, there are 2 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 9 is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
20. For node 28, there are 2 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 28 is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
21. For node 5, there are 5 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
22. For node 16, there are 3 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 16 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
23. For node 24, there are 4 edges connected to it. The number of 3-stars around node 24 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the final answer is [55].
