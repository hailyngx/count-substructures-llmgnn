Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes based on the number of neighbors they have:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>
