Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 6) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 12) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the degree of the node:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 15, 7)>
- <3, (0, 15, 7)>
- <3, (15, 0, 14)>
- <3, (15, 7, 0)>
- <3, (15, 7, 13)>
- <3, (15, 0, 19)>
- <3, (7, 15, 0)>
- <3, (7, 15, 13)>
- <3, (7, 15, 6)>
- <7, (3, 15, 0)>
- <7, (3, 15, 13)>
- <7, (3, 15, 6)>
- <7, (15, 3, 0)>
- <7, (15, 3, 13)>
- <10, (12, 14, 6)>
- <10, (14, 12, 6)>
- <12, (16, 11, 4)>
- <12, (16, 4, 5)>
- <15, (3, 7, 0)>
- <15, (3, 7, 13)>
- <15, (3, 7, 6)>
- <15, (7, 3, 0)>
- <15, (7, 3, 13)>
