Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 17) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 20) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 22) (28, 14) (28, 20) (10, 21) (10, 9) (21, 10) (21, 0) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 4) (27, 25) (27, 7) (27, 23) (7, 16) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 20) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 25) (0, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 29) (18, 8) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 23) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 7) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 1) (19, 29) (19, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 24) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 22) (12, 18) (12, 24) (24, 14) (24, 12) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 23) (23, 27) (23, 29) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 21, 25, 4), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (3, 6, 14, 19, 0), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (25, 0, 6, 17, 23), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (13, 1, 4), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (16, 27, 29, 20), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (13, 10, 18), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (16, 5, 2), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (22, 18, 24), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (13, 1, 28, 2), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors (11, 7, 17, 5, 20), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (9, 12, 29, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors (1, 29, 2), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (16, 28, 7, 20), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors (27, 29, 4), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors (27, 0, 4, 18, 27), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors (25, 7, 23), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (22, 20, 14), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors (7, 18, 19, 23), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the combinations, we get a total of $4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 56$ 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is $[56]$ and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
