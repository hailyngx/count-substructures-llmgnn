Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars = [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (3, 9, 14)>
<1, (0, 10, 14)>
<3, (4, 7, 13)>
<10, (0, 6, 8)>
