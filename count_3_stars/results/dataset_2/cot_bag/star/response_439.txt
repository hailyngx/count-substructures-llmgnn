Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {9, 12, 3, 8}
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (9, 12, 3)> and <7, (9, 12, 8)> and <7, (9, 3, 8)> and <7, (12, 3, 8)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 8, 13, 14}
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (6, 8, 13)> and <2, (6, 8, 14)> and <2, (8, 13, 14)> and <2, (6, 13, 14)>

Node 8 has 6 neighbors: {7, 12, 2, 5, 0, 1}
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<8, (7, 12, 2)> and <8, (7, 12, 5)> and <8, (7, 12, 0)> and <8, (7, 12, 1)> and <8, (7, 2, 5)> and <8, (7, 2, 0)> and <8, (7, 2, 1)> and <8, (7, 5, 0)> and <8, (7, 5, 1)> and <8, (7, 0, 1)> and <8, (12, 2, 5)> and <8, (12, 2, 0)> and <8, (12, 2, 1)> and <8, (12, 5, 0)> and <8, (12, 5, 1)> and <8, (12, 0, 1)> and <8, (2, 5, 0)> and <8, (2, 5, 1)> and <8, (2, 0, 1)> and <8, (5, 0, 1)>

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: {9, 8, 10, 1}
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3}  = 4 \)
<0, (9, 8, 10)> and <0, (9, 8, 1)> and <0, (9, 10, 1)> and <0, (8, 10, 1)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {8, 0, 10, 5, 4}
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<1, (8, 0, 10)> and <1, (8, 0, 5)> and <1, (8, 0, 4)> and <1, (8, 10, 5)> and <1, (8, 10, 4)> and <1, (8, 5, 4)> and <1, (0, 10, 5)> and <1, (0, 10, 4)> and <1, (0, 5, 4)> and <1, (10, 5, 4)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {6, 14, 3, 10, 1}
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (6, 14, 3)> and <4, (6, 14, 10)> and <4, (6, 14, 1)> and <4, (6, 3, 10)> and <4, (6, 3, 1)> and <4, (6, 10, 1)> and <4, (14, 3, 10)> and <4, (14, 3, 1)> and <4, (14, 10, 1)> and <4, (3, 10, 1)>

Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {2, 11, 4, 10}
Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<14, (2, 11, 4)> and <14, (2, 11, 10)> and <14, (2, 4, 10)> and <14, (11, 4, 10)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars gives a total of 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].
