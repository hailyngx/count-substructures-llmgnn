Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, and 13.
        
        Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
        For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
        For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
        For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        
        Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 80
        
        Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [80].
        
        Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
        <0, (6, 14, 1)>
        <2, (6, 13, 11)>
        <3, (5, 8, 12)>
        <4, (6, 12, 10)>
        <5, (3, 9, 10)>
        <6, (0, 2, 8)>
        <9, (5, 6, 13)>
        <10, (5, 4, 12)>
        <12, (4, 7, 9)>
        <13, (6, 14, 2)>
