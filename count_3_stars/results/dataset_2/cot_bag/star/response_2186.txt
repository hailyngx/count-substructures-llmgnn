Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes by applying the formula 

\[ \binom{n}{3} \]

where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that specific node. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0: Neighbors (9, 4, 7, 5, 2)
- Node 1: Neighbors (9, 4, 7, 3, 8)
- Node 3: Neighbors (6, 9, 1, 5, 8)
- Node 7: Neighbors (9, 4, 0, 8, 5, 1)
- Node 8: Neighbors (7, 1, 3, 2)
- Node 9: Neighbors (3, 1, 7, 0)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 58 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (6, 9, 1)>
- <7, (9, 4, 8)>
- <7, (9, 1, 5)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- <8, (7, 1, 3)>
- <9, (3, 7, 0)>
- <9, (3, 1, 7)>
