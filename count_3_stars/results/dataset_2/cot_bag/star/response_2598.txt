Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For node 1, there are edges connecting it to nodes 10, 5, 6, and 2, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 4, there are edges connecting it to nodes 11, 14, and 12, forming 1 3-star.
For node 6, there are edges connecting it to nodes 11, 5, and 0, forming 1 3-star.
For node 8, there are edges connecting it to nodes 5, 0, 14, and 2, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 9, there are edges connecting it to nodes 0, 14, 7, and 13, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 10, there are edges connecting it to nodes 11, 12, 1, 13, and 14, forming 10 3-stars.
For node 11, there are edges connecting it to nodes 10, 14, 6, and 4, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 12, there are edges connecting it to nodes 10, 3, 4, and 13, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 13, there are edges connecting it to nodes 10, 9, 4, and 12, forming 4 3-stars.
For node 14, there are edges connecting it to nodes 10, 11, 0, 8, 9, and 4, forming 15 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of 47 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
