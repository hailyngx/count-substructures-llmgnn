Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 17) (9, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (0, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 6) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (3, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 12) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, there are 35 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [35]
