Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to construct 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (9), (2), (12), (4)
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 12, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (12, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 12, 2)>
    
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (5), (8), (11), (13)
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 11)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>
    
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (5), (7), (8), (0)
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (4), (12), (14), (13), (8)
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (4, 12, 14)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 12, 8)>, <7, (4, 14, 13)>, <7, (4, 14, 8)>, <7, (4, 13, 8)>, <7, (12, 14, 13)>, <7, (12, 14, 8)>, <7, (12, 13, 8)>, <7, (14, 13, 8)>

- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: (5), (7), (2), (0), (11)
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <12, (5, 7, 2)>, <12, (5, 7, 0)>, <12, (5, 7, 11)>, <12, (5, 2, 0)>, <12, (5, 2, 11)>, <12, (5, 0, 11)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 11)>, <12, (7, 0, 11)>, <12, (2, 0, 11)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 32. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 12, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (12, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 12, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 11)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (4, 12, 14)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 12, 8)>, <7, (4, 14, 13)>, <7, (4, 14, 8)>, <7, (4, 13, 8)>, <7, (12, 14, 13)>, <7, (12, 14, 8)>, <7, (12, 13, 8)>, <7, (14, 13, 8)>, <12, (5, 7, 2)>, <12, (5, 7, 0)>, <12, (5, 7, 11)>, <12, (5, 2, 0)>, <12, (5, 2, 11)>, <12, (5, 0, 11)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 11)>, <12, (7, 0, 11)>, <12, (2, 0, 11)>.
