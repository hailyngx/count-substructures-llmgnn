Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges can be represented as follows:

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so that we can find 3-stars. 
Looking at the adjacency list, nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\), 

Number of 3-stars for node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 15: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 16: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 17: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Number of 3-stars for node 18: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing up all the 3-stars for each node:  
\(10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 53\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (6, 10, 18)>  
<2, (12, 14, 15)>  
<4, (11, 13, 19)>  
<6, (1, 7, 9)>  
<8, (0, 11, 18)>  
<9, (5, 12, 13)>  
<13, (4, 9, 15)>  
<15, (1, 7, 13)>  
<17, (1, 3, 15)>  
<18, (1, 10, 14)>
