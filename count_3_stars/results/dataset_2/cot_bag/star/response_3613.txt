Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Since node 1 has only 2 neighbors).

2. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
   <3, (11, 19, 12)>

3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <4, (9, 15, 13)>

4. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <5, (8, 18, 12)>

5. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <10, (17, 15, 6)>, <10, (17, 7, 15)>, <10, (17, 6, 7)>, <10, (15, 4, 7)>

6. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <11, (1, 19, 3)>

7. Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <12, (3, 5, 18)>, <12, (3, 15, 16)>, <12, (3, 18, 19)>, <12, (5, 15, 18)>, <12, (5, 18, 16)>,
   <12, (15, 18, 16)>, <12, (16, 18, 19)>, <12, (16, 18, 15)>, <12, (16, 18, 3)>, <12, (18, 19, 3)>

8. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <15, (10, 12, 4)>, <15, (10, 4, 9)>, <15, (10, 4, 12)>, <15, (12, 4, 9)>

9. Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Since node 16 has only 2 neighbors).

10. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <17, (14, 10, 7)>, <17, (14, 7, 6)>, <17, (10, 7, 6)>, <17, (7, 6, 14)>

11. Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <18, (5, 12, 19)>, <18, (5, 12, 16)>, <18, (5, 19, 0)>, <18, (5, 19, 18)>, <18, (5, 16, 12)>,
    <18, (12, 16, 19)>, <18, (12, 16, 3)>, <18, (12, 19, 0)>, <18, (16, 19, 3)>, <18, (16, 3, 12)>


Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10]

Total number of 3-stars = [36]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 19, 12)>, <4, (9, 15, 13)>, <5, (8, 18, 12)>, 
<10, (17, 15, 6)>, <10, (17, 7, 15)>, <10, (17, 6, 7)>, <10, (15, 4, 7)>, 
<11, (1, 19, 3)>,
<12, (3, 5, 18)>, <12, (3, 15, 16)>, <12, (3, 18, 19)>, <12, (5, 15, 18)>, <12, (5, 18, 16)>,
<12, (15, 18, 16)>, <12, (16, 18, 19)>, <12, (16, 18, 15)>, <12, (16, 18, 3)>, <12, (18, 19, 3)>,
<15, (10, 12, 4)>, <15, (10, 4, 9)>, <15, (10, 4, 12)>, <15, (12, 4, 9)>,
<17, (14, 10, 7)>, <17, (14, 7, 6)>, <17, (10, 7, 6)>, <17, (7, 6, 14)>,
<18, (5, 12, 19)>, <18, (5, 12, 16)>, <18, (5, 19, 0)>, <18, (5, 19, 18)>, <18, (5, 16, 12)>,
<18, (12, 16, 19)>, <18, (12, 16, 3)>, <18, (12, 19, 0)>, <18, (16, 19, 3)>, <18, (16, 3, 12)>
