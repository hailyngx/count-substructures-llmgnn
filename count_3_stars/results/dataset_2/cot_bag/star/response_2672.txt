Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (7, 4), (7, 2), (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 2), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors: [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 35 = 77

Hence, the final answer is [77].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 0, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>
