Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 11, 5, 9, 19, 8, 1, 7, 15, 18, 6, 17, 14, 2, 12, 10, 0, 4, and 13. Each of these nodes can form 3-star graphs.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 17 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <5, (1, 15, 18)>, <9, (11, 16, 15)>, <1, (5, 6, 13)>, <10, (13, 14, 19)>, <1, (5, 1, 13)>, <11, (8, 4, 9)>, <10, (7, 13, 14)>, <5, (1, 5, 19)>, <10, (7, 10, 14)>, <4, (0, 4, 10)>.
