Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 4) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 11, 13
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 14
- Node 2: 10, 17, 18
- Node 3: 4, 5, 14
- Node 4: 3, 6, 16, 17
- Node 5: 3, 11, 16
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 12, 13
- Node 8: 11, 13
- Node 9: 13, 14, 17, 19
- Node 10: 2, 15
- Node 11: 0, 5, 8, 15
- Node 12: 7, 17, 18
- Node 13: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 14: 1, 3, 9
- Node 15: 10, 11, 16
- Node 16: 4, 5, 15
- Node 17: 2, 4, 9, 12
- Node 18: 2, 12
- Node 19: 9

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars originating from each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [2]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [2]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [2]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [3]
- Node 10: [0]
- Node 11: [2]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [3]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 17: [2]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [0]

Adding these up, we have a total of 21 unique 3-stars, which can be represented as: 
<0, (1, 11, 13)>, <1, (0, 7, 14)>, <1, (3, 9, 14)>, <4, (3, 16, 17)>, <4, (6, 16, 17)>, <7, (1, 12, 13)>, <8, (11, 13, 9)>, <9, (13, 14, 17)>, <9, (13, 17, 19)>, <9, (14, 17, 19)>, <11, (0, 5, 15)>, <11, (5, 8, 15)>, <13, (0, 7, 8)>, <13, (0, 7, 9)>, <13, (7, 9, 19)>, <14, (1, 3, 9)>, <15, (10, 11, 16)>, <16, (3, 5, 15)>, <17, (4, 9, 12)>, <17, (4, 12, 13)>, <17, (9, 12, 13)>.
