Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 4) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 25) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 13) (14, 20) (14, 27) (14, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 26) (13, 29) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 9) (17, 26) (28, 26) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 21) (16, 21) (16, 18) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 2) (12, 25) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 11) (24, 21) (24, 10) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 9) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 10) (27, 14) (27, 9) (11, 18) (23, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 with 4 neighbors
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors
- Node 9 with 5 neighbors
- Node 10 with 4 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors
- Node 14 with 3 neighbors
- Node 15 with 3 neighbors
- Node 19 with 4 neighbors
- Node 20 with 4 neighbors
- Node 21 with 5 neighbors
- Node 22 with 3 neighbors
- Node 25 with 4 neighbors
- Node 26 with 4 neighbors
- Node 28 with 3 neighbors
- Node 29 with 5 neighbors

Applying the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\) to each of these nodes, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars centered at each of those nodes, resulting in the following:
\[ [ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} ]\]

\[ = [ 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 ] = [50] \]

Therefore, there are a total of 50 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
2. <4, (8, 19, 21)>
3. <5, (1, 6, 29)>
4. <6, (5, 13, 15)>
5. <9, (1, 18, 25)>
6. <10, (3, 24, 29)>
7. <12, (2, 19, 29)>
8. <13, (6, 26, 29)>
9. <14, (7, 19, 27)>
10. <15, (4, 6, 19)>
11. <19, (8, 15, 29)>
12. <20, (0, 14, 29)>
13. <21, (4, 16, 26)>
14. <22, (2, 3, 21)>
15. <25, (5, 9, 12)>
16. <26, (13, 17, 21)>
17. <28, (9, 18, 27)>
18. <29, (10, 12, 20)>
