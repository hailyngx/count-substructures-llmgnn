Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 5, node 9, and node 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 1, 11, and 14. This gives us \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. 
List of unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: 
<5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 11)>, <5, (9, 2, 14)>, <5, (9, 1, 11)>, <5, (9, 1, 14)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <5, (2, 1, 11)>, <5, (2, 1, 14)>, <5, (2, 11, 14)>, <5, (1, 11, 14)>

2. Node 9:
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 3, 13, and 12. This gives us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
List of unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 
<9, (5, 3, 13)>, <9, (5, 3, 12)>, <9, (5, 13, 12)>, <9, (3, 13, 12)>

3. Node 1:
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 5, 8, 11, 0, 10, and 13. This gives us \( \binom{6}{9} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
List of unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
<1, (5, 8, 11)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 10)>, <1, (5, 8, 13)>, <1, (5, 11, 0)>, <1, (5, 11, 10)>, <1, (5, 11, 13)>, <1, (5, 0, 10)>, <1, (5, 0, 13)>, <1, (5, 10, 13)>, <1, (8, 11, 0)>, <1, (8, 11, 10)>, <1, (8, 11, 13)>, <1, (8, 0, 10)>, <1, (8, 0, 13)>, <1, (8, 10, 13)>, <1, (11, 0, 10)>, <1, (11, 0, 13)>, <1, (11, 10, 13)>, <1, (0, 10, 13)>

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
