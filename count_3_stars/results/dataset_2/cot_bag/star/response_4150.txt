Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 1, 6. Hence, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 0. 
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 3, 1)>, <0, (5, 3, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (3, 1, 6)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 8. Hence, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 2.
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (5, 9, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 8, 0, 6. Hence, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 3.
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (4, 0, 6)>, <3, (8, 0, 6)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 6, 2. Hence, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (9, 3, 6)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (3, 6, 2)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 0, 3. Hence, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 0, 1. Hence, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 7.
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 8, 1)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, 1, 7. Hence, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 9.
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
