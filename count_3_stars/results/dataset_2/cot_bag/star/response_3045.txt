Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are a few nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56

So, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 10, 14)>
<0, (5, 10, 0)>
<0, (5, 10, 8)>
<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<0, (3, 7, 13)>
<3, (1, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 3, 11)>
<3, (1, 3, 14)>
<3, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (10, 11, 4)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 1, 11)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (4, 11, 13)>
<8, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (3, 1, 11)>
<13, (4, 7, 13)>
<14, (3, 0, 13)>
