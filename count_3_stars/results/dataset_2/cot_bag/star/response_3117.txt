Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 16) (12, 11) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 17) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 15) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7, 6) -> [1 3-star] -> <0, (1, 7, 6)>
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (9, 0, 2, 10) -> [4 3-stars] -> <1, (9, 0, 2)>, <1, (9, 0, 10)>, <1, (9, 2, 10)>, <1, (0, 2, 10)>
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 10) -> [1 3-star] -> <2, (1, 4, 10)>
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (6, 10, 17) -> [1 3-star] -> <3, (6, 10, 17)>
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (11, 15, 18) -> [1 3-star] -> <5, (11, 15, 18)>
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3, 11) -> [1 3-star] -> <6, (0, 3, 11)>
7. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (1, 14, 18) -> [1 3-star] -> <9, (1, 14, 18)>
8. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (4, 19, 3, 1, 2) -> [10 3-stars] -> <10, (4, 19, 3)>, <10, (4, 19, 1)>, <10, (4, 19, 2)>, <10, (4, 3, 1)>, <10, (4, 3, 2)>, <10, (19, 3, 1)>, <10, (19, 3, 2)>, <10, (1, 2, 3)>, <10, (1, 2, 19)>, <10, (1, 2, 4)>
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (6, 5, 15, 12) -> [4 3-stars] -> <11, (6, 5, 15)>, <11, (6, 5, 12)>, <11, (6, 5, 12)>, <11, (15, 5, 12)>
10. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (19, 14, 9, 5) -> [4 3-stars] -> <18, (19, 14, 9)>, <18, (19, 14, 5)>, <18, (19, 14, 5)>, <18, (9, 14, 5)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 10 + 4 + 4] = [28] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 7, 6)>, <1, (9, 0, 2)>, <1, (9, 0, 10)>, <1, (9, 2, 10)>, <1, (0, 2, 10)>, <2, (1, 4, 10)>, <3, (6, 10, 17)>, <5, (11, 15, 18)>, <6, (0, 3, 11)>, <9, (1, 14, 18)>, <10, (4, 19, 3)>, <10, (4, 19, 1)>, <10, (4, 19, 2)>, <10, (4, 3, 1)>, <10, (4, 3, 2)>, <10, (19, 3, 1)>, <10, (19, 3, 2)>, <10, (1, 2, 3)>, <10, (1, 2, 19)>, <10, (1, 2, 4)>, <11, (6, 5, 15)>, <11, (6, 5, 12)>, <11, (15, 5, 12)>, <18, (19, 14, 9)>, <18, (19, 14, 5)>, <18, (9, 14, 5)>
