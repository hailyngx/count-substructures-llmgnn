Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (22, 5) (22, 28) (23, 25) (23, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (20, 15) (20, 2) (5, 16) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 3) (26, 27) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 21) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 29) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 1) (21, 16) (21, 8) (21, 24) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 28) (3, 13) (3, 4) (24, 21) (24, 7) (7, 9) (7, 24) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 25) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 1) (29, 11) (29, 19) (29, 0) (28, 22) (28, 14) (0, 18) (0, 29) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them first:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 10, 12, 25
- Node 5 has neighbors: 13, 16, 22
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 4, 13, 15
- Node 8 has neighbors: 17, 18, 19, 21
- Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 15, 17
- Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 16, 25, 29
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 15, 25
- Node 13 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 17
- Node 14 has neighbors: 9, 16, 28
- Node 15 has neighbors: 6, 10, 12, 20, 27
- Node 16 has neighbors: 5, 11, 14, 17, 21
- Node 17 has neighbors: 8, 10, 13, 16
- Node 19 has neighbors: 8, 23, 29
- Node 21 has neighbors: 8, 16, 24
- Node 25 has neighbors: 1, 11, 12, 23
- Node 27 has neighbors: 2, 15, 26
- Node 29 has neighbors: 0, 11, 19

We only consider nodes with three or more neighbors for forming 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 50 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 50 unique 3-stars in the graph. Inside brackets, this is written as [50]. 
The unique 3-stars are as follows:

<1, (10, 15, 17)>
