Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges: 
- 0: (5, 0), (9, 0), (4, 0), (14, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)
- 1: (9, 1), (4, 1), (10, 1), (0, 1), (6, 1)
- 2: (5, 2), (7, 2), (12, 2), (0, 2), (3, 2)
- 3: (10, 3), (2, 3)
- 4: (7, 4), (8, 4), (1, 4), (11, 4)
- 5: (2, 5), (11, 5), (0, 5)

- 10: (13, 10), (10, 11), (10, 3), (10, 6), (10, 1), (14, 10)
- 11: (5, 11), (4, 11), (10, 11), (11, 12)
- 12: (7, 12), (12, 13), (12, 11), (12, 2), (14, 12), (0, 12)
- 13: (13, 8), (6, 13), (10, 13)
- 14: (10, 14), (14, 0), (14, 12)

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 83 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 83, which can be represented as [83].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 1, 5)>, <1, (9, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (11, 0, 2)>, <6, (13, 10, 1)>, <7, (12, 2, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 13)>, <10, (13, 6, 1)>, <11, (5, 4, 10)>, <12, (14, 7, 13)>, <13, (6, 10, 8)>, <14, (0, 12, 10)>.
