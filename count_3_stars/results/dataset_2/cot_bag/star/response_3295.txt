Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors based on the given edges. Then, we can calculate \( inom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 14, 15, 17, 18.

For node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 17: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 18: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the counts for each node: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

So, there are 24 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (12, 9, 10)>
<14, (10, 5, 17)>
<15, (9, 11, 7)>
<17, (13, 3, 9)>
<18, (6, 2, 16)>

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
