Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 19) (15, 4) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 9) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 4) (24, 22) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 0) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 27) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 2) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 11) (22, 24) (22, 8) (10, 26) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 24) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 23) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 0) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 13) (0, 23) (20, 12) (20, 19) (27, 1) (18, 5) (18, 25) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 23) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61].
