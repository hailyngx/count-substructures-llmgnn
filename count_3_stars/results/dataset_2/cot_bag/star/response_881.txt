Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- For node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 1: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 2: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 3: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 5: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 6: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
- For node 8: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 9: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 10: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 11: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- For node 12: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- For node 13: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 14: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 59 3-stars.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (1, 9, 10)>
<2, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (0, 3, 13)>
<9, (1, 7, 10)>
<11, (0, 3, 14)>
<12, (0, 4, 8)>
<14, (1, 10, 12)>
<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 10, 14)>
<13, (3, 4, 10)>
<3, (0, 4, 11)>
<8, (4, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
