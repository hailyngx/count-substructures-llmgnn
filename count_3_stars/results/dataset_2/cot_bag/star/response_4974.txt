Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (12, 4) (6, 19) (6, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are cases in the graph where a node has more than three edges connecting it to other nodes. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in such cases and then list the unique 3-stars formed:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3, 1, 5). It forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (18, 15, 14). It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (16, 18, 12). It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 8, 19). It forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9, 17). It forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (5, 0, 19). It forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (2, 19, 13). It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
8. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (1, 19, 10). It forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (16, 2, 4). It forms 1 3-star.
10. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (11, 3, 4). It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
11. Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (4, 7, 17). It forms 1 3-star.
12. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 0). It forms 1 3-star.
13. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: (5, 8, 10). It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes with more than three neighbors, we get a total of 33 3-stars in the graph: \([1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [33]\).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars formed in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 1, 5)>, <2, (18, 15, 14)>, <4, (16, 18, 12)>, <5, (1, 8, 19)>, <7, (6, 9, 17)>, <8, (5, 0, 19)>, <10, (2, 19, 13)>, <13, (1, 19, 10)>, <14, (16, 2, 4)>, <16, (11, 3, 4)>, <17, (4, 7, 17)>, <18, (2, 4, 0)>, <19, (5, 8, 10)>.
