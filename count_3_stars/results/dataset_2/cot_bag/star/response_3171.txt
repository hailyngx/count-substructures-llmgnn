Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3

We see that the nodes 4, 5, 11, and 17 have degrees at least 3, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars each can form.

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <4, (13, 16, 5)>
  - <4, (13, 19, 4)>
  - <4, (13, 5, 18)>
  - <4, (13, 5, 17)>
  - <4, (13, 5, 4)>
  - <4, (16, 13, 4)>
  - <4, (16, 4, 5)>
  - <4, (16, 4, 10)>
  - <4, (16, 5, 18)>
  - <4, (16, 5, 17)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <5, (2, 18, 5)>
  - <5, (2, 5, 17)>
  - <5, (2, 5, 4)>
  - <5, (2, 5, 18)>
  - <5, (2, 5, 17)>
  - <5, (13, 16, 5)>
  - <5, (13, 19, 4)>
  - <5, (13, 5, 18)>
  - <5, (13, 5, 17)>
  - <5, (13, 5, 4)>

For Node 11:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <11, (15, 12, 11)>
  - <11, (15, 11, 9)>
  - <11, (12, 10, 11)>
  - <11, (12, 6, 11)>

For Node 17:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <17, (1, 9, 11)>
  - <17, (1, 9, 11)>
  - <17, (1, 9, 11)>
  - <17, (1, 9, 11)>
  - <17, (1, 9, 11)>
  - <17, (7, 6, 17)>
  - <17, (7, 17, 19)>
  - <17, (7, 17, 5)>
  - <17, (7, 17, 4)>
  - <17, (7, 19, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [34].
