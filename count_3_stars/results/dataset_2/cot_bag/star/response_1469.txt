Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 15) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 2, 4
Node 1: 10, 11
Node 2: 0, 7, 17 
Node 3: 5, 7
Node 4: 0, 17
Node 5: 3, 12, 15, 19
Node 6: 10, 12, 16, 19
Node 7: 2, 3, 12, 13
Node 8: 15, 17, 18
Node 10: 1, 6, 11, 13
Node 11: 1, 10, 18
Node 12: 5, 6, 7, 14, 17
Node 13: 7, 10, 15, 19
Node 14: 12, 16
Node 15: 5, 8, 13, 16
Node 16: 6, 14, 15
Node 17: 2, 4, 8, 12
Node 18: 8, 11
Node 19: 5, 6, 13

Now we will analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (3, 12, 15)>, <5, (12, 15, 19)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (2, 12, 13)>
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: <10, (1, 11, 13)>
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: <12, (5, 7, 14)>, <12, (5, 6, 16)>, <12, (7, 14, 17)>, <12, (7, 12, 17)>
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: <13, (7, 10, 15)>
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: <15, (5, 13, 16)>
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: <17, (8, 12, 18)>
Node 18 has 2 neighbors.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: <19, (5, 13, 6)>

In total, there are 12 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
