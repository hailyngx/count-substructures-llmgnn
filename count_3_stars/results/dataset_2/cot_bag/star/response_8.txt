Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possibilities, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66 \) which can be represented as [66].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 2, 14>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 11, 13>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 10>
- <3, 7, 10>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <7, 9, 14>
- <13, 5, 6>
- <13, 5, 8>
- <13, 5, 0>
- <13, 5, 2>
- <13, 6, 14>
- <14, 6, 3>
