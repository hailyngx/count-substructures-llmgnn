Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (18, 22) (18, 4) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 28) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 20) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 7) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (14, 26) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 13) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 9) (8, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 20) (29, 22) (29, 26) (29, 7) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 9) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 7) (23, 1) (23, 25) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 23) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 27) (24, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 24) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 18, 22, 21, 10, 11, 19, 5, 4, 0, 16, 26, 2, 12, 28, 7, 29, 1, 25, 9, 13, 17, and 27.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors but has a loop with one of them, so it effectively has 2 neighbors, hence cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4+4+10+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+10+1+1+4+10+1+4+4+4+1+1 = 53.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53]. 

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars: 
<3, (15, 21, 28)>, <15, (3, 8, 2)>, <21, (3, 22, 10)>, <10, (21, 26, 28)>, <11, (19, 17, 20)>, <19, (11, 5, 28)>, <5, (19, 12, 7)>, <4, (18, 16, 17)>, <0, (21, 16, 9)>, <16, (4, 0, 25)>, <26, (10, 14, 20)>, <2, (15, 27, 7)>, <12, (5, 21, 13)>, <28, (3, 10, 19)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <29, (22, 26, 7)>, <1, (25, 23, 13)>, <25, (16, 26, 1)>, <9, (0, 28, 1)>, <13, (12, 1, 27)>, <17, (11, 4, 24)>, <27, (3, 2, 13)>.
