Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's determine the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Thus, there are 52 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the final answer is [52].
