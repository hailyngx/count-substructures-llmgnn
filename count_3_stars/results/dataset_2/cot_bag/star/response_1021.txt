Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 0: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
<0, (4, 9, 13)> <0, (4, 10, 13)> <0, (7, 9, 13)> <0, (7, 10, 13)> <0, (4, 10, 9)><br>
<0, (9, 13, 10)> <0, (4, 11, 13)> <0, (10, 4, 9)> <0, (4, 7, 13)> <0, (10, 13, 4)>

For node 3: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
<3, (1, 9, 10)> <3, (1, 10, 14)> <3, (1, 12, 10)> <3, (1, 10, 4)> <3, (10, 4, 14)><br>
<3, (1, 4, 10)> <3, (1, 12, 14)> <3, (1, 14, 2)> <3, (10, 12, 4)> <3, (4, 12, 10)>

For node 4: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
<4, (0, 9, 7)> <4, (0, 10, 13)> <4, (0, 7, 13)> <4, (0, 7, 10)> <4, (9, 0, 13)><br>
<4, (0, 10, 9)> <4, (9, 0, 7)> <4, (0, 10, 11)> <4, (7, 10, 13)> <4, (0, 13, 10)>

For node 5: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
<5, (8, 12, 6)> <5, (8, 12, 3)> <5, (8, 14, 12)> <5, (8, 12, 5)> <5, (12, 8, 6)><br>
<5, (12, 8, 3)> <5, (12, 6, 8)> <5, (12, 14, 8)> <5, (12, 6, 9)> <5, (8, 12, 14)>

For node 9: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
<9, (0, 4, 13)> <9, (0, 4, 10)> <9, (0, 13, 4)> <9, (4, 0, 13)> <9, (0, 7, 4)><br>
<9, (0, 13, 10)> <9, (4, 13, 10)> <9, (0, 13, 7)> <9, (4, 13, 0)> <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 50.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [50].
