Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 21) (6, 3) (6, 20) (6, 27) (8, 15) (8, 23) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (27, 6) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 29) (26, 21) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (21, 5) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 0) (28, 2) (17, 13) (17, 7) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 14) (7, 17) (25, 4) (25, 19) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 0) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 29) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 20) (14, 11) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 10) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 26) (29, 4) (29, 11) (22, 8) (22, 27) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 13) (24, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
8. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
15. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
16. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
17. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
18. Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
19. Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4*14 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [76].
