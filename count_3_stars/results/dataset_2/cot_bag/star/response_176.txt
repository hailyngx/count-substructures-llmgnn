Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 3 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed, we get: \[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3] = [17] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (7, 1, 14)>
- <2, (13, 5, 0)>
- <3, (14, 12, 11)>
- <4, (8, 5, 6)>
- <5, (6, 4, 14)>
- <6, (5, 11, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 14)>
- <10, (11, 4, 2)>
- <11, (6, 12, 14)>
- <12, (7, 3, 14)>
- <13, (0, 2, 6)>
- <14, (4, 3, 11)>
