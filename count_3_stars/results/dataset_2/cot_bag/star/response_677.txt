Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5  
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 2: 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9  
Node 4: 3, 6, 9  
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 6: 1, 4, 5  
Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 9  
Node 8: 1, 5, 7  
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7  

Since all nodes have three or more neighbors, we will check each node for the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with node 1: <0, (1, 3, 5)>  
Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>  
Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>  
Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 3: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 8)>  
Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 2 and 9: <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>  
Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>  

Adding all the unique 3-stars found gives:

[14]  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>
