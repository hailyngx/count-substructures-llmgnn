Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 58 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 58. 

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)> 

So, the final answer is [58].
