Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes connected in the specific way mentioned by the edges provided:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
