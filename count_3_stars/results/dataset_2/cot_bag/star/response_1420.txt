Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
1: 10, 14, 8, 7
2: 10, 4, 8, 0
3: 9, 4, 8, 5, 13
4: 2, 3, 8, 5
5: 4, 3, 7, 13, 12
6: 9, 14, 8
7: 5, 13, 1, 9
8: 3, 4, 2, 10, 11, 1
9: 6, 14, 10, 3, 7
10: 9, 11, 1, 2
11: 10, 8
12: 0, 14, 5
13: 5, 3, 7
14: 6, 9, 1, 12

Now, we count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 5, 13)>, <7, (5, 1, 13)>, <8, (1, 10, 11)>, <8, (1, 10, 2)>, <8, (1, 11, 10)>, <8, (1, 2, 10)>, <8, (10, 1, 2)>, 
<8, (10, 2, 1)>, <9, (7, 10, 14)>, <9, (10, 14, 7)>, <9, (14, 10, 7)>, <9, (14, 7, 10)>, <10, (1, 8, 14)>, <12, (0, 5, 14)>
