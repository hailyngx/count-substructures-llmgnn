Response:
Given a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars present in the graph. We will use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 45 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 45 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (13, 20, 4)>
<0, (13, 4, 16)>
<0, (13, 4, 5)>
<0, (20, 29, 15)>
<0, (20, 15, 2)>
<4, (22, 27, 0)>
<4, (22, 14, 1)>
<4, (22, 14, 5)>
<4, (4, 0, 16)>
<10, (0, 24, 6)>
<11, (1, 11, 3)>
<12, (17, 19, 7)>
<14, (26, 5, 16)>
<14, (26, 5, 4)>
<14, (26, 13, 1)>
<14, (26, 13, 22)>
<15, (20, 7, 2)>
<15, (20, 29, 2)>
<15, (20, 29, 18)>
<15, (21, 26, 15)>
<16, (0, 27, 16)>
<17, (1, 4, 3)>
<19, (10, 12, 7)>
<20, (0, 4, 16)>
<20, (0, 13, 4)>
<20, (15, 7, 2)>
<20, (15, 21, 2)>
<22, (9, 14, 27)>
<22, (9, 14, 4)>
<26, (21, 15, 26)>
<26, (21, 15, 5)>
<29, (18, 1, 29)> 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
