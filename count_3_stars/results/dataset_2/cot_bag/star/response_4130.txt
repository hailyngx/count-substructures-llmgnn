Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 4, 7, 6, 8, 3, 2, 9, and 1. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 44 3-stars [44]. These 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 0)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (6, 0, 2)>, <4, (6, 0, 9)>, <4, (6, 2, 5)>, <4, (6, 2, 7)>, <4, (6, 2, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 7)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 2, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, and <8, (3, 7, 9)>
