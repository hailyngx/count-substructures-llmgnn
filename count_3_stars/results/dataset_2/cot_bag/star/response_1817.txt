Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (this node has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 61 3-stars.

Therefore, there are 61 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 10)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 10, 13)>
<0, (5, 7, 13)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (8, 11, 13)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 10, 13)>
<6, (4, 12, 14)>
<7, (0, 5, 13)>
<10, (0, 1, 14)>
<11, (3, 10, 13)>
<13, (7, 11, 14)> 

So, the final answer is [61].
