Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 12) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 19) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 12) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are five nodes (4, 7, 14, 8, and 13) with three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors (7, 6, 15, 4), so the number of 3-stars around node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7), so the number of 3-stars around node 7 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 14, there are 5 neighbors (17, 11, 3, 2, 10), so the number of 3-stars around node 14 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors (13, 16, 3, 8), so the number of 3-stars around node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 13, there are 4 neighbors (1, 19, 6, 8), so the number of 3-stars around node 13 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [23] \).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<4, (15, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 15)>, <14, (17, 2, 10)>, <8, (13, 3, 16)>, <13, (1, 6, 8)>
