Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 29) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 27) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 23) (6, 7) (6, 5) (29, 11) (29, 27) (29, 0) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 29) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 24) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 27) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 19) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 25) (13, 2) (13, 25) (21, 11) (21, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 20) (1, 19) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 3) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 1) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (3, 26) (3, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars from each of these nodes, we get a total of 96 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [96]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 29)>, <0, (10, 16, 29)>, <0, (10, 2, 29)>, <0, (10, 5, 29)>, <0, (2, 16, 29)>, <0, (2, 5, 10)>, <1, (4, 18, 20)>, <2, (0, 10, 29)>, <2, (0, 13, 24)>, <2, (10, 13, 24)>, <2, (13, 24, 25)>, <3, (12, 20, 26)>, <4, (1, 18, 20)>, <6, (5, 7, 23)>, <8, (15, 23, 24)>, <11, (10, 15, 21)>, <12, (3, 9, 25)>, <14, (18, 27, 29)>, <17, (21, 24, 27)>, <19, (1, 4, 25)>, <24, (2, 4, 17)>, <25, (12, 19, 27)>
