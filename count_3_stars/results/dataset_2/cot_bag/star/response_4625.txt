Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 8.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 13.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 14.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 95

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [95].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 13, 14)>, <2, (10, 13, 2)>, <3, (6, 11, 12)>, <3, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (10, 11, 12)>, <3, (10, 6, 12)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 14)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <11, (6, 13, 12)>.
