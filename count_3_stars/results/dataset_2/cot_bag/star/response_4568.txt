Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 13) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <1, (2, 4, 17)>, <1, (2, 17, 10)>, <1, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (4, 17, 10)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <2, (8, 14, 1)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <3, (7, 14, 19)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 19)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <6, (7, 11, 4)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <8, (15, 12, 2)>

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  <10, (17, 1, 14)>, <10, (17, 1, 18)>, <10, (17, 14, 2)>, <10, (17, 11, 6)>

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <11, (17, 13, 6)>

- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  <13, (14, 16, 0)>, <13, (14, 11, 17)>, <13, (16, 18, 13)>, <13, (16, 13, 0)>

- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
  <14, (2, 18, 13)>, <14, (2, 18, 16)>, <14, (2, 18, 17)>, <14, (10, 17, 13)>, <14, (10, 17, 18)>, <14, (10, 17, 6)>, <14, (13, 18, 16)>, <14, (13, 18, 17)>, <14, (13, 16, 17)>, <14, (18, 16, 17)>

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  <16, (18, 13, 14)>, <16, (18, 13, 16)>, <16, (18, 13, 17)>, <16, (18, 14, 13)>

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  <17, (10, 11, 13)>, <17, (10, 14, 2)>, <17, (10, 14, 18)>, <17, (11, 13, 6)>

- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <18, (14, 16, 17)>

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  <19, (3, 5, 16)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
