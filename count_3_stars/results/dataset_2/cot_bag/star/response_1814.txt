Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars based on the combinatorial formula mentioned earlier. Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors [5, 1, 6, 12, 7]
2. Node 1: Neighbors [5, 4, 11, 0]
3. Node 2: Neighbors [5, 3, 11, 8, 6, 14]
4. Node 3: Neighbors [9, 2, 12, 8]
5. Node 4: Neighbors [9, 7, 1, 6]
6. Node 5: Neighbors [13, 2, 1, 0, 14]
7. Node 6: Neighbors [4, 8, 2, 0, 14]
8. Node 7: Neighbors [4, 0, 13]
9. Node 8: Neighbors [3, 10, 13, 2, 6]
10. Node 9: Neighbors [4, 3]
11. Node 10: Neighbors [11, 8]
12. Node 11: Neighbors [1, 10, 12, 2]
13. Node 12: Neighbors [3, 11, 0]
14. Node 13: Neighbors [5, 7, 8, 14]
15. Node 14: Neighbors [13, 2, 6, 5]

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
2. Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
3. Node 2: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $ 3-stars
4. Node 3: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
5. Node 4: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
6. Node 5: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
7. Node 6: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
8. Node 8: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars
9. Node 11: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
10. Node 13: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
11. Node 14: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 84 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [84]. 

Some of the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)> 
<1, (4, 5, 11)> 
<2, (5, 6, 14)> 
<3, (8, 11, 12)> 
<4, (1, 6, 7)> 
<5, (0, 1, 14)> 
<6, (0, 2, 14)> 
<8, (2, 6, 13)> 
<11, (1, 10, 12)> 
<13, (7, 8, 14)>
