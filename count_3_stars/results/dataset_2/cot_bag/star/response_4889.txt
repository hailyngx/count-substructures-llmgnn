Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 4, 1, 14, 8, 19, and 3.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 19, 1, 15, and 2.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 11, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 19, and 1. 
- Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 17, 5, and 15.
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19:
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 9, and 18.
- Number of 3-stars with node 19 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 13, and 12.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (19, 1, 15)>
<1, (4, 14, 11)>
<14, (0, 19, 1)>
<8, (1, 17, 5)>
<19, (4, 14, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 13)>
