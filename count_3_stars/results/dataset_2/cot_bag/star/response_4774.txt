Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Let's organize the nodes and their neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors - 5, 6, 2, 3, 1 (degree: 5)
2. Node 1: Neighbors - 0, 2, 9 (degree: 3)
3. Node 2: Neighbors - 4, 6, 0, 1 (degree: 4)
4. Node 3: Neighbors - 7, 8, 0 (degree: 3)
5. Node 4: Neighbors - 7, 8, 9, 6, 2 (degree: 5)
6. Node 5: Neighbors - 7, 8, 6, 0 (degree: 4)
7. Node 6: Neighbors - 4, 5, 2, 0 (degree: 4)
8. Node 7: Neighbors - 4, 3, 9, 5 (degree: 4)
9. Node 8: Neighbors - 4, 5, 9, 3 (degree: 4)
10. Node 9: Neighbors - 4, 7, 8, 1 (degree: 4)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 4 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4, 3 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9, 1 3-star: [1] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
