Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 17) (9, 15) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 1
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 3

From the degrees, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 17)>
- <4, (12, 5, 15)>
- <5, (7, 4, 19)>
- <7, (12, 5, 14)>
- <8, (13, 17, 19)>
- <10, (2, 1, 9)>
- <12, (7, 4, 11)>
- <13, (8, 1, 6)>
- <17, (8, 12, 15)>
- <19, (8, 5, 17)>
