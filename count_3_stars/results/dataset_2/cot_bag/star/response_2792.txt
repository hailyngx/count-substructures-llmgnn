Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 18) (8, 7) (8, 18) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (15, 17) (19, 4) (19, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 17) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 2) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 17) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 25 unique 3-stars:

\[ [25] \] 

And the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 11)>
- <0, (2, 6, 11)>
- <0, (2, 7, 11)>
- <0, (2, 17, 11)>
- <2, (0, 6, 11)>
- <2, (0, 7, 11)>
- <2, (0, 17, 11)>
- <4, (3, 5, 17)>
- <4, (5, 13, 18)>
- <4, (5, 14, 17)>
- <4, (5, 16, 17)>
- <5, (13, 14, 18)>
- <5, (13, 16, 17)>
- <5, (14, 16, 17)>
- <6, (0, 11, 19)>
- <7, (1, 8, 12)>
- <7, (2, 8, 18)>
- <7, (3, 8, 13)>
- <7, (3, 12, 13)>
- <9, (2, 10, 11)>
- <9, (2, 11, 18)>
- <9, (10, 11, 18)>
- <13, (3, 5, 18)>
- <13, (3, 18, 19)>
- <13, (5, 18, 19)>
