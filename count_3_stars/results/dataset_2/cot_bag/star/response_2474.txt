Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 17) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 19) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: Neighbors are 11, 15, 7, and 2 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: Neighbors are 16, 9, 18, and 17 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: Neighbors are 9, 10, 19, and 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: Neighbors are 6, 5, 14, and 10 (4 neighbors)
- Node 16: Neighbors are 7, 12, and 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 17: Neighbors are 5, 10, 0, and 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 18: Neighbors are 5, 2, 19, and 0 (4 neighbors)
- Node 19: Neighbors are 6, 2, 18, and 13 (4 neighbors)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For each node with four neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at that node.
So, for nodes 3, 5, 6, 9, 17, 18, and 19, we have \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) 3-stars.

For node 16, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed. 
Hence, node 16 contributes 1 3-star.

Combining all the 3-stars formed at the nodes with four neighbors and node 16, we have a total of 29 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (11, 15, 7)>
- <3, (15, 1, 12)>
- <3, (7, 16, 5)>
- <5, (16, 9, 18)>
- <5, (9, 6, 10)>
- <5, (10, 17, 7)>
- <6, (9, 10, 19)>
- <6, (10, 17, 0)>
- <9, (6, 5, 14)>
- <9, (5, 17, 0)>
- <17, (5, 10, 0)>
- <18, (5, 2, 19)>
- <18, (2, 19, 0)>
- <19, (6, 2, 18)>
