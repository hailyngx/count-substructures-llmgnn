Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (15, 18) (15, 1) (9, 11) (9, 17) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (2, 11) (2, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and denote them as potential center nodes for the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors: 14, 10, 3, 19
- Node 1 with neighbors: 16, 6, 15
- Node 3 with neighbors: 8, 0, 13, 12
- Node 4 with neighbors: 18, 13, 17
- Node 5 with neighbors: 6, 7, 14
- Node 6 with neighbors: 5, 1, 10
- Node 8 with neighbors: 11, 16, 3
- Node 9 with neighbors: 11, 17
- Node 10 with neighbors: 6, 0, 14, 12, 7
- Node 11 with neighbors: 9, 8, 2
- Node 12 with neighbors: 17, 10, 3
- Node 13 with neighbors: 16, 4, 17, 3
- Node 14 with neighbors: 5, 0, 10
- Node 15 with neighbors: 18, 1
- Node 16 with neighbors: 1, 13, 8
- Node 17 with neighbors: 4, 9, 13, 2, 12

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the above information:

- Node 0: [\binom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [1] = 1
- Node 3: [\binom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 10: [\binom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [1] = 1
- Node 12: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [\binom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [\binom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17: [\binom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by the potential center nodes, we get:
4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 40

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (14, 3, 19)>
<0, (14, 10, 3)>
<0, (14, 10, 19)>
<0, (14, 3, 10)>
<1, (16, 6, 15)>
<3, (8, 0, 13)>
<4, (18, 13, 17)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<10, (6, 14, 12)>
<10, (6, 14, 7)>
<10, (6, 12, 7)>
<10, (14, 12, 7)>
<13, (16, 4, 17)>
<17, (9, 13, 2)>
<17, (9, 13, 12)>
<17, (9, 13, 17)>
<17, (9, 2, 12)>
<17, (9, 2, 17)>
<17, (9, 12, 17)>
<17, (13, 2, 12)>
