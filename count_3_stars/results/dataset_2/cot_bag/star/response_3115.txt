Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 10
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 12
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 12
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 7, 11, 14
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 13
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 10, 12
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8, 10
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 13
- Node 10 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 11
- Node 11 has neighbors: 4, 9, 10, 13, 14
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 14
- Node 14 has neighbors: 4, 11, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 6):
  - Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

- For nodes with 5 neighbors (7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14):
  - Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Total number of 3-stars: 5 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) + 5 (from nodes with 5 neighbors) = 10
- The unique 3-stars found: 
  - <0, 1, 5>
  - <0, 1, 6>
  - <0, 1, 12>
  - <0, 5, 6>
  - <1, 12, 6>
  - <7, 2, 8>
  - <7, 2, 10>
  - <7, 3, 4>
  - <7, 3, 5>
  - <7, 10, 11>
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
