Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 22) (25, 14) (25, 20) (25, 4) (25, 18) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 28) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (26, 29) (26, 0) (13, 17) (11, 28) (11, 27) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 15) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 25) (4, 27) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 24) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 10) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (24, 27) (24, 18) (24, 15) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 0) (23, 10) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 23) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 15) (15, 21) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 24) (15, 22) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \) ways to choose 3 nodes out of 30 nodes. Now, let's identify the central nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors

By applying the formula, we get the total number of 3-stars as: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 29 \]

Therefore, putting the final number inside brackets gives us: \[ [29] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (21, 15, 22)>
<2, (5, 6, 28)>
<2, (5, 6, 15)>
<4, (17, 25, 27)>
<21, (1, 3, 22)>
<21, (1, 21, 15)>
<21, (1, 21, 22)>
<21, (3, 15, 22)>
<21, (21, 15, 22)>
<17, (4, 20, 25)>
<17, (4, 20, 27)>
<17, (4, 25, 27)>
<20, (4, 22, 25)>
<20, (4, 22, 20)>
<20, (4, 22, 15)>
<20, (4, 25, 22)>
<25, (4, 20, 22)>
<25, (4, 20, 18)>
<25, (4, 20, 25)>
<25, (18, 20, 4)>
<5, (2, 6, 28)>
<6, (2, 5, 15)>
<14, (3, 25, 14)>
<28, (6, 15, 28)>
<27, (4, 25, 27)>
<3, (1, 21, 3)>
