This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 7) (27, 26) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 21) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 29) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (20, 13) (25, 9) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 12) (26, 27) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 10) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 24) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 16) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 22) (12, 19) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 3) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 10) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 24) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 7) (11, 5) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (7, 27) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 24) (29, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 2, 6, 13, 14, 17, 21, 22, 24, and 28.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with them:

1. Node 2: It has 5 neighbors (8, 15, 5, 19, 16), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
2. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors (25, 28, 21, 24), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
3. Node 13: It has 4 neighbors (14, 8, 26, 20), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
4. Node 14: It has 3 neighbors (1, 9, 13), so there is 1 3-star.  
5. Node 17: It has 3 neighbors (28, 22, 21), so there is 1 3-star.  
6. Node 21: It has 4 neighbors (27, 17, 6, 16), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
7. Node 22: It has 4 neighbors (17, 28, 26, 12), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
8. Node 24: It has 4 neighbors (6, 4, 0, 10), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
9. Node 28: It has 4 neighbors (17, 6, 10, 22), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 32, which we can write as [32].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
