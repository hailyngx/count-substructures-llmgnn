Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
To start constructing the graph, we'll list the nodes that each node is connected to:

- Node 0: 1, 19
- Node 1: 0, 9, 12
- Node 2: 7, 8, 16
- Node 3: 5, 10, 12, 14
- Node 4: 5, 10, 16
- Node 5: 3, 4, 14, 17
- Node 6: 8, 12, 18
- Node 7: 2, 13, 18
- Node 8: 2, 6, 10
- Node 9: 1, 13
- Node 10: 3, 4, 8
- Node 11: 13
- Node 12: 1, 3, 6, 15
- Node 13: 7, 9, 11
- Node 14: 3, 5, 15, 19
- Node 15: 12, 14, 16
- Node 16: 2, 4, 15, 19
- Node 17: 5, 19
- Node 18: 6, 7
- Node 19: 0, 14, 16, 17

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1] 3-star
- Node 1: [1] 3-star
- Node 2: [1] 3-star
- Node 3: [3] 3-stars <3, (5, 10, 12)>, <14, (4, 5, 15)>, <14, (5, 15, 19)>
- Node 4: [1] 3-star
- Node 5: [1] 3-star
- Node 6: [1] 3-star
- Node 7: [1] 3-star
- Node 8: [1] 3-star
- Node 9: [0] 3-stars
- Node 10: [1] 3-star
- Node 11: [0] 3-stars
- Node 12: [1] 3-star
- Node 13: [0] 3-stars
- Node 14: [1] 3-star
- Node 15: [1] 3-star
- Node 16: [1] 3-star
- Node 17: [0] 3-stars
- Node 18: [0] 3-stars
- Node 19: [1] 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, there are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<3, (5, 10, 12)>, <14, (4, 5, 15)>, <14, (5, 15, 19)>, <0, (1, 19, 14)>, <1, (9, 12, 0)>, <2, (7, 8, 16)>, <3, (5, 14, 4)>, <4, (5, 16, 10)>, <5, (3, 17, 14)>, <6, (12, 18, 8)>, <7, (13, 18, 2)>, <8, (6, 10, 2)>, <12, (15, 3, 1)>, <19, (14, 16, 17)>
