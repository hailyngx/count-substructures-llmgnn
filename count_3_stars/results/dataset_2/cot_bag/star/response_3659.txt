Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 13) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 5) (16, 18) (0, 10) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (11, 5) (11, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's identify them and count the 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (15, 9, 2), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors (3, 1, 8, 4), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <15, (3, 1, 8)>, <15, (3, 1, 4)>, <15, (3, 8, 4)>, <15, (1, 8, 4)>.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors (17, 19, 2), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (14, 10, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (17, 5, 7, 10), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <6, (17, 5, 7)>, <6, (17, 5, 10)>, <6, (17, 7, 10)>, <6, (5, 7, 10)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 18), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (17, 6, 0, 12), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <10, (17, 6, 0)>, <10, (17, 6, 12)>, <10, (17, 0, 12)>, <10, (6, 0, 12)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (15, 8, 1, 2), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <4, (15, 8, 1)>, <4, (15, 8, 2)>, <4, (15, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (15, 9, 4, 18), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <8, (15, 9, 4)>, <8, (15, 9, 18)>, <8, (15, 4, 18)>, <8, (9, 4, 18)>.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (6, 12, 11, 16, 7), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <5, (6, 12, 11)>, <5, (6, 12, 16)>, <5, (6, 12, 7)>, <5, (6, 11, 16)>, <5, (6, 11, 7)>, <5, (6, 16, 7)>, <5, (12, 11, 16)>, <5, (12, 11, 7)>, <5, (12, 16, 7)>, <5, (11, 16, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 14, 4, 13), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <2, (3, 14, 4)>, <2, (3, 14, 13)>, <2, (3, 4, 13)>, <2, (14, 4, 13)>.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (15, 4, 11), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (2, 18, 2), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (6, 5), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors (5, 18), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor (10), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (9, 8, 13, 16), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The formed 3-stars are: <18, (9, 8, 13)>, <18, (9, 8, 16)>, <18, (9, 13, 16)>, <18, (8, 13, 16)>.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors (5, 1), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors (10, 5), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor (14), so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: $$[1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0] = [35]$$

So, the unique 3-stars are: <3, (15, 9, 2)>, <15, (3, 1, 8)>, <15, (3, 1, 4)>, <15, (3, 8, 4)>, <15, (1, 8, 4)>, <14, (17, 19, 2)>, <17, (14, 10, 6)>, <6, (17, 5, 7)>, <6, (17, 5, 10)>, <6, (17, 7, 10)>, <6, (5, 7, 10)>, <9, (3, 8, 18)>, <10, (17, 6, 0)>, <10, (17, 6, 12)>, <10, (17, 0, 12)>, <10, (6, 0, 12)>, <4, (15, 8, 1)>, <4, (15, 8, 2)>, <4, (15, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <8, (15, 9, 4)>, <8, (15, 9, 18)>, <8, (15, 4, 18)>, <8, (9, 4, 18)>, <5, (6, 12, 11)>, <5, (6, 12, 16)>, <5, (6, 12, 7)>, <5, (6, 11, 16)>, <5, (6, 11, 7)>, <5, (6, 16, 7)>, <5, (12, 11, 16)>, <5, (12, 11, 7)>, <5, (12, 16, 7)>, <5, (11, 16, 7)>, <2, (3, 14, 4)>, <2, (3, 14, 13)>, <2, (3, 4, 13)>, <2, (14, 4, 13)>, <1, (15, 4, 11)>, <13, (2, 18, 13)>, <18, (9, 8, 13)>, <18, (9, 8, 16)>, <18, (9, 13, 16)>, <18, (8, 13, 16)>.
