Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9 have 5 neighbors.  
For each of these nodes, there exist \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

Therefore, [40] unique 3-stars are formed in this graph:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
