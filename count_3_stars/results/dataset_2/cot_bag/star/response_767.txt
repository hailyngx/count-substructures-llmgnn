- Node 2: {19, 27}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 22, 17}
- Node 4: {14, 3}
- Node 5: {21}
- Node 6: {13, 0, 12}
- Node 7: {25, 3, 24}
- Node 8: {14, 16, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {27, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 19}
- Node 11: {13, 20}
- Node 12: {8, 6, 20}
- Node 13: {18, 11, 29, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 8, 18}
- Node 15: {25, 16, 23}
- Node 16: {21, 8, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {28, 3, 23, 27}
- Node 18: {23, 14, 28, 13}
- Node 19: {10, 24, 22, 2}
- Node 20: {26, 21, 11, 23, 12}
- Node 21: {5, 20, 16}
- Node 22: {19, 3}
- Node 23: {18, 15, 17, 20}
- Node 24: {28, 7, 19}
- Node 25: {7, 15}
- Node 26: {20}
- Node 27: {9, 17, 2, 29}
- Node 28: {9, 18, 17, 24}
- Node 29: {13, 16, 27}
  
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (8, 10, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (13, 0, 12)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (14, 16, 0)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (18, 11, 29)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (21, 8, 15)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (28, 3, 23)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (23, 14, 28)>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (10, 24, 22)>
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star: <20, (26, 21, 11)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star: <21, (5, 20, 16)>
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star: <23, (18, 15, 17)>
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, (9, 17, 2)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star: <28, (9, 18, 17)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
