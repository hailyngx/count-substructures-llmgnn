Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will analyze each of them to find the number of 3-stars formed.

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 15, 2, 12, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (15, 2, 12)>, <3, (15, 2, 8)>, <3, (15, 12, 8)>, <3, (2, 12, 8)>

For node 15:
- Neighbors: 3, 1, 16
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <15, (3, 1, 16)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 7, 12, 19, 2
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (7, 12, 19)>, <5, (7, 12, 2)>, <5, (7, 19, 2)>, <5, (12, 19, 2)>

For node 19:
- Neighbors: 0, 5, 4, 13
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <19, (0, 5, 4)>, <19, (0, 5, 13)>, <19, (0, 4, 13)>, <19, (5, 4, 13)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 15, 16, 9, 18
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (15, 16, 9)>, <1, (15, 16, 18)>, <1, (15, 9, 18)>, <1, (16, 9, 18)>

For node 13:
- Neighbors: 0, 14, 19, 9, 18
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <13, (0, 14, 19)>, <13, (0, 14, 9)>, <13, (0, 14, 18)>, <13, (0, 19, 9)>, <13, (0, 19, 18)>, <13, (0, 9, 18)>, <13, (14, 19, 9)>, <13, (14, 19, 18)>, <13, (14, 9, 18)>, <13, (19, 9, 18)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
