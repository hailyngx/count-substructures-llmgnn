Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 5
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 2
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 2
- Node 25 has degree 2
- Node 26 has degree 3
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 5

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{21}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{29}{3}] \]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[ [0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 84 + 165 + 220 + 364 + 455 + 455 + 560 + 1330 + 2024 + 2600 + 2925 + 3280 + 4060] \]
\[ = 14536 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14536.

Now, let's list a few unique 3-stars:
<0, 9, 26>
<1, 4, 11>
<2, 15, 27>
<3, 0, 29>
<6, 9, 26>
<7, 12, 15>
<8, 13, 14>
... (and so on, 14536 in total)
