Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 84 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 84. 

Within <>: <1, 3, 11>, <5, 8, 14>, <9, 1, 13>
So, the final answer is [84].
