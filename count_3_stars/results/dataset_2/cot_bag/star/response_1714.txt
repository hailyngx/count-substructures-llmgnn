Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{0} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 10, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 11, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 14, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 85 3-stars in the graph:

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 85\]

Therefore, the final answer is [85]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 13, 14)>, <4, (7, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 13, 14)>, <7, (3, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 10, 11)>, <10, (3, 7, 14)>, <11, (1, 4, 8)>, <13, (0, 2, 6)>, <14, (0, 3, 7)>.
