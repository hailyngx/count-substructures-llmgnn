Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 4) (5, 12) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 0) (14, 19) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (17, 19, 4), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (18, 16, 7), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (13, 2, 16, 11), contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (8, 19, 7), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (17, 18, 1), contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (6, 10, 12, 11), contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (6, 18, 5, 16), contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (9, 10, 4, 11), contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (17, 2, 5, 3), contributing 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (12, 19), so no 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors (6, 13, 3, 15, 14), contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors (9, 8, 4, 15, 1), contributing 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (8, 17, 18, 0), contributing 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
