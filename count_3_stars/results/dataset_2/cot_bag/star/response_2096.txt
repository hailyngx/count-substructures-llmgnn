Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

We will find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star 
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 16: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 19: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of 26 3-stars, which we represent as [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 13)>, <0, (4, 9, 19)>, <0, (8, 13, 19)>, <0, (9, 13, 19)>, <2, (4, 9, 18)>, <3, (4, 17, 19)>, <4, (0, 8, 19)>, <6, (8, 16, 1)>, <8, (0, 6, 13)>, <9, (4, 8, 19)>, <10, (5, 11, 7)>, <11, (10, 15, 8)>, <13, (0, 8, 19)>, <15, (10, 11, 17)>, <16, (6, 7, 18)>, <17, (3, 15, 9)>, <18, (2, 4, 15)>, <19, (0, 4, 9)>.

So, the final answer is [26].
