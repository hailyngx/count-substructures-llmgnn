Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 78 \).

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
