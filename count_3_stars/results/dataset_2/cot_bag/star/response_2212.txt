Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0:                   \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1:                   \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3:                   \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4:                   \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5:                   \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6:                   \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7:                   \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8:                   \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9:                   \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 61

So, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
