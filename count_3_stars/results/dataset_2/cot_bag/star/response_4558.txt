Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node with three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 0 as the center. <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 1)>, <0, (6, 5, 1)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 1 as the center. <1, (4, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (6, 2, 0)>, <1, (2, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>, <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 2 as the center. <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 9, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with 3 as the center. <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with 4 as the center. <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 1)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (6, 1, 0)>, <4, (6, 1, 5)>, <4, (6, 0, 7)>, <4, (6, 0, 1)>, <4, (6, 0, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>, <4, (1, 5, 0)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 0, 7)>, <4, (1, 0, 6)>, <4, (1, 0, 5)>, <4, (5, 0, 6)>, <4, (5, 0, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 9, 8)>, <4, (7, 2, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <4, (2, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (2, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <4, (0, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 5 as the center. <5, (4, 6, 2)>, <5, (4, 1, 6)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 0, 2)>, <5, (6, 0, 1)>, <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 6, 0)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 6 as the center. <6, (4, 5, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 0, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 1)>, <6, (4, 5, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 1, 8)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so there's no 3-star with 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with 8 as the center. <8, (9, 3, 1)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with 9 as the center. <9, (4, 0, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 3)>, <9, (0, 8, 3)>, <9, (8, 3, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 81. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [81].
