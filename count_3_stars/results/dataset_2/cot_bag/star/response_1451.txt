Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 5: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 9: 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 11: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 13: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 14: 3 choose 3 = 1

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 96 3-stars in total.

So the final answer is [96].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<3, (8, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 10)>
<8, (3, 6, 10)>
<9, (4, 7, 11)>
<10, (2, 5, 6)>
<11, (1, 9, 13)>
<13, (0, 1, 14)>
<14, (1, 13, 3)>
