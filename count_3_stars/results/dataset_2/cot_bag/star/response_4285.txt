Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 6, 9, 2, 11, 5, 12, 14, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in the given graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 11, 13)>, <7, (4, 1, 6)>, <1, (7, 5, 9)>, <8, (7, 0, 13)>, <13, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 10)>, <9, (1, 6, 13)>, <0, (3, 8, 12)>
