Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these results: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
