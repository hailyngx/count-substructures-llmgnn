Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 16) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 19) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 19
- Node 1: 2, 10, 16
- Node 2: 1, 15, 16
- Node 3: 7, 8, 18, 19
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 12, 14
- Node 6: 8, 12, 13
- Node 7: 3, 11, 19
- Node 8: 3, 6, 10
- Node 9: 4, 16
- Node 10: 1, 8, 18
- Node 11: 7, 13, 14, 17, 18
- Node 12: 5, 6, 14
- Node 13: 6, 11
- Node 14: 5, 11, 12
- Node 15: 2, 16
- Node 16: 1, 2, 9, 15
- Node 17: 11, 18, 19
- Node 18: 3, 10, 11, 17
- Node 19: 0, 3, 7, 17

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 11, 18, and 19.

- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

The unique 3-stars are: <3, (7, 18, 19)>, <11, (7, 13, 17)>, <11, (7, 14, 18)>, <11, (13, 14, 18)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].
