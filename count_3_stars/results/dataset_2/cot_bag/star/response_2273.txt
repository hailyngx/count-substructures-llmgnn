Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 19) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (23, 12) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 21) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 2) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 11) (24, 26) (24, 18) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 25) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 17) (17, 20) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 4) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 14) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 18) (28, 5) (28, 9) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 29) (4, 2) (4, 9) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (19, 3) (18, 24) (18, 16) (18, 14) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 14) (12, 13) (12, 23) (12, 15) (22, 27) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 9) (25, 11) (25, 10) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be visualized as follows: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
{(0, 27), (0, 5), (0, 2), (27, 0), (27, 22), (27, 3), (27, 19), (8, 13), (8, 11), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 10), (23, 12), (23, 19), (15, 20), (15, 19), (15, 12), (20, 15), (20, 17), (20, 26), (20, 21), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 28), (6, 2), (26, 20), (26, 24), (26, 11), (24, 26), (24, 18), (3, 27), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 19), (11, 8), (11, 26), (11, 3), (11, 25), (21, 20), (21, 29), (21, 17), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 1), (17, 4), (1, 17), (1, 29), (1, 14), (7, 3), (7, 16), (7, 9), (16, 7), (16, 18), (28, 5), (28, 9), (29, 21), (29, 1), (29, 4), (29, 10), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 4), (4, 17), (4, 29), (4, 2), (4, 9), (19, 27), (19, 23), (19, 15), (19, 3), (18, 24), (18, 16), (18, 14), (9, 7), (9, 28), (9, 4), (9, 14), (12, 13), (12, 23), (12, 15), (22, 27), (14, 1), (14, 18), (14, 9), (25, 11), (25, 10), (10, 13), (10, 29), (10, 25)}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

\[ inom{30}{3} \] = 4060

Each node with at least 3 neighbors can form a 3-star. Let's count the number of such nodes:

Node 0: <0, (27, 5, 2)>
Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
Node 3: <3, (27, 11, 19)>
Node 4: <4, (17, 29, 2)>
Node 9: <9, (7, 28, 4)>
Node 10: <10, (13, 29, 25)>
Node 11: <11, (8, 26, 3)>
Node 12: <12, (13, 23, 15)>
Node 13: <13, (8, 12, 10)>
Node 14: <14, (1, 18, 9)>
Node 15: <15, (20, 19, 12)>
Node 16: <16, (7, 18, 14)>
Node 17: <17, (20, 21, 4)>
Node 19: <19, (27, 23, 15)>
Node 20: <20, (15, 17, 26)>
Node 21: <21, (20, 29, 17)>
Node 26: <26, (20, 24, 11)>
Node 27: <27, (0, 22, 3)>
Node 29: <29, (21, 1, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: [18]
