Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 16) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 20) (17, 15) (17, 4) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 22) (3, 4) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 16) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 22) (0, 25) (0, 23) (2, 23) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 2) (26, 28) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 8) (20, 17) (20, 24) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (19, 21) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 5) (8, 27) (8, 15) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 25) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 16) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 23) (25, 10) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph: node 5, node 9, node 10, node 1, node 3, node 7, node 21, node 12, node 6, and node 28. Let's see how many 3-stars can be formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 21: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 1 3-star

Adding these up, we find a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, 13, 1>
- <9, 4, 17>
- <10, 5, 8>
- <1, 14, 18>
- <3, 1, 13>
- <12, 7, 21>
- <6, 28, 22>
