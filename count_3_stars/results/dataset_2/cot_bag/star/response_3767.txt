Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: = [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1: = [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: = [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: = [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: = [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: = [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: = [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 75

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
