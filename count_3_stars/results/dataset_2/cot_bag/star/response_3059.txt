Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: has 3 neighbors (17, 14, 10)
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors (3, 16, 0, 11)
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (15, 2, 8)
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors (15, 13, 16)
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors (19, 11, 10)
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors (19, 14, 8)
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors (3, 9, 7, 12)
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors (15, 6, 8)
- Node 10: has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 13)
- Node 11: has 3 neighbors (5, 2, 13)
- Node 13: has 5 neighbors (4, 18, 19, 10, 11)
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors (1, 7, 18, 12)
- Node 15: has 4 neighbors (3, 9, 17, 4)
- Node 16: has 2 neighbors (4, 2)
- Node 19: has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 5, 13)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, 17, 14, 10>
- <2, 3, 16, 0>
- <2, 3, 11, 13>
- <2, 3, 16, 4>
- <2, 0, 16, 4>
- <3, 15, 2, 8>
- <4, 15, 16, 13>
- <5, 19, 13, 10>
- <7, 8, 14, 12>
- <9, 15, 6, 8>
- <13, 4, 11, 18>
- <13, 5, 11, 19>
- <13, 10, 11, 5>
- <13, 10, 18, 11>
- <14, 1, 7, 18>
- <14, 1, 12, 7>
- <15, 3, 9, 4>
- <19, 5, 13, 11>
- <19, 5, 13, 10>
- <19, 6, 9, 15>
