Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes that have more than 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 5: 0

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 6: 1

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 9: 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for each node: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>
