Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<0, (6, 5, 1)>
<7, (8, 5, 9)>
<1, (8, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
