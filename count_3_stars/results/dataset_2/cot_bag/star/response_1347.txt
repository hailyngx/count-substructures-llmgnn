Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
edges: 
- 0: {6, 9, 1, 4, 7}
- 1: {3, 2, 5, 4, 0}
- 2: {9, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- 3: {9, 1, 7, 5}
- 4: {1, 5, 0}
- 5: {6, 1, 3, 4}
- 6: {5, 0}
- 7: {3, 0, 2, 8}
- 8: {9, 7, 2}
- 9: {8, 2, 3, 0}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star can be formed.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
