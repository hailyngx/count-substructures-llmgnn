Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 19) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 4) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: 3, 13
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 7, 13, 19
- Node 3: 0, 11, 12, 13, 19
- Node 4: 1, 12, 16, 17
- Node 5: 9, 13, 15, 17
- Node 6: 7, 12
- Node 7: 2, 6, 10, 16
- Node 8: 10, 19
- Node 9: 1, 5, 12
- Node 10: 7, 8, 14, 18
- Node 11: 3, 18
- Node 12: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 13: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 14: 10, 19
- Node 15: 5, 17
- Node 16: 4, 7, 18
- Node 17: 4, 5, 15
- Node 18: 10, 11, 16
- Node 19: 2, 3, 8, 14

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together: 
3 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (13, 19, 3)>, <3, (19, 13, 0)>, <4, (17, 12, 16)>, <5, (17, 15, 9)>, <7, (16, 10, 2)>, <9, (1, 5, 12)>, <10, (18, 14, 7)>, <12, (3, 6, 4)>, <13, (3, 5, 0)>, <16, (7, 18, 4)>, <18, (10, 16, 11)>, <19, (14, 8, 2)>
