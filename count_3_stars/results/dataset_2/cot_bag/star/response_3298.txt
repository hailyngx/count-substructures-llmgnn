Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (13, 16) (13, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
Let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the information provided.

We will first organize the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 4, 17
Node 1: 9, 7, 5
Node 2: 15, 5, 19, 11
Node 3: 7, 16, 8
Node 4: 7, 0, 10, 14
Node 5: 1, 2
Node 6: 9, 7, 11
Node 7: 3, 6, 4, 12, 1
Node 8: 3, 19, 10, 16
Node 9: 6, 17, 1
Node 10: 4, 19, 8
Node 11: 15, 6, 2, 13
Node 12: 15, 7, 14
Node 13: 16, 11
Node 14: 4, 12
Node 15: 12, 2, 11
Node 16: 3, 17, 8, 13
Node 17: 9, 16, 0
Node 19: 8, 2, 10

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 28 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
