Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 17) (13, 3) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 11) (8, 9) (8, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (13, 9, 18)>, <3, (13, 9, 3)>, <3, (13, 18, 14)>, <3, (9, 18, 14)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <14, (2, 3, 4)>, <14, (2, 3, 12)>, <14, (2, 4, 12)>, <14, (3, 4, 12)>.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <15, (10, 17, 18)>, <15, (10, 17, 15)>, <15, (10, 17, 11)>, <15, (17, 18, 11)>.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <16, (17, 19, 4)>, <16, (17, 19, 16)>, <16, (17, 4, 16)>, <16, (19, 4, 16)>.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
