Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up these 3-star counts, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, there are 74 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (7, 5, 9)>, \\
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, \\
<2, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <13, (2, 4, 6)>, <13, (2, 4, 14)>, \\
<13, (2, 6, 14)>, <13, (4, 6, 14)>
\]

The total number of 3-stars is 74.
