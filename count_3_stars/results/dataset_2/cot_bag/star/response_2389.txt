Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 2, 11 => 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 10, 18, 11, 0 => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 5 => 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 13 => 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 8, 16, 13, 19 => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 2, 16, 14 => 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 17, 2, 18, 0, 12 => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 10, 19, 12 => 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 2, 11, 7 => 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 17, 4, 14, 9, 7 => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
