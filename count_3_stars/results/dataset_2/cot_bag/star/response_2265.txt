Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 3) (9, 7) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 11) (27, 3) (27, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 28) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 28) (1, 26) (1, 19) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 21) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 21) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 15) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 24) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 18) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 11) (11, 27) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 18) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 15) (3, 9) (3, 27) (25, 9) (25, 24) (29, 16) (24, 10) (24, 25) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 12) (12, 5) (12, 20) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 29) (4, 0) (4, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 0, 27, 13, 26, 14, 21, 28, 19, 6, 10, 22, 11, 18, 20, 12, 15, 16, 4.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, the total number is [25].
