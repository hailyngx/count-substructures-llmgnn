Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 5, 9, 8, 4  
2: 9, 6, 8, 4, 0   
3: 5, 6, 0  
4: 5, 9, 2, 0, 1  
5: 9, 1, 4, 3  
6: 7, 3, 2  
7: 6, 8, 0  
8: 9, 2, 7, 1  
9: 5, 9, 8, 4, 2  

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4  
<1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (9, 8, 4)>  

Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10  
<2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 4)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>, <2, (8, 4, 0)>  

Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10  
<4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (2, 0, 1)>  

Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4  
<8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (9, 2, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (2, 7, 1)>  

Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10  
<9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>  

Adding these up, we have a total of [38] unique 3-stars:  
<1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (2, 0, 1)>, <8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (9, 2, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (2, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8...
