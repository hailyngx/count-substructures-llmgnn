Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

1: 11, 2, 10, 4  
2: 5, 7, 3, 14, 1, 6  
3: 12, 11, 10, 4, 2  
4: 5, 3, 1, 10, 0  
5: 9, 13, 2, 4  
6: 12, 13, 2  
7: 11, 14, 2  
8: 9  
9: 5, 8, 13, 12  
10: 12, 3, 1, 4  
11: 7, 13, 3, 14, 1, 0  
12: 9, 10, 14, 6, 3  
13: 5, 9, 11, 6  
14: 7, 12, 11, 2  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 2 3-stars.
Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 2 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 2 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 13, 12)>
<2, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (12, 11, 4)>
<11, (7, 13, 14)>
<12, (9, 10, 6)>
<4, (5, 3, 1)>
