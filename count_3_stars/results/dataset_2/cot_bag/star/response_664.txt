Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 2) (9, 26) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 18) (15, 2) (15, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 17) (23, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 22) (29, 21) (24, 10) (24, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (25, 0) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 3) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 28) (12, 4) (12, 13) (21, 16) (21, 29) (19, 18) (19, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (5, 20) (5, 28) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 6) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 14) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 20), (0, 25), (0, 6)  
Node 2: (2, 15), (2, 17), (2, 16), (2, 10)  
Node 6: (6, 27), (6, 0), (6, 29), (6, 14)  
Node 8: (8, 23), (8, 14), (8, 17)  
Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 2), (10, 24)  
Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 28), (12, 4), (12, 13)  
Node 14: (14, 8), (14, 28), (14, 6)  
Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 21), (16, 18), (16, 2)  
Node 18: (18, 16), (18, 26), (18, 19), (18, 1), (18, 3)  
Node 20: (20, 11), (20, 0), (20, 13), (20, 22), (20, 5)  
Node 22: (22, 27), (22, 20), (22, 29), (22, 3)  
Node 26: (26, 9), (26, 18)  
Node 28: (28, 12), (28, 14), (28, 5)  
Node 29: (29, 17), (29, 1), (29, 6), (29, 22), (29, 21)  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up to find the total.  

Number of 3-stars for each node:  
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 26: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 \)  
\( = 63 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].  

And the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (9, 10, 20)>  
<0, (9, 10, 25)>  
<0, (9, 10, 6)>  
<0, (10, 20, 25)>  
<0, (10, 20, 6)>  
<0, (10, 25, 6)>  
<2, (15, 17, 16)>  
<6, (27, 29, 22)>  
<12, (3, 28, 4)>  
<16, (11, 21, 18)>  
<18, (16, 26, 19)>  
<18, (16, 26, 1)>  
<18, (16, 26, 3)>  
<18, (26, 19, 1)>  
<18, (26, 19, 3)>  
<18, (19, 1, 3)>  
<20, (11, 13, 22)>  
<20, (11, 13, 5)>  
<20, (13, 22, 5)>  
<22, (27, 29, 3)>  
<29, (17, 1, 7)>  
<29, (17, 1, 21)>  
<29, (17, 7, 21)>
