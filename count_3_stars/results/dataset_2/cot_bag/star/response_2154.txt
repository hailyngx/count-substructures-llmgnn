Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 12. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 5, 12, and 11.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 1: <1, (7, 5, 11)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 14, and 11.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 2: <2, (5, 9, 11)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 11, and 9.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 3: <3, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 10, 5, and 6.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 4: <4, (10, 5, 6)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 2, 1, and 10.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 5: <5, (4, 2, 10)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 14, 12, and 0.
- There are two 3-stars formed with node 6: <6, (4, 13, 12)> and <6, (13, 14, 12)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 7, 8, 2, 3, 11, and 10.
- There are two 3-stars formed with node 9: <9, (7, 8, 10)> and <9, (2, 11, 10)>.

For node 11:
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors: 2, 12, 3, 1, 0, and 9.
- There are two 3-stars formed with node 11: <11, (2, 12, 9)> and <11, (3, 1, 9)>.

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 8, 6, 14, 11, and 1.
- There is only one 3-star formed with node 12: <12, (8, 6, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (7, 5, 11)>, <2, (5, 9, 11)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (10, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 2, 10)>, <6, (4, 13, 12)>, <6, (13, 14, 12)>, <9, (7, 8, 10)>, <9, (2, 11, 10)>, and <11, (2, 12, 9)>.
