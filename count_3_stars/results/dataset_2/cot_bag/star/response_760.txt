Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) [There are only 2 neighbors]

For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars gives: 1+20+20+10+10+4+4+10 = 79.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 8, 10)>, <2, (0, 12, 10)>, <3, (4, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 1, 13)>, <5, (9, 8, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 12)>, <10, (0, 3, 13)>, <12, (9, 14, 2)>, <13, (5, 6, 4)>.
