Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first organize the edges based on the nodes they are incident to:

Node 0: (4, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0)
Node 1: (5, 1), (6, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1)
Node 2: (5, 2), (7, 2), (3, 2)
Node 3: (5, 3), (9, 3), (4, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)
Node 4: (7, 4), (8, 4), (0, 4), (6, 4), (3, 4)
Node 5: (9, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5)
Node 6: (9, 6), (4, 6), (1, 6), (8, 6)
Node 7: (9, 7), (4, 7), (2, 7)
Node 8: (9, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (0, 8)
Node 9: (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9)

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
Node 9 forms 3 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (5, 3, 6)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us [1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10].
