Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 2) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 2) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (8, 16) (8, 3) (6, 15) 

Response:
There are some nodes with only two neighbors, and thus do not form 3-stars. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:

Nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 11

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 16
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 0
- Node 7
- Node 3
- Node 1
- Node 15
- Node 17
- Node 2
- Node 10
- Node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 46

Hence, there are a total of [46] 3-stars. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <11, (3, 18, 15)>
- <16, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (13, 1, 17)>
- <9, (16, 10, 19)>
- <0, (5, 7, 1)>
- <3, (11, 9, 17)>
- <15, (11, 1, 6)>
- <17, (5, 7, 3)>
- <2, (13, 15, 19)>
- <10, (7, 3, 9)>
