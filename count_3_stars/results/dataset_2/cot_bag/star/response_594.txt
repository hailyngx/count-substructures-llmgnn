Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 13) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges:
- Node 0: (0, 13), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 14), (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 13), (2, 6), (2, 12), (2, 1)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 14)
- Node 4: (4, 12), (4, 5), (4, 14)
- Node 5: (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14)
- Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 10), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 14), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 5), (8, 12), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 13), (9, 7), (9, 1)
- Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 7)
- Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 1), (11, 13), (11, 8)
- Node 12: (12, 8), (12, 4), (12, 2), (12, 14), (12, 1)
- Node 13: (13, 11), (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 9), (13, 0)
- Node 14: (14, 4), (14, 5), (14, 12), (14, 3), (14, 7), (14, 1)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 also has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
No other nodes have degree 3 or more, so we only have 30 total 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 14, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 14)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 14)>
<1, (0, 9, 14)>
<1, (2, 0, 14)>
<1, (2, 0, 9)>
<1, (9, 14, 2)>
<1, (9, 14, 0)>
<1, (9, 0, 14)>
<2, (0, 13, 6)>
<2, (6, 13, 0)>
<2, (13, 0, 6)>
<8, (5, 7, 14)>
<8, (5, 4, 12)>
<8, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (7, 10, 5)>
<8, (10, 7, 5)>
<8, (10, 7, 14)>
<8, (7, 5, 10)>
<8, (7, 14, 10)>
<8, (5, 10, 7)>
<8, (12, 4, 14)>
<8, (4, 14, 12)>

<8, (14, 12, 2)>
<8, (12, 2, 14)>
<8, (4, 14, 5)>
<8, (14, 5, 4)>
