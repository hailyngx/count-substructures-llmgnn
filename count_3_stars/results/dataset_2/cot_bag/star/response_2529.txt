Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 10}
- Node 4: {6, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 4, 5, 9, 13}

The nodes that can form 3-stars are nodes 5, 9, and 13 because they have at least 3 neighbors. 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
For node 5, there are 6 possible 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 6 possible 3-stars.
For node 13, there are 15 possible 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [6 + 6 + 15] = 27.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<13, (1, 7, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 14)>
<13, (10, 12, 14)>
<13, (10, 12, 5)>
<13, (10, 12, 1)>
<13, (10, 12, 6)>
<13, (10, 12, 7)>
<13, (10, 12, 13)>
<13, (10, 12, 0)>
<13, (10, 12, 2)>
<13, (10, 12, 3)>
<13, (10, 12, 11)>
<13, (10, 6, 14)>
