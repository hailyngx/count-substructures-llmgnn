Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Since the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (total of 11 nodes), we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 1: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 2: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 4: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 8: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 9: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 10: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 11: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 12: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- For node 13: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 14: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of $ 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 71 $

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 71, which we write as [71]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 11)>, <1, (3, 8, 13)>, <2, (0, 11, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 10)>, <8, (1, 13, 14)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>.
