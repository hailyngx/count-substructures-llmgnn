Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: Nodes 4 and 7.
- It can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: Nodes 4, 8, 1, and 3.
- It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, and <2, (8, 1, 3)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: Nodes 7, 8, 0, 5, 1, and 2.
- It can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 5)>, <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 1)>, <4, (8, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 5, 1)>, <4, (0, 5, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, and <4, (5, 1, 2)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: Nodes 6, 4, 7, 8, and 3.
- It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 4)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, <5, (7, 3, 4)>, <5, (7, 3, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>, and <5, (4, 0, 3)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: Nodes 5, 1, 7, and 2.
- It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, and <6, (1, 7, 2)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: Nodes 6, 9, 4, 0, 3, and 5.
- It can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>, and <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: Nodes 2 and 7.
- It can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 58 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 5)>, <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 1)>, <4, (8, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 5, 1)>, <4, (0, 5, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 4)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, <5, (7, 3, 4)>, <5, (7, 3, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
