Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 5) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 19) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (10, 9) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 12) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 28) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 24) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 24) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 20) (20, 17) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 15) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 12) (3, 12) (3, 6) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 24) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (13, 27) (18, 16) (18, 15) (24, 29) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 with neighbors: 7, 26, 9, 12
- Node 4 with neighbors: 23, 28, 12
- Node 5 with neighbors: 17, 29, 16, 12
- Node 7 with neighbors: 21, 23, 1
- Node 9 with neighbors: 10, 1, 15, 24
- Node 12 with neighbors: 1, 20, 4, 5, 3
- Node 16 with neighbors: 0, 28, 18, 5, 15
- Node 17 with neighbors: 29, 20, 5
- Node 19 with neighbors: 22, 26, 24
- Node 20 with neighbors: 17, 28, 12, 24
- Node 21 with neighbors: 7, 26, 2, 11
- Node 23 with neighbors: 7, 22, 8, 4, 27
- Node 24 with neighbors: 29, 19, 20, 9
- Node 26 with neighbors: 21, 1, 19, 28
- Node 28 with neighbors: 26, 16, 4, 20
- Node 29 with neighbors: 17, 27, 5, 24

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of the nodes with three or more neighbors and summing up, we get 43 3-stars inside brackets []. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (23, 28, 12)>, <4, (23, 27, 29)>, <4, (23, 27, 13)>, <5, (17, 29, 16)>, <5, (17, 29, 24)>, <7, (21, 26, 1)>, <7, (23, 22, 8)>, <9, (10, 1, 15)>, <9, (10, 1, 24)>, <20, (17, 28, 20)>, <20, (17, 28, 24)>, <20, (28, 16, 18)>, <24, (29, 19, 20)>, <26, (21, 1, 19)>, <26, (21, 2, 6)>, <27, (23, 29, 13)>, <29, (17, 5, 24)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 43 inside brackets [].
