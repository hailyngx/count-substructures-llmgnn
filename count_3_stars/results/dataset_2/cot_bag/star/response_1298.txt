Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's identify which nodes meet this criteria:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes that meet the criteria:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding the total number of 3-stars for each node: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <6, (7, 0, 5)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <6, (7, 2, 0)>
