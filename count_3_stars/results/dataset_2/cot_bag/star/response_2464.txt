Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 7}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
