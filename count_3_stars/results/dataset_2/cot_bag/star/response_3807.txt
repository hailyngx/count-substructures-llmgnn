Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 17.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (15, 14, 9)>
- <2, (15, 16, 17)>
- <5, (13, 12, 10)>
- <6, (18, 11, 13)>
- <9, (3, 14, 7)>
- <10, (15, 12, 16)>
- <12, (5, 13, 17)>
- <13, (5, 12, 1)>
- <17, (16, 2, 11)>
