Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Based on the degrees, the nodes that can potentially form 3-stars are nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 11)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 10)>
<11, (3, 5, 6)>
<13, (0, 12, 14)>
<14, (1, 7, 13)>
