Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 3) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (8, 16) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, and 19. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are 3 neighbors {7, 3, 13}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 2, there are 4 neighbors {5, 1, 11, 13}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are 3 neighbors {0, 14, 17}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 4, there are 3 neighbors {7, 9, 17}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 5, there are 3 neighbors {6, 2, 14}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 6, there are 3 neighbors {5, 1, 12}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 7, there are 4 neighbors {4, 0, 19, 17}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are 4 neighbors {4, 11, 18, 2}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 10, there are 3 neighbors {15, 12, 19}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 12, there are 3 neighbors {6, 10, 1}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 14, there are 4 neighbors {5, 11, 19, 3}, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 17, there are 3 neighbors {4, 7, 3}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 19, there are 3 neighbors {7, 10, 14}, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24 \).
Therefore, there are a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (7, 3, 13)>
<2, (5, 1, 11)>
<3, (0, 14, 17)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<5, (6, 2, 14)>
<6, (5, 12, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 19)>
<9, (4, 11, 18)>
<10, (15, 12, 19)>
<12, (6, 10, 1)>
<14, (5, 11, 19)>
<17, (4, 7, 3)>
<19, (7, 10, 14)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
