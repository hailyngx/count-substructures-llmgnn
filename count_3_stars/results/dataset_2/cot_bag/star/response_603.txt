Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we consider each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 6, 4, 8, 2, 7, 0
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 7)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>, <0, (6, 8, 7)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (8, 2, 7)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 7
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (9, 6, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 6, 0
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>

Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0
Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 2, 0, 3
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 2, 0)>, <7, (9, 2, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (2, 0, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 58
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
