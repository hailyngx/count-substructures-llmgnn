Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (12, 22) (12, 8) (0, 20) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 6) (1, 26) (1, 8) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 3) (29, 14) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 3) (25, 15) (25, 23) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (14, 26) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 10) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 21) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 3) (9, 0) (9, 24) (21, 11) (3, 29) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 24) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 14) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 17) (13, 28) (13, 6) (6, 20) (6, 18) (6, 13) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 10) (19, 23) (19, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars as follows:

1. Check each node:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: nodes 20, 9, 22, and 2, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: nodes 26, 8, and 7, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 15, 26, 0, and 3, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 29, 16, 2, and 10, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: nodes 15, 29, and 23, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors: nodes 20, 18, and 13, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 16, and 10, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors: nodes 12 and 1, so no 3-star is formed.
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors: nodes 0 and 24, so no 3-star is formed.
   - Node 10 has 4 neighbors: nodes 7, 14, 3, and 22, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 11 has 3 neighbors: nodes 18, 14, and 21, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 14 has 5 neighbors: nodes 26, 29, 11, 24, and 10, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 15 has 4 neighbors: nodes 27, 2, 25, and 5, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 16 has 4 neighbors: nodes 4, 28, 7, and 3, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 20 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 22, and 6, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 22 has 4 neighbors: nodes 12, 0, 20, and 10, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 23 has 3 neighbors: nodes 25, 5, and 19, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 24 has 4 neighbors: nodes 9, 14, 10, and 17, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 26 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 14, 2, and 17, forming 1 3-star.
   - Node 29 has 4 neighbors: nodes 28, 5, 3, and 14, forming 1 3-star.

2. Total number of 3-stars: 17.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (20, 9, 22)>
<1, (26, 8, 7)>
<2, (15, 26, 3)>
<3, (29, 16, 10)>
<5, (15, 29, 23)>
<6, (20, 18, 13)>
<7, (1, 16, 10)>
<10, (7, 14, 3)>
<11, (18, 14, 21)>
<14, (26, 29, 10)>
<15, (27, 25, 5)>
<16, (4, 28, 3)>
<20, (0, 22, 6)>
<22, (12, 20, 10)>
<23, (25, 5, 19)>
<24, (9, 14, 10)>
<26, (1, 14, 17)>
<29, (28, 5, 14)>
