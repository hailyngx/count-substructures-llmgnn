Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15: 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 17: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 18: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 19: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \]

So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (11, 16, 19)>, 
<1, (4, 17, 18)>, 
<4, (1, 17, 15)>, 
<5, (2, 6, 19)>, 
<6, (3, 13, 15)>, 
<10, (7, 13, 18)>, 
<11, (0, 7, 10)>, 
<12, (2, 15, 19)>, 
<13, (6, 10, 14)>, 
<15, (4, 12, 14)>.
