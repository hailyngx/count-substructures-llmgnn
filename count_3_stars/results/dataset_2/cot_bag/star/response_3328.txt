Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
