Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 14)>, <7, (1, 5, 14)>, <11, (1, 7, 14)>, <14, (1, 5, 7)>
