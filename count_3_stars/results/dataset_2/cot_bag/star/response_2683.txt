Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 50 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
