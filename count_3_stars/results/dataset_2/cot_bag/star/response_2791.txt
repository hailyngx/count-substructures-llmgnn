Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 19)>, <2, (9, 11, 15)>, <4, (12, 14, 17)>, <12, (10, 13, 16)>, <13, (7, 11, 18)>, <18, (0, 6, 15)>, <19, (1, 6, 7)>.
