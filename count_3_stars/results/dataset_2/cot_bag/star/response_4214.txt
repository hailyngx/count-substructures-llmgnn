Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So, it can form 5 3-stars.
  <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
  <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. So, it can form 5 3-stars.
  <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, and 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
  <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5 + 4 + 5 + 4] = [18].
