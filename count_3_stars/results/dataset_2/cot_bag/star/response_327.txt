Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 3) (10, 12) (4, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, and 17. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 17)>, <0, (17, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 17, 8)>, <0, (17, 8, 5)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (0, 17, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 15)>, <5, (17, 0, 6)>, <5, (17, 6, 18)>, <5, (6, 0, 15)>, <5, (6, 18, 14)>, <5, (0, 15, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 10)>, <5, (15, 3, 19)>, <5, (3, 10, 12)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 9, 2)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (8, 11, 13)>, <9, (11, 13, 19)>, <9, (8, 13, 12)>, <9, (13, 12, 1)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <12, (10, 13, 1)>, <12, (14, 10, 1)>, <12, (13, 1, 9)>, <12, (10, 1, 14)>
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <14, (6, 12, 18)>, <14, (17, 12, 1)>, <14, (6, 18, 2)>, <14, (17, 1, 7)>, <14, (12, 1, 13)>, <14, (18, 2, 8)>, <14, (6, 2, 18)>, <14, (17, 7, 15)>, <14, (6, 14, 18)>, <14, (18, 8, 17)>
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <15, (5, 19, 7)>
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <17, (14, 0, 5)>, <17, (6, 14, 18)>, <17, (12, 1, 13)>, <17, (0, 5, 15)>, <17, (18, 2, 8)>, <17, (14, 18, 6)>, <17, (1, 13, 12)>, <17, (5, 15, 19)>, <17, (14, 6, 18)>, <17, (2, 8, 18)>

Total number of 3-stars: [44]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 17)>, <5, (0, 17, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 15)>, <5, (17, 0, 6)>, <5, (17, 6, 18)>, <5, (6, 0, 15)>, <5, (6, 18, 14)>, <5, (0, 15, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 10)>, <5, (15, 3, 19)>, <5, (3, 10, 12)>, <8, (0, 9, 2)>, <9, (8, 11, 13)>, <9, (11, 13, 19)>, <9, (8, 13, 12)>, <9, (13, 12, 1)>, <12, (10, 13, 1)>, <12, (14, 10, 1)>, <12, (13, 1, 9)>, <12, (10, 1, 14)>, <14, (6, 12, 18)>, <14, (17, 12, 1)>, <14, (6, 18, 2)>, <14, (17, 1, 7)>, <14, (12, 1, 13)>, <14, (18, 2, 8)>, <14, (6, 2, 18)>, <14, (17, 7, 15)>, <14, (6, 14, 18)>, <14, (18, 8, 17)>, <15, (5, 19, 7)>, <17, (14, 0, 5)>, <17, (6, 14, 18)>, <17, (12, 1, 13)>, <17, (0, 5, 15)>, <17, (18, 2, 8)>, <17, (14, 18, 6)>, <17, (1, 13, 12)>, <17, (5, 15, 19)>, <17, (14, 6, 18)>, <17, (2, 8, 18)>
