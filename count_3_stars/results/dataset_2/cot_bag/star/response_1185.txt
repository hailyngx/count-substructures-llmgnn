Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 16) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 16) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (5, 18) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 13, 2, 18, 0, 14, 3, 11, 4, 17, 15, 10, 16, 1, and 12.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 6 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 9 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 13 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 2 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 18 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 0 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 14 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 3 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 11 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 4 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 17 (degree 4): ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 15 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 10 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 16 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 1 (degree 3): ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 12 (degree 2): No 3-star formed

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 10, 18)>
<9, (6, 17, 13)>
<13, (9, 8, 16)>
<2, (11, 15, 4)>
<18, (6, 14, 17)>
<0, (8, 14, 15)>
<14, (18, 0, 16)>
<3, (9, 8, 17)>
<11, (2, 19, 15)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
<17, (9, 18, 3)>
