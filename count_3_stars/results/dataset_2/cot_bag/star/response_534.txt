Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \).
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [94].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 11)>
<2, (0, 5, 11)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 10)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<10, (7, 5, 8)>
<11, (0, 2, 5)>
<13, (7, 8, 10)>
