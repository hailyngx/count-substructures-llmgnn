Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

So, there are 61 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 12)>, <0, (6, 9, 12)>, <0, (6, 10, 14)>, <0, (9, 10, 14)>, <2, (4, 9, 10)>, <2, (5, 9, 10)>, <2, (8, 11, 14)>, <2, (8, 11, 6)>, <2, (8, 14, 11)>, <2, (8, 14, 6)>, <3, (0, 12, 14)>, <3, (11, 8, 14)>, <3, (11, 8, 6)>, <3, (11, 14, 8)>, <3, (11, 14, 6)>, <4, (2, 9, 10)>, <4, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (13, 1, 12)>, <4, (13, 1, 10)>, <5, (2, 10, 14)>, <5, (10, 2, 14)>, <6, (0, 9, 12)>, <7, (4, 9, 10)>, <8, (2, 11, 14)>, <8, (2, 11, 6)>, <8, (2, 14, 11)>, <8, (2, 14, 6)>, <8, (8, 11, 14)>, <8, (8, 11, 6)>, <8, (8, 14, 11)>, <8, (8, 14, 6)>, <10, (2, 5, 14)>, <10, (5, 2, 14)>, <10, (7, 9, 13)>, <10, (13, 4, 7)> <10, (13, 4, 10)>, <13, (1, 4, 12)>, <13, (4, 10, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [61].
