Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: No 3-star formed
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: No 3-star formed
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: No 3-star formed
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 14)>, <1, (5, 8, 14)>, <1, (6, 8, 14)>, <2, (4, 13, 1)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <5, (9, 6, 10)>, <5, (9, 6, 14)>, <5, (9, 8, 14)>, <5, (6, 10, 13)>, <5, (6, 13, 0)>, <5, (6, 13, 10)>, <5, (8, 13, 11)>, <5, (10, 13, 0)>, <5, (10, 13, 11)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <6, (5, 9, 14)>, <6, (5, 10, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <8, (9, 12, 13)>, <8, (13, 12, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <9, (5, 6, 14)>, <9, (5, 10, 13)>, <9, (6, 10, 13)>, <12, (6, 7, 13)>, <13, (12, 2, 11)>, <14, (5, 6, 9)>, <14, (5, 9, 4)>, <14, (5, 9, 7)>, <14, (5, 6, 7)>
