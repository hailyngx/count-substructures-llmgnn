Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars:  
\( [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [36] \)

So, there are 36 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
