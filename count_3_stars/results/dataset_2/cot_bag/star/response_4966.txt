Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
(8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
(5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) 
(6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) 
(0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
(7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) 
(9, 8) 
(1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
(3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
(2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 5, 1, 6 
2. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 4, 9, 0, 6, 1, 7 
3. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 2, 3, 7 
4. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 5, 1, 3 
5. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 8, 7, 3 
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 8, 5, 0, 1 
7. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 6, 7, 2 
8. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 0, 2 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 66 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 66 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [66]
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 1>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 3>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 3>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 3>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 5, 4>, <7, 5, 0>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 5, 8>, <9, 8, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 2>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 6, 2>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 1, 7>
