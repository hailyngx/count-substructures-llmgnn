Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 0 and 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 13, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up gives a total of 46 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 7, 12)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 14)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 2)>, 
<5, (13, 10, 14)>, 
<6, (8, 3, 14)>, 
<7, (12, 13, 11)>, 
<10, (7, 13, 5)>, 
<11, (8, 13, 9)>, 
<12, (7, 13, 0)>, 
<13, (5, 12, 10)>
