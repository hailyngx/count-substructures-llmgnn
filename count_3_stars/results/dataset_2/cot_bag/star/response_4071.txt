Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the provided information, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. There are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, and so on until <0, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, and <1, (3, 5, 0)>.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, and <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars similar to node 1.
- Nodes 4 and 5 are not centers of any 3-star as they only have 3 neighbors each.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, and others.
- Node 7 and node 8 are not centers of any 3-star formation.
- Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars similar to node 6.

Summing up the number of 3-stars formed by each node, we find there are 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 3-stars in total. Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [52].
