Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 20) (21, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 24) (29, 26) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 25) (13, 27) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (25, 29) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 19) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 7) (9, 29) (9, 15) (2, 22) (2, 4) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 2) (3, 17) (3, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (11, 0) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 9) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 27) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 5) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 10) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 10) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 \times 15 + 10 + 1 = 61 \)

Thus, there are 61 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 11, 25)>
<1, (7, 23, 27)>
<4, (2, 10, 16)>
<5, (12, 20, 27)>
<7, (15, 20, 25)>
<8, (0, 10, 26)>
<10, (3, 4, 25)>
<11, (0, 6, 25)>
<14, (0, 19, 22)>
<16, (4, 17, 23)>
<17, (12, 16, 24)>
<20, (5, 7, 29)>
<22, (2, 14, 22)>
<24, (17, 26, 29)>
<25, (1, 4, 27)>
<26, (8, 24, 29)>
<27, (1, 13, 23)>
<29, (9, 20, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].
