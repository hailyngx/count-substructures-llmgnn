Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors
Node 10: 2 neighbors
Node 11: 3 neighbors
Node 12: 3 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 11: 1 3-star
Node 12: 1 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 80 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 80. 
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ [80] \]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 14)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 14)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (3, 13, 9)>, <11, (1, 5, 9)>, <12, (2, 6, 9)>, <13, (3, 9, 14)>, <14, (2, 6, 13)>
