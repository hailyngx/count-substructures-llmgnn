Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) (0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
(5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 16) 
(4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) 
(8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) 
(2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 0) 
(1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 12) 
(3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 3) 
(0, 18) (0, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (12, 4) 
(12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 15) (6, 2) (6, 15) 
(16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (14, 5) (15, 13) 
(15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars based on the given rules mentioned earlier and find the total.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
For each node with three or more neighbors, we will count the number of 3-stars formed.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: <2, (12, 6, 19)>, total 1 3-star
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (12, 7, 17)>, total 1 3-star
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: <11, (9, 7, 18)>, total 1 3-star
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: <12, (4, 2, 15)>, total 1 3-star
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: <15, (13, 19, 6)>, total 1 3-star
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: <16, (8, 1, 0)>, total 1 3-star
Node 18 has 4 neighbors: <18, (13, 2, 0)>, total 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [7].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (12, 6, 19)>
<4, (12, 7, 17)>
<11, (9, 7, 18)>
<12, (4, 2, 15)>
<15, (13, 19, 6)>
<16, (8, 1, 0)>
<18, (13, 2, 0)>
