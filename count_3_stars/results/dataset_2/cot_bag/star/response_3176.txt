Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (10, 4) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (14, 1) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Here is the list of such nodes along with their neighbors:

- Node 1: {5, 9, 18, 19, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 7, 19, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 2, 17}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 19}
- Node 11: {3, 13, 15}
- Node 13: {11, 0, 16, 6}
- Node 15: {11, 10, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 7, 15}
- Node 18: {19, 16, 1}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 18, 19)>
- <1, (5, 9, 14)>
- <1, (5, 9, 18)>
- <1, (5, 9, 19)>
- <1, (9, 18, 19)>
- <1, (9, 5, 18)>
- <1, (9, 5, 19)>
- <1, (18, 5, 9)>
- <1, (18, 9, 19)>
- <1, (19, 5, 9)>
- <1, (19, 9, 18)>
- <3, (11, 7, 19)>
- <3, (11, 12, 19)>
- <3, (3, 12, 19)>
- <3, (3, 7, 11)>
- <4, (9, 8, 4)>
- <4, (9, 10, 4)>
- <4, (8, 10, 4)>
- <4, (10, 15, 4)>
- <7, (3, 12, 19)>
- <9, (5, 1, 19)>
- <9, (5, 18, 19)>
- <9, (5, 19, 18)>
- <9, (1, 18, 19)>
- <11, (3, 13, 11)>
- <13, (11, 16, 13)>
- <15, (10, 17, 15)>
- <17, (15, 10, 17)>
- <18, (16, 13, 18)>
