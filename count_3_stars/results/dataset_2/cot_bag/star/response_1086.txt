Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 10) (15, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 9) (12, 3) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

0: 1, 4, 13, 16  
1: 0  
2: 5, 16, 17, 18  
3: 7, 12, 16  
4: 0, 10, 17  
5: 2, 18  
6: 8, 13  
7: 3, 8, 18  
8: 6, 7, 9, 10  
9: 8, 15, 19  
10: 4, 8, 15  
11: 13, 14  
12: 3, 18  
13: 0, 6, 11  
14: 11, 16, 17  
15: 9, 10  
16: 0, 2, 3, 14  
17: 2, 4, 14, 19  
18: 2, 5, 7, 12, 17, 19  
19: 9, 17, 18  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2, 8, 17, and 18 have 4 neighbors each. They contribute 4 each to the total.
- Node 0, 4, 9, 10, 14, and 19 have 3 neighbors each. They contribute 1 each to the total.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [ 4(4) + 6(1) ] = [ 16 + 6 ] = [ 22 ].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<2, (5, 16, 18)>  
<8, (6, 7, 9)>  
<17, (2, 14, 19)>  
<18, (5, 7, 19)>  
<0, (1, 4, 13)>  
<4, (0, 10, 17)>  
<9, (8, 15, 19)>  
<10, (4, 8, 15)>  
<14, (11, 16, 17)>  
<19, (17, 18, 9)>  
<0, (13, 16, 4)>
