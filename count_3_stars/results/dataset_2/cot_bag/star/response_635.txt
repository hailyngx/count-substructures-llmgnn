Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now let's find 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {6, 14, 15, 16}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 0.
<0, (6, 14, 15)>, 
<0, (6, 14, 16)>, 
<0, (6, 15, 16)>, 
<0, (14, 15, 16)>.  

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 13, 14}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 2.
<2, (1, 4, 13)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 14)>, 
<2, (1, 13, 14)>, 
<2, (4, 13, 14)>.  

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {2, 8, 11, 19}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 4.
<4, (2, 8, 11)>, 
<4, (2, 8, 19)>, 
<4, (2, 11, 19)>, 
<4, (8, 11, 19)>.  

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 12, 18}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 6.
<6, (0, 3, 12)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 18)>, 
<6, (0, 12, 18)>, 
<6, (3, 12, 18)>.  

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {4, 10, 11, 13}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 8.
<8, (4, 10, 11)>, 
<8, (4, 10, 13)>, 
<8, (4, 11, 13)>, 
<8, (10, 11, 13)>.  

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {10, 14, 16, 18}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 9.
<9, (10, 14, 16)>, 
<9, (10, 14, 18)>, 
<9, (10, 16, 18)>, 
<9, (14, 16, 18)>.  

Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 9, 11}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 10.
<10, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<10, (1, 8, 11)>, 
<10, (1, 9, 11)>, 
<10, (8, 9, 11)>.  

Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 8}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 11.
<11, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<11, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<11, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<11, (4, 7, 8)>.  

Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {2, 5, 8, 13}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 13.
<13, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<13, (2, 5, 13)>, 
<13, (2, 8, 13)>, 
<13, (5, 8, 13)>.  

Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {2, 9, 14}. There is only 1 3-star with node 14.
<14, (2, 9, 14)>.  

Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 9, 19}. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 16.
<16, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<16, (0, 5, 19)>, 
<16, (0, 9, 19)>, 
<16, (5, 9, 19)>.  

Node 17 has 2 neighbors: {1, 7}. There is no 3-star with node 17 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37$. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].
