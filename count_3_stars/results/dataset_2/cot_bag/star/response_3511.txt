Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 3: No 3-star can be formed.
- For node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- For node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 26. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (7, 17, 10)>
<1, (9, 4, 15)>
<2, (8, 18, 0)>
<5, (6, 13, 19)>
<8, (2, 16, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<9, (6, 17, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 1, 9)>
<14, (8, 15, 11)>
<16, (8, 0, 3)>
<16, (8, 10, 0)>
<16, (8, 2, 14)>
<17, (9, 7, 11)>
<17, (7, 10, 11)>
<17, (7, 10, 19)>
<17, (10, 16, 11)>
<17, (10, 11, 19)>
<17, (11, 19, 14)>
<17, (11, 14, 7)>
