Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 18)>
- <0, (5, 8, 19)>
- <0, (5, 13, 18)>
- <0, (8, 13, 18)>
- <0, (3, 8, 18)>
- <1, (7, 10, 13)>
- <1, (7, 10, 1)>
- <3, (6, 9, 15)>
- <3, (6, 9, 18)>
- <3, (6, 8, 18)>
- <3, (9, 15, 18)>
- <5, (2, 8, 13)>
- <5, (2, 8, 19)>
- <5, (2, 13, 19)>
- <6, (7, 9, 15)>
- <6, (7, 9, 3)>
- <7, (1, 10, 13)>
- <9, (6, 15, 18)>
- <10, (1, 13, 18)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
