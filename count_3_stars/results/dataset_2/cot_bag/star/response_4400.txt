Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (3, 29) (25, 15) (25, 9) (25, 12) (20, 8) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (8, 20) (8, 19) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 16) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 4) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 29) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 21) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 8) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 29) (22, 10) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 21) (9, 25) (9, 17) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 23) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 18) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 20) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get a total of \(4+4+4+4+4+4+4+10+4+4+4+4+1+1+4 = 52 \).

Therefore, there are [52] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 1, 17>
- <4, 0, 14, 26>
- <5, 6, 24, 29>
- <6, 5, 20, 16>
- <7, 13, 2, 21>
- <14, 0, 11, 7>
- <15, 16, 20, 24>
- <16, 5, 20, 6>
- <25, 9, 17, 4>
- <26, 14, 28, 0>
- <28, 6, 21, 4>
- <29, 24, 10, 7>
