Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 2)>
- <3, (7, 0, 5)>
- <3, (7, 0, 9)>
