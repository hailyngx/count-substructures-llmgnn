Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 18) (12, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (11, 16), (17, 0), (0, 9), (0, 10)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (15, 3), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 15)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (18, 4), (4, 7), (4, 3)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 15), (6, 17), (6, 19)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (16, 7), (7, 4), (7, 19)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 15), (9, 18), (0, 9), (9, 8)
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: (10, 18), (10, 5), (10, 0)
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (15, 3), (13, 15), (6, 15), (9, 15)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: (16, 11), (16, 7), (2, 16), (14, 16)
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (17, 0), (17, 18), (6, 17), (13, 17)
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: (18, 4), (18, 1), (18, 9), (10, 18), (17, 18)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (19, 7), (19, 5), (6, 19)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0] = [6] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 17, 10)>, <3, (4, 15, 1)>, <3, (4, 15, 9)>, <9, (0, 15, 18)>, <15, (3, 13, 6)>, <0, (9, 10, 17)>
