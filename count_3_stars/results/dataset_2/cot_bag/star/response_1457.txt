Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 22) (15, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 22) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 8) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 21) (2, 5) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 4) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (11, 2) (28, 2) (28, 19) (28, 10) (24, 6) (24, 14) (4, 15) (4, 26) (27, 8) (27, 14) (27, 16) (7, 22) (7, 1) (7, 16) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 27) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 17) (6, 24) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 21) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 0) (21, 12) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 29) (12, 19) (12, 21) (12, 29) (23, 20) (23, 2) (29, 10) (29, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors (5, 15, 8, 26, 7), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 23, 28, 11), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors (15, 10, 13, 8, 22), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors (22, 1, 16), so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (13, 1, 27), so it forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 15 has 5 neighbors (3, 1, 18, 22, 4), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 18 has 4 neighbors (5, 15, 22, 1), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 19 has 4 neighbors (26, 21, 28, 12), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 21 has 4 neighbors (25, 19, 0, 12), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 22 has 5 neighbors (15, 18, 17, 7, 25), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 25 has 3 neighbors (22, 20, 21), so it forms 1 3-star.
13. Node 26 has 4 neighbors (1, 19, 14, 4), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 28 has 4 neighbors (2, 19, 10, 29), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 53 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].
