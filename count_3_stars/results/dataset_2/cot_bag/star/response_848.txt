Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars for node 5}
\]
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars for node 4}
\]
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars for node 6}
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars for node 9}
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars for node 1}
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars for node 7}
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars for node 0}
\]

Summing these up: 
\[10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46\]

Therefore, there are 46 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:

\[
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
\]
\[
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
\]
\[
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
\]
\[
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
\]
\[
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
\]
\[
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
\]
\[
<0, (9, 6, 1)>
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ [46] = 46 \]
