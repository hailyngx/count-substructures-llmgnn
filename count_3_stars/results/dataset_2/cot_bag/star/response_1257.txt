Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 28) (9, 11) (26, 19) (26, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 4) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 17) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 10) (19, 26) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 25) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (21, 11) (21, 22) (7, 6) (7, 17) (25, 19) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 22) (14, 15) (14, 18) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 18) (17, 23) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 2) (5, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 12) (12, 20) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 16) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 21) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 10) (10, 20) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (11, 19, 24)>, <1, (3, 6, 22)>, <3, (1, 28, 4)>, <8, (6, 11, 15)>, <9, (11, 28, 29)>, <11, (0, 8, 21)>, <15, (8, 19, 20)>, <18, (14, 28, 23)>, <19, (0, 15, 25)>, <20, (3, 10, 15)>, <22, (1, 2, 29)>, and <28, (13, 18, 28)>.
