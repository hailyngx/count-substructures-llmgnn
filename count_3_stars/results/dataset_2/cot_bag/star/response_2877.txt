Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (7, 9, 3)>
<8, (9, 5, 0)>
<9, (2, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
