Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 2, 8  
Node 1: 4, 3  
Node 2: 9, 4, 7, 8, 0  
Node 3: 9, 4, 7, 1, 6  
Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 2  
Node 5: 6, 0  
Node 6: 5, 3, 8  
Node 7: 4, 0, 3, 8  
Node 8: 9, 7, 6, 2, 0  
Node 9: 8, 2, 3, 0

There are 4 nodes with 5 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9), so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of them.

There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of them.

Collecting all the 3-stars, we have a total of [4 * 10 + 3 * 4] = [40 + 12] = [52] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 9, 7)>  
<2, (9, 4, 8)>  
<8, (9, 7, 6)>  
<9, (8, 3, 0)>
