Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (16, 3) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 13) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 6, 9, 14, 17, 12, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 17, 0
- Total number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (9, 17, 0)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 18
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 17, 3, 1, 19, 5
- Total number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 14 as the center: <14, (17, 3, 1)>, <14, (17, 3, 19)>, <14, (17, 3, 5)>, <14, (17, 1, 19)>, <14, (17, 1, 5)>, <14, (17, 19, 5)>, <14, (3, 1, 19)>, <14, (3, 1, 5)>, <14, (3, 19, 5)>, <14, (1, 19, 5)>

For node 17:
- Node 17 has 6 neighbors: 6, 14, 19, 5, 15, 1
- Total number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 17 as the center: <17, (6, 14, 19)>, <17, (6, 14, 5)>, <17, (6, 14, 15)>, <17, (6, 14, 1)>, <17, (6, 19, 5)>, <17, (6, 19, 15)>, <17, (6, 19, 1)>, <17, (6, 5, 15)>, <17, (6, 5, 1)>, <17, (6, 15, 1)>, <17, (14, 19, 5)>, <17, (14, 19, 15)>, <17, (14, 19, 1)>, <17, (14, 5, 15)>, <17, (14, 5, 1)>, <17, (14, 15, 1)>, <17, (19, 5, 15)>, <17, (19, 5, 1)>, <17, (19, 15, 1)>, <17, (5, 15, 1)>

For node 12:
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 2, 0, 11
- Total number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 12 as the center: <12, (4, 7, 2)>, <12, (4, 7, 0)>, <12, (4, 7, 11)>, <12, (4, 2, 0)>, <12, (4, 2, 11)>, <12, (4, 0, 11)>, <12, (7, 2, 0)>, <12, (7, 2, 11)>, <12, (7, 0, 11)>, <12, (2, 0, 11)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 18, 12, 13
- Total number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (8, 18, 13)>, <4, (8, 18, 12)>, <4, (8, 13, 12)>, <4, (18, 13, 12)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 45
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].
