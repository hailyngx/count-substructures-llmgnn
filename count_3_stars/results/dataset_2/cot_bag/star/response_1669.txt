Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0), (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (7, 9), (7, 0), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 0), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 2)

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 4 neighbors (9, 7, 8, 2), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 1: It has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 3, 4), so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 2: It has 3 neighbors (5, 8, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 3: It has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 6, 1, 4), so it can form 10 3-stars.
For node 4: It has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 1, 3, 8), so it can form 10 3-stars.
For node 5: It has 4 neighbors (2, 8, 4, 3), so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 6: It has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 3, 4), so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 7: It has 2 neighbors (9, 0), so it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 8: It has 4 neighbors (5, 4, 2, 0), so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 9: It has 5 neighbors (6, 3, 1, 7, 0), so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

For the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 8, 2)>, <1, (9, 6, 3)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (9, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (6, 2, 1)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>
