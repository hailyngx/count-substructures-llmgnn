Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 3, 4, 2, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 3, 2
- Node 2: 5, 9, 1, 0
- Node 3: 9, 1, 0
- Node 4: 6, 7, 0
- Node 5: 9, 2, 8, 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7, 4, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 6, 4, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7, 0
- Node 9: 5, 2, 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

For Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 1: There is only 1 3-star formed: <1, (5, 2, 6)>
For Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 3: There is only 1 3-star formed: <3, (9, 1, 0)>
For Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding all these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
