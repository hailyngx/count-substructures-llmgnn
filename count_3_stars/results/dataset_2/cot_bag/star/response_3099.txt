Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 7: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 9: <4, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is just 2, and the final answer is [2].
