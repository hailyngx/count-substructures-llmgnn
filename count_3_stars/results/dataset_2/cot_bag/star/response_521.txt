Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 0) (19, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 17) (6, 17) (6, 12) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 18), (0, 14), (0, 1), (0, 19)
Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 15), (5, 16)
Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 15), (8, 12)
Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 12)
Node 12: (12, 9), (12, 3), (12, 15), (12, 8), (12, 6)
Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 18)
Node 15: (15, 5), (15, 8), (15, 12), (15, 16)
Node 18: (18, 2), (18, 19), (18, 0), (18, 13)
Node 19: (19, 4), (19, 18), (19, 0), (19, 17)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 14, 19)>
<5, (2, 15, 16)>
<8, (9, 12, 15)>
<12, (3, 8, 15)>
<12, (6, 8, 15)>
<13, (5, 11, 18)>
<18, (2, 13, 19)>
<19, (0, 4, 17)>
