Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (17, 7) (17, 19) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (19, 17) (19, 18) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 15) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - a total of 15 nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [ Inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: [ Inom{5}{3} ] = 10 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [ Inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = [ 39 ]

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (8, 13, 14)>, <2, (1, 6, 16)>, <2, (6, 13, 16)>, <2, (6, 13, 16)>, <2, (6, 16, 13)>, <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (7, 14, 17)>, <3, (12, 14, 1)>, <3, (12, 14, 3)>, <4, (6, 12, 16)>, <6, (11, 13, 16)>, <6, (13, 16, 2)>, <8, (0, 9, 14)>, <9, (2, 13, 16)>, <9, (2, 6, 16)>, <9, (8, 13, 15)>, <9, (13, 15, 2)>, <12, (1, 3, 14)>,  <13, (0, 16, 9)>, <13, (2, 8, 9)>, <13, (6, 8, 9)>, <13, (8, 9, 0)>, <14, (0, 3, 8)>, <15, (5, 8, 18)>, <15, (8, 16, 18)>
