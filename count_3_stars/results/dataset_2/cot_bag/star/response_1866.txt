Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1 as central node.
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as central node.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as central node.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as central node.
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as central node.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as central node.

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, there are 62 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>

<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
