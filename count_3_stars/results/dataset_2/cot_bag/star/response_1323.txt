Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: 
- 0: {9, 3, 8}  
- 1: {9, 6, 2, 8}  
- 2: {9, 4, 1, 8, 6}  
- 3: {7, 0, 6}  
- 4: {5, 6, 2}  
- 5: {6, 8, 4, 7}  
- 6: {5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2}  
- 7: {5, 9, 3, 6}  
- 8: {5, 1, 2, 0}  
- 9: {2, 1, 7, 0}

Next, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors to count the 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (6, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 2)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms five 3-stars: 
  - <6, (5, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (5, 1, 3)>
  - <6, (5, 1, 2)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 3)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 1)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (2, 1, 7)>

Adding up the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.
