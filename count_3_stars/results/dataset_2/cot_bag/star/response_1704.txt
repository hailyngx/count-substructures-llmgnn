Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes. Here are the steps:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
6. Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all the 3-stars together: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [40]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
