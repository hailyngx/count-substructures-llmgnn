Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

For node 0, it has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 1, it has 5 neighbors (4, 6, 9, 8, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 3, it has 4 neighbors (4, 9, 8, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 4, it has 5 neighbors (7, 8, 3, 5, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 5, it has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 2, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 6, it has 6 neighbors (7, 9, 5, 1, 2, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 7, it has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 8, it has 4 neighbors (4, 0, 3, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 9, it has 4 neighbors (7, 6, 3, 1), so it can form 1 3-star.  

Adding up the number of 3-stars formed by each node gives a total of 9 3-stars in the graph <0, (6, 8, 3)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <5, (4, 6, 2)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (7, 6, 3)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
