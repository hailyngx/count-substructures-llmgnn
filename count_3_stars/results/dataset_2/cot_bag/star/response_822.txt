Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 10) (22, 5) (22, 10) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 2) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 24) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 15) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 18) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 26) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 16) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 15) (26, 29) (26, 0) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 21) (19, 5) (19, 12) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 11) (7, 20) (7, 28) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 23) (16, 9) (3, 17) (3, 27) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 24) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 23) (24, 8) (24, 17) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 11) (27, 21) (27, 3) (18, 29) (18, 5) (18, 12) (12, 19) (12, 18) (11, 20) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 13) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 21) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by considering each node that has 3 or more neighbors. We will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes with 3 or more neighbors along with the number of 3-stars they contribute:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (18, 19, 21)>
- <9, (1, 16, 4)>
- <13, (10, 4, 16)>
- <16, (23, 9, 29)>
- <19, (5, 21, 14)>
- <21, (15, 19, 28)>
- <23, (25, 1, 6)>
- <25, (2, 20, 5)>
- <28, (14, 15, 29)>
- <29, (18, 23, 26)>
