Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 22) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 11) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 6) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 17) (0, 28) (7, 3) (7, 5) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 12) (29, 21) (29, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (14, 20) (1, 11) (1, 25) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 10) (17, 26) (17, 28) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 22) (18, 9) (18, 29) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 22) (19, 29) (19, 25) (20, 14) (2, 9) (2, 21) (10, 6) (10, 3) (12, 29) (12, 18) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 16) (4, 13) (4, 24) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 2) (21, 5) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 15, 27, 8, 13, 23, 26, 28, 29, 14, 6, 17, 25, 18, 3, 11, 9, 22, 24, 4, and 21.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inof{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inof{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed gives us a total of [74] unique 3-stars:

<15, (22, 23, 5)>, <15, (22, 23, 8)>, <15, (22, 23, 6)>, <15, (23, 8, 5)>, <13, (11, 4, 16)>, <26, (6, 17, 28)>, <26, (6, 17, 14)>, <26, (6, 17, 3)>, <26, (6, 17, 10)>, <26, (26, 17, 28)>, <26, (28, 0, 17)>, <26, (28, 0, 24)>, <26, (28, 24, 17)>, <23, (6, 15, 8)>...
