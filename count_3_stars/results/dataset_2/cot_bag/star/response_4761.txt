Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 7) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 15) (8, 21) (8, 5) (8, 16) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 20) (1, 13) (1, 10) (26, 2) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (28, 22) (28, 4) (17, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 27) (2, 26) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 15) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 16) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 3) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 19) (3, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 16) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:

Node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
<6, (11, 19, 21)>
<6, (11, 21, 7)>
<6, (19, 9, 21)>

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (21, 22, 23)>
<7, (21, 22, 27)>
<7, (21, 23, 12)>
<7, (22, 27, 18)>

Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<12, (2, 3, 23)>
<12, (2, 3, 11)>
<12, (3, 19, 27)>
<12, (3, 23, 7)>

Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<15, (5, 13, 21)>
<15, (5, 13, 16)>
<15, (5, 16, 8)>
<15, (13, 16, 21)>

Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<16, (2, 14, 24)>
<16, (2, 14, 15)>
<16, (2, 24, 8)>
<16, (2, 24, 14)>
<16, (2, 24, 15)>
<16, (14, 15, 16)>
<16, (14, 15, 24)>
<16, (14, 24, 8)>
<16, (14, 24, 15)>
<16, (15, 24, 8)>

Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<21, (7, 10, 21)>
<21, (7, 10, 14)>
<21, (7, 10, 15)>
<21, (7, 14, 21)>
<21, (7, 15, 13)>
<21, (10, 14, 21)>
<21, (10, 15, 13)>
<21, (14, 15, 16)>
<21, (14, 15, 21)>
<21, (14, 21, 8)>

Node 22: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
<22, (7, 27, 18)>
<22, (7, 21, 23)>
<22, (21, 27, 18)>

Node 23: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
<23, (7, 12, 20)>
<23, (7, 20, 5)>
<23, (12, 20, 5)>

Node 24: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
<24, (14, 16, 18)>
<24, (14, 16, 15)>
<24, (14, 18, 27)>

Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<27, (3, 9, 27)>
<27, (3, 10, 27)>
<27, (3, 18, 22)>
<27, (9, 10, 27)>

Node 29: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
<29, (0, 3, 13)>
<29, (0, 3, 27)>
<29, (0, 13, 15)>

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
