Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 4, 8, 3, 0, 7, 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>.
