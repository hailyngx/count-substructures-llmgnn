Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<0, (9, 5, 6)>
<0, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 0)>
