Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 25) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 6) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 19) (26, 18) (26, 12) (6, 8) (6, 27) (24, 29) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 23) (29, 24) (29, 1) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 14) (25, 21) (25, 22) (20, 27) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 2) (19, 3) (27, 21) (27, 6) (27, 20) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 28) (13, 14) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 22) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 13) (4, 10) (4, 20) (15, 17) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 20) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 5 with 5 neighbors
- Node 7 with 5 neighbors
- Node 21 with 5 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors
- Node 17 with 4 neighbors
- Node 22 with 4 neighbors
- Node 3 with 5 neighbors
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors
- Node 16 with 3 neighbors
- Node 25 with 2 neighbors
- Node 12 with 4 neighbors
- Node 13 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors
- Node 14 with 3 neighbors
- Node 20 with 4 neighbors
- Node 27 with 3 neighbors
- Node 28 with 2 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors (5, 7, 21, 3), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node, so a total of 40 3-stars.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (8, 9, 17, 22, 12, 20), there are 4 3-stars for each node, so a total of 24 3-stars.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (18, 16, 25, 13, 11, 14, 27), there is 1 3-star for each node, so a total of 7 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [40 + 24 + 7] = [71] \) 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 11, 14)>
- <7, (17, 21, 23)>
- <21, (3, 25, 27)>
- <3, (0, 16, 19)>
- <8, (2, 5, 18)>
- <9, (16, 22, 29)>
- <17, (7, 10, 11)>
- <22, (12, 25, 9)>
- <12, (13, 21, 26)>
- <20, (4, 23, 27)>
- <18, (0, 26, 8)>
- <16, (14, 3, 9)>
- <25, (12, 21)>
- <13, (2, 12, 14)>
- <11, (5, 17, 22)>
