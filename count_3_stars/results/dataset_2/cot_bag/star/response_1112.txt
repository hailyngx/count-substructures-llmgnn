Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 4) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 10) (3, 22) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 27) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 21) (21, 28) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 5) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 14) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 25) (23, 27) (27, 8) (27, 23) (27, 20) (29, 26) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 4) (20, 22) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 7) (13, 4) (13, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (24, 10) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph are: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) [Not enough neighbors]
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 69 \)

[69]

Unique 3-stars: <2, (10, 12, 24)>, <4, (8, 22, 18)>, <6, (26, 23, 0)>, <7, (17, 14, 20)>, <10, (17, 24, 2)>, <12, (2, 14, 18)>, <14, (2, 12, 7)>, <17, (11, 10, 28)>, <18, (5, 13, 20)>, <20, (4, 22, 7)>, <22, (3, 24, 10)>, <23, (25, 6, 5)>, <24, (10, 14, 2)>, <26, (29, 6, 4)>
