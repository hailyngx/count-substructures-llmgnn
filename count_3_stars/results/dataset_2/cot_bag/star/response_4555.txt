Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can now determine the total number of 3-stars and then list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 12), (0, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 13), (1, 12), (1, 11)
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 10)
- Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 7), (5, 4), (5, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 3)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 0), (9, 12)
- Node 11: (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 7), (11, 1)
- Node 12: (12, 9), (12, 8), (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 1)
- Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 1), (13, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 12)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get the total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 91

So, there are a total of 91 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9, 12)>
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 12, 5)>
<0, (9, 12, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (13, 7, 4)>
<8, (6, 13, 11)>
<8, (6, 13, 8)>
<8, (6, 2, 9)>
<8, (6, 2, 8)>
<8, (13, 11, 7)>
<8, (13, 11, 1)>
<8, (13, 7, 14)>
<8, (13, 10, 5)>
<8, (13, 14, 9)>
<8, (13, 14, 7)>
<8, (2, 9, 10)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<11, (8, 13, 7)>
<12, (9, 8, 14)>
<12, (9, 8, 0)>
<12, (9, 14, 12)>
<12, (9, 0, 5)>
<13, (8, 11, 7)>
<13, (8, 11, 1)>
<13, (8, 7, 14)>
<13, (8, 10, 5)>
<13, (8, 14, 9)>
<13, (8, 14, 7)>
<13, (2, 10, 3)>
<14, (9, 13, 7)>
<14, (9, 13, 14)>
<14, (9, 7, 12)> 

Therefore, the final count of unique 3-stars in the graph is [31].
