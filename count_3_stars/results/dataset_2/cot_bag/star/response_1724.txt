Response:
There are multiple ways we can approach this problem, but a systematic way is to consider each node and count how many 3-stars are formed with that node as the center.

Let's go through each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (29, 2, 18), (2, 7, 20), (2, 29, 16), and (2, 18, 20). Hence, there are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (15, 3, 16), (3, 4, 19), (3, 9, 28), and (3, 15, 19). Thus, there are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 4, 18), (4, 14, 19), (4, 8, 24), and (4, 19, 14). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 6, 20), (12, 11, 25), (12, 20, 6), and (12, 11, 25). Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 12 as the center.

5. Node 14 has 3 neighbors: (14, 4, 10). Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center.

6. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (15, 3, 16). So, there is 1 3-star with node 15 as the center.

7. Node 16 has 5 neighbors: (16, 5, 25), (16, 22, 29), (16, 15, 19), (16, 22, 25), and (16, 15, 29). Thus, there are 5 3-stars with node 16 as the center.

8. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (18, 10, 11), (18, 2, 8), (18, 8, 10), and (18, 2, 10). Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 18 as the center.

9. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: (20, 12, 6), (20, 2, 0), (20, 12, 25), and (20, 13, 2). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 20 as the center.

10. Node 22 has 3 neighbors: (22, 14, 10). Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 22 as the center.

11. Node 24 has 4 neighbors: (24, 1, 8), (24, 28, 5), (24, 1, 5), and (24, 5, 8). Thus, there are 4 3-stars with node 24 as the center.

12. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: (25, 12, 20), (25, 16, 22), (25, 12, 11), and (25, 16, 27). Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 25 as the center.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of 36 unique 3-stars. Hence, there are [36] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 18, 20>, <2, 7, 20>, <2, 18, 29>, <2, 29, 16>, <3, 4, 19>, <3, 9, 28>, <3, 15, 19>, <4, 8, 18>, <4, 14, 19>, <4, 8, 24>, <12, 6, 20>, <12, 11, 25>, <14, 4, 10>, <15, 3, 16>, <16, 5, 25>, <16, 15, 19>, <16, 22, 25>, <18, 2, 10>, <18, 8, 10>, <18, 10, 11>, <20, 2, 0>, <20, 13, 2>, <20, 12, 6>, <24, 1, 5>, <24, 1, 8>, <24, 5, 8>, <24, 28, 5>, <25, 12, 11>, <25, 12, 20>, <25, 16, 22>, <25, 16, 27>, <2, 29, 16>, <10, 18, 11>, <16, 22, 29>, <16, 15, 29>, <3, 9, 28>, <20, 12, 25>.
