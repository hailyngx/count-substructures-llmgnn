Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 10, 4, 8, 14, 13, 7, 12, 1, 3, and 2.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these all up: 

\[ [20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 ] = [94] \]

Therefore, there are 94 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<6, (1, 2, 13)>
<10, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 12)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
