Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].
