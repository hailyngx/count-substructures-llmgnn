Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 13) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
