Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of $\binom{10}{3} = 120$ possible 3-stars in this graph. 
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 8: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 9: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of $10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38$ 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is $[38]$.

The unique 3-stars are:
