Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the central nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 1, 0
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 2, 3, 1
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 1, 3, 0
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 1
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 1)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
