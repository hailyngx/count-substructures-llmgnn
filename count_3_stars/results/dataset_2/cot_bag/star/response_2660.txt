Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 100

So, there are a total of [100] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars are: <0, (9, 13, 2)>, <1, (4, 10, 2)>, <2, (1, 4, 3)>, <3, (2, 11, 14)>, <4, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 9, 13)>, <8, (11, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>, <10, (12, 1, 3)>, <11, (8, 2, 3)>, <13, (8, 9, 0)>.
