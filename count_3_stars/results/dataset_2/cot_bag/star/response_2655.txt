Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 11) (3, 14) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 21) (12, 1) (12, 29) (27, 23) (27, 6) (28, 19) (28, 2) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 6) (0, 15) (0, 25) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 20) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 17) (8, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 13) (25, 0) (25, 17) (25, 16) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 22) (19, 23) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 5) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 29) (6, 16) (20, 14) (20, 4) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 8) (21, 24) (24, 14) (24, 7) (24, 21) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 25) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 18) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 8 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 22 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 25 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms 3 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 64 3-stars.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
