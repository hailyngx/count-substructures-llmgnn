Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 22) (18, 7) (22, 16) (22, 18) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (10, 11) (10, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 14) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 0) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 9) (29, 4) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 8) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 24) (15, 28) (21, 23) (21, 0) (24, 17) (24, 9) (24, 15) (28, 5) (28, 19) (28, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 15) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 22, 25, 3, 25, 0, 7, 5, 17, 19, 9, 29, 6, 12, 15, 24, 28, 27, 14, and 4.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 25 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 27 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 50 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 50 3-stars in the given graph. Putting this result inside brackets: [50].
The unique 3-stars found are: <11, (10, 9, 29)>, <16, (12, 22, 11)>, <25, (0, 29, 1)>, <25, (3, 29, 1)>, <25, (1, 3, 0)>, <25, (29, 4, 1)>, <0, (25, 8, 7)>, <5, (19, 28, 10)>, <5, (14, 28, 15)>, <5, (10, 19, 28)>, <5, (28, 15, 19)>, <5, (14, 15, 28)>, <9, (1, 29, 24)>.
