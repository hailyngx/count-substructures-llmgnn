Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 18) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 4 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 27. 

Therefore, the final answer is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (4, 6, 16)>
<3, (7, 12, 14)>
<4, (5, 9, 10)>
<9, (1, 10, 15)>
<10, (0, 2, 15)>
<11, (7, 16, 18)>
<11, (16, 18, 19)>
<12, (3, 2, 13)>
<13, (3, 5, 12)>
<14, (1, 3, 17)>
<15, (9, 10, 16)>
<16, (0, 11, 15)>
<18, (6, 11, 17)>
