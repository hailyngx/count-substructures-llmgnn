Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 1: neighbors 6, 27, 7
- Node 2: neighbors 12, 27, 19, 6, 10
- Node 4: neighbors 12, 13, 5
- Node 5: neighbors 23, 4, 8
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 26, 2, 20
- Node 7: neighbors 1, 9, 16
- Node 9: neighbors 29, 10, 16, 7
- Node 10: neighbors 9, 2, 0
- Node 11: neighbors 28, 14, 15
- Node 12: neighbors 22, 4, 17, 2, 13
- Node 15: neighbors 22, 11, 21, 0, 14
- Node 16: neighbors 9, 7
- Node 20: neighbors 24, 19, 8, 6
- Node 21: neighbors 3, 29, 26, 15
- Node 22: neighbors 15, 12
- Node 23: neighbors 5, 0, 24
- Node 24: neighbors 23, 20
- Node 26: neighbors 29, 21, 6
- Node 27: neighbors 1, 25, 2
- Node 29: neighbors 9, 26, 21

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:  
- Node 18: neighbors 17, 25, 27 (only forms 1 3-star)  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \):
    - Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
    - Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
    - Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    
Summing up the total, we have: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1] = [49] \]

Hence, there are 49 unique 3-stars in this graph. Let's list a few:
<1, (6, 27, 7)>
<2, (12, 27, 19)>
<4, (12, 13, 5)>
<5, (23, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 26, 2)>
<7, (1, 9, 16)>
<12, (22, 4, 17)>
<15, (22, 11, 21)>
<27, (1, 25, 2)>
<29, (9, 26, 21)>
  
Feel free to explore more combinations within the 49 unique 3-stars in the graph!
