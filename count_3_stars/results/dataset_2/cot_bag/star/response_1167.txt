Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors, meaning they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9. Since it has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8. It can also form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. It can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7. It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9. It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9. It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9. It can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars that can be formed: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
