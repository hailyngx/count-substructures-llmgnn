Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (7, 1) (7, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (3, 16) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
The graph described has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

1: 8, 5, 7
2: 16, 17
3: 16, 4
4: 6, 3, 0
5: 8, 19, 1
6: 9, 18, 4, 13
7: 1, 19
8: 16, 9, 1, 18
9: 11, 6, 8
10: 12
11: 16
12: 17, 10, 19
13: 6, 14, 15
14: 18, 15, 13
15: 16, 14, 13, 19
16: 11, 15, 3, 8, 2
17: 12, 2
18: 6, 14, 8, 5
19: 5, 15, 7, 0, 12

Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 
Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of 46 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [46]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (8, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 3, 0)>, <5, (8, 19, 1)>, <6, (9, 18, 4)>, <8, (16, 9, 1)>, <9, (11, 6, 8)>, <12, (17, 10, 19)>, <13, (6, 14, 15)>, <14, (18, 15, 13)>, <15, (16, 14, 13, 19)>, <16, (11, 15, 3, 8, 2)>, <18, (6, 14, 8, 5)>, <19, (5, 15, 7, 0, 12)>
