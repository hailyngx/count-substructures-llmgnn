Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (5, 4) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 19) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (9, 2) (9, 15) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 19) (13, 10) (13, 16) (13, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 7) (18, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].
