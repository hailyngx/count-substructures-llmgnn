Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 11, 12, 14
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 10, 11, 13, 14
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 12, 14
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 10, 11, 12, 14
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
Node 11 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8, 13
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 9, 2
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 13

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up these, we get a total of 50 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 14)>
<7, (4, 10, 12)>
<11, (2, 8, 13)>
<14, (3, 4, 13)>
