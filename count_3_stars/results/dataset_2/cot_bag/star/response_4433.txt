Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

There are two nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 17 and 18. These nodes each form 1 3-star. 

For the remaining nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we can use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars for each node. 

- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all these 3-stars gives us a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<17, (13, 19, 15)>
<18, (1, 14, 24)>
<2, (15, 29, 8)>
<8, (2, 29, 6)>
<9, (26, 1, 23)>
<12, (22, 26, 7)>
<14, (27, 28, 3)>
<23, (9, 27, 6)>
<26, (9, 21, 11)>
<28, (20, 14, 23)>
<29, (9, 2, 8)>
