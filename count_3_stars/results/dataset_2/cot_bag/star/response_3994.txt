Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{0} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{2}{1} = 2
- Node 5: inom{2}{1} = 2
- Node 6: inom{3}{2} = 3
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 16: inom{2}{1} = 2
- Node 17: inom{2}{1} = 2
- Node 18: inom{2}{1} = 2
- Node 19: inom{3}{2} = 3

Adding these up, we get a total of 55 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (9, 10, 13)>, <2, (17, 5, 15)>, <2, (17, 11, 15)>, <2, (8, 5, 15)>, <2, (8, 17, 15)>, <4, (19, 9, 0)>, <4, (19, 18, 12)>, <5, (7, 11, 17)>, <5, (7, 19, 6)>, <6, (7, 19, 14)>, <9, (12, 10, 0)>, <9, (12, 11, 13)>, <10, (0, 15, 13)>, <12, (14, 11, 13)>, <12, (14, 18, 13)>, <13, (15, 11, 0)>, <14, (19, 12, 7)>, <15, (6, 13, 7)>, <16, (14, 1, 19)>, <18, (13, 12, 19)>
