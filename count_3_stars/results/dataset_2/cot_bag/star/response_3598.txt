Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 5, 6, 14, 9, and 13. 

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are the center of:  

1. Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.  
2. Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.  
3. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.  
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.  
5. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
6. Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.  
7. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.  
9. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.  
10. Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.  
11. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
12. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.  

Summing up all the possible 3-stars formed by these nodes:  
20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 110

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [110].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
1. <4, (7, 10, 6)>  
2. <7, (4, 11, 3)>  
3. <1, (5, 12, 14)>  
4. <3, (1, 13, 7)>  
5. <10, (4, 11, 5)>  
6. <11, (7, 10, 5)>  
7. <12, (1, 11, 10)>  
8. <5, (1, 10, 14)>  
9. <6, (4, 14, 0)>  
10. <14, (4, 6, 8)>  
11. <9, (7, 11, 14)>  
12. <13, (4, 3, 2)>
