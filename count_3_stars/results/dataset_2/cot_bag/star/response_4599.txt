Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 10, 11, and 14.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (7, 9, 14)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 13)>, <9, (2, 8, 13)>, <9, (2, 6, 13)>, <9, (0, 6, 13)>, <9, (0, 8, 13)>, <6, (0, 7, 13)>, <6, (2, 7, 13)>, <10, (1, 8, 11)>, <10, (1, 8, 12)>, <10, (1, 11, 12)>, <10, (1, 11, 14)>, <11, (4, 12, 14)>, <14, (1, 4, 11)>, <14, (1, 11, 12)>
