Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (6, 3, 2)>, <0, (6, 3, 7)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>
  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <1, (3, 5, 14)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 14)>, <1, (5, 8, 14)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (1, 11, 13)>, <5, (1, 11, 14)>, <5, (1, 13, 14)>, <5, (11, 13, 14)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <7, (6, 3, 11)>, <7, (6, 3, 0)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (6, 11, 5)>, <7, (6, 11, 10)>,
  <7, (6, 5, 10)>, <7, (3, 11, 5)>, <7, (3, 11, 10)>, <7, (3, 5, 10)>, <7, (11, 5, 10)>,

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <8, (9, 2, 1)>, <8, (9, 2, 12)>, <8, (9, 1, 12)>, <8, (2, 1, 12)>
  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <9, (6, 11, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 8)>, <9, (6, 13, 8)>, <9, (11, 13, 8)>, <9, (3, 1, 14)>,
  <9, (3, 1, 5)>, <9, (3, 14, 5)>, <9, (1, 14, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 12)>, <9, (8, 2, 13)>

- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <10, (3, 11, 7)>, <10, (3, 11, 12)>, <10, (3, 7, 12)>, <10, (11, 7, 12)>
  
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <11, (9, 10, 5)>, <11, (9, 10, 12)>, <11, (9, 5, 12)>, <11, (10, 5, 12)>, <11, (1, 3, 5)>,
  <11, (1, 3, 14)>, <11, (1, 5, 14)>, <11, (3, 5, 14)>, <11, (7, 6, 0)>, <11, (7, 6, 5)>,
  <11, (7, 0, 5)>, <11, (6, 0, 5)>, <11, (14, 2, 5)>, <11, (14, 2, 12)>, <11, (14, 5, 12)>,
  <11, (2, 5, 12)>, <11, (2, 13, 5)>, <11, (2, 13, 12)>, <11, (5, 12, 13)>, <11, (5, 12, 14)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <12, (14, 2, 8)>, <12, (14, 2, 5)>, <12, (14, 2, 0)>, <12, (2, 8, 5)>
  
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <14, (2, 12, 5)>, <14, (2, 12, 8)>, <14, (2, 12, 11)>, <14, (12, 5, 11)>

Adding up all these combinations, we get a total of 88 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [88].
