Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 9, 5, 6, 8, and 0.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
