Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Based on the given edge information:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {8, 0, 5, 6}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 9, 4, 3}
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {3, 1, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {7, 9, 4, 5}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {8, 0, 4, 1}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {7, 9, 1}
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {6, 9, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {6, 9, 5, 0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- No 3-stars from nodes 2 and 3
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<8, (7, 5, 4)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<0, (4, 5, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
