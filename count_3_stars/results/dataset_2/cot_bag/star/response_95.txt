Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (3, 10) (3, 19) (2, 28) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 16) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 29) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (0, 23) (0, 6) (14, 23) (14, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 7) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 21) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 11) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 28) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 27) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 22) (12, 21) (12, 5) (12, 28) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 22) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 24) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (24, 4) (24, 22) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 25) (27, 6) (27, 13) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: node 9, node 10, and node 16. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (8, 10, 29, 7)
   Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 10, 29)>, <9, (8, 10, 7)>, <9, (8, 29, 7)>, <9, (10, 29, 7)>

2. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: (3, 8, 9, 16, 26)
   Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (3, 8, 9)>, <10, (3, 8, 16)>, <10, (3, 8, 26)>, <10, (3, 9, 16)>, <10, (3, 9, 26)>, <10, (3, 16, 26)>, <10, (8, 9, 16)>, <10, (8, 9, 26)>, <10, (8, 16, 26)>, <10, (9, 16, 26)>

3. Node 16 has 5 neighbors: (18, 8, 23, 10, 21)
   Number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   3-stars with node 16 as the center: <16, (18, 8, 10)>, <16, (18, 8, 23)>, <16, (18, 8, 21)>, <16, (18, 10, 23)>, <16, (18, 10, 21)>, <16, (18, 23, 21)>, <16, (8, 10, 23)>, <16, (8, 10, 21)>, <16, (8, 23, 21)>, <16, (10, 23, 21)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
