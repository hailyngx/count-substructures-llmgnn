Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify which nodes have at least three neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

From the given information, the nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 14, 7), the number of 3-stars associated with node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- For node 2: It has 4 neighbors (9, 4, 14, 7), resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: With 5 neighbors (9, 1, 3, 10, 2), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5: It has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 13, 14), leading to \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14: Since all these nodes have exactly 3 neighbors, each node forms only 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 8, 14)>, 
<2, (9, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (9, 1, 3)>, 
<5, (6, 8, 13)>, 
<6, (9, 3, 11)>, 
<8, (10, 11, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 10, 4)>, 
<10, (8, 11, 4)>, 
<11, (10, 7, 12)>, 
<14, (5, 0, 2)>.
