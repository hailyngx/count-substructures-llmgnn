Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 18) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 14) (3, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (19, 16) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 15) (6, 18) (6, 15) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node and see if it forms a 3-star. Let's go through the process:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

- Node 0: Forms 4 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 16)>, <0, (2, 14, 16)>, <0, (4, 13, 16)>, <0, (4, 14, 16)>

- Node 1: Forms 5 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <1, (5, 8, 16)>, <1, (5, 9, 16)>, <1, (8, 9, 16)>, <1, (9, 13, 16)>, <1, (9, 16, 18)>

- Node 2: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <2, (0, 16, 18)>, <2, (0, 2, 18)>, <2, (0, 12, 18)>

- Node 4: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <4, (0, 13, 16)>, <4, (0, 10, 16)>, <4, (10, 13, 16)>

- Node 7: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <7, (13, 15, 18)>, <7, (13, 15, 6)>, <7, (15, 6, 18)>

- Node 9: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <9, (5, 13, 17)>, <9, (5, 17, 1)>, <9, (13, 17, 1)>

- Node 12: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <12, (2, 13, 17)>, <12, (13, 17, 1)>, <12, (2, 13, 17)>

- Node 13: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <13, (4, 7, 15)>, <13, (4, 7, 15)>, <13, (7, 15, 18)>

- Node 14: Forms 1 3-star
    - 3-star: <14, (0, 3, 7)>

- Node 15: Forms 1 3-star
    - 3-star: <15, (7, 11, 6)>

- Node 16: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <16, (0, 1, 4)>, <16, (0, 1, 19)>, <16, (1, 4, 19)>

- Node 17: Forms 1 3-star
    - 3-star: <17, (9, 12, 18)>

- Node 18: Forms 3 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <18, (2, 7, 16)>, <18, (2, 6, 16)>, <18, (7, 6, 16)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 33\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].
