Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9  
2: 1, 5, 7, 8  
3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9  
4: 0, 8  
5: 1, 2, 3, 8  
6: 3, 7, 8, 9  
7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9  
8: 2, 4, 5, 6  
9: 1, 3, 6, 7  

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars  
For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  
For node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars  
For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars  

So, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 44 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [44].
