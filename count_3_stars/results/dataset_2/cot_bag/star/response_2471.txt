Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 4: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 6: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 8: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 9: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 10: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 11: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 13: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 14: C(4,3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [56]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 10, 11)>
<4, (0, 6, 11)>
<6, (4, 10, 1)>
<8, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<10, (4, 6, 11)>
<11, (4, 8, 10)>
<13, (9, 12, 14)>
<14, (4, 12, 13)>
