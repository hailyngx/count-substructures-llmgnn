Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14.

For node 0, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). Therefore, we have <0, (1, 7, 13)>.

For node 1, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). Therefore, we have <1, (0, 4, 12)>.

For node 4, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<4, (8, 10, 12)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 10)>, <4, (1, 8, 10)>, <4, (1, 8, 12)>, <4, (3, 8, 12)>, <4, (3, 10, 12)>, <4, (6, 8, 10)>, <4, (6, 8, 12)>, <4, (6, 10, 12)>.

For node 6, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<6, (7, 10, 11)>, <6, (7, 10, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <6, (10, 11, 13)>, <6, (8, 10, 13)>, <6, (11, 10, 13)>, <6, (6, 13, 8)>, <6, (6, 11, 13)>, <6, (6, 10, 13)>, <6, (6, 7, 13)>.

For node 7, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<7, (0, 5, 13)>, <7, (5, 10, 13)>, <7, (5, 11, 14)>, <7, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 7, 0)>, <7, (2, 7, 5)>, <7, (7, 10, 14)>, <7, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 14)>, <7, (2, 0, 7)>.

For node 9, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<9, (2, 10, 14)>, <9, (2, 12, 13)>, <9, (10, 12, 14)>, <9, (10, 13, 14)>, <9, (12, 13, 14)>, <9, (9, 12, 14)>, <9, (9, 10, 13)>, <9, (9, 10, 14)>, <9, (9, 12, 13)>, <9, (9, 13, 14)>.

For node 10, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<10, (6, 9, 12)>, <10, (6, 9, 14)>, <10, (9, 14, 11)>, <10, (6, 8, 13)>, <10, (6, 11, 14)>, <10, (8, 11, 14)>, <10, (8, 12, 14)>, <10, (8, 10, 14)>, <10, (6, 13, 11)>, <10, (6, 13, 14)>.

For node 12, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<12, (1, 4, 7)>, <12, (1, 4, 10)>, <12, (1, 10, 7)>, <12, (1, 10, 4)>, <12, (4, 7, 10)>, <12, (4, 8, 10)>, <12, (7, 10, 14)>, <12, (8, 10, 14)>, <12, (9, 10, 14)>, <12, (9, 13, 14)>.

For node 14, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<14, (7, 10, 11)>, <14, (7, 10, 5)>, <14, (7, 11, 5)>, <14, (7, 5, 13)>, <14, (7, 13, 5)>, <14, (9, 10, 12)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>, <14, (9, 12, 13)>, <14, (8, 10, 11)>, <14, (8, 11, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 62.
So, the final answer is [62].
