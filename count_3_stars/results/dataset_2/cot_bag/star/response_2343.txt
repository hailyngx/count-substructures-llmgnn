Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are the center of:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
 <0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
 <1, (0, 2, 7)>, 
 <1, (2, 3, 7)>, 
 <1, (2, 9, 8)>, 
 <1, (3, 2, 7)>, 
 <2, (1, 3, 9)>, 
 <2, (3, 1, 9)>, 
 <3, (1, 2, 7)>, 
 <3, (1, 2, 8)>, 
 <4, (0, 5, 6)>, 
 <4, (0, 6, 8)>, 
 <4, (5, 6, 8)>, 
 <5, (0, 4, 7)>, 
 <5, (4, 6, 8)>, 
 <6, (4, 5, 8)>, 
 <7, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
