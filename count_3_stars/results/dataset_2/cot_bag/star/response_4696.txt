Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 10) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

1: 6, 2, 13, 12  
3: 0, 4, 8  
4: 3, 8, 12, 14, 11  
8: 3, 4, 10, 7  
0: 3, 14, 11  
14: 4, 0, 9, 12  
5: 2, 12, 11, 10  
13: 1, 10  
7: 8, 10, 9  
12: 1, 4, 14, 5, 6  
6: 1, 12, 2, 11  
2: 1, 5, 6, 9  
9: 14, 7, 2, 11, 10  
10: 8, 5, 13, 7, 9  
11: 4, 0, 5, 6, 9  

Let's now count the number of 3-stars:

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (3, 8, 12)>
<14, (4, 0, 12)>
<14, (4, 12, 9)>
<12, (1, 4, 5)>
<12, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 12, 2)>
<9, (2, 11, 10)>
<10, (5, 7, 9)>
<11, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 11, 14)>
