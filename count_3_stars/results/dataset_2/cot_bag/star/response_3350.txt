Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 3) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 11) (6, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 19) (15, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (16, 5) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (4, 13) (4, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19.  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
