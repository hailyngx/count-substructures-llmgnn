Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

So, the final answer is [48].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 12, 15)>
<5, (2, 7, 16)>
<7, (5, 4, 13)>
<9, (11, 10, 0)>
<10, (9, 3, 1)>
<12, (2, 16, 15)>
<13, (7, 11, 1)>
<16, (5, 4, 6)>
<18, (17, 3, 1)>
