Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 18) (26, 6) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 15) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 5) (8, 27) (8, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 23) (27, 8) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 18) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 24) (11, 15) (28, 17) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 5) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 15) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 20) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 16) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 25) (2, 10) (2, 24) (17, 0) (17, 28) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 4) (29, 21) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 20) (24, 14) (24, 15) (24, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 18 = 36 \)

Therefore, there are 36 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 16, 20)>, <5, (1, 8, 25)>, <6, (1, 13, 26)>, <7, (13, 18, 12)>, <8, (5, 27, 22)>, <12, (7, 27, 23)>, <14, (1, 6, 24)>, <15, (21, 19, 24)>, <16, (3, 22, 4)>, <18, (26, 7, 23)>, <19, (23, 22, 15)>, <20, (3, 23, 10)>, <21, (1, 29, 15)>, <22, (8, 19, 16)>, <23, (12, 18, 25)>, <24, (14, 15, 2)>, <25, (5, 16, 23)>, <26, (6, 18, 7)>, <27, (8, 12, 7)>, <29, (21, 4, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].
