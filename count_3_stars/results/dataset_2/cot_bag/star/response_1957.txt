Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 18)>
- <2, (5, 12, 15)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 6, 11)>
- <7, (0, 11, 14)>
