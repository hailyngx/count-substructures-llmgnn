Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 2, 9, 10, 12  
Node 1: 3, 9, 10, 12  
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 13  
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 11  
Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 13  
Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 11, 14  
Node 6: 4, 5, 14  
Node 7: 3, 8  
Node 8: 2, 7, 9, 11, 12  
Node 9: 0, 1, 8  
Node 10: 0, 1, 4, 14  
Node 11: 3, 4, 5, 8, 14  
Node 12: 0, 1, 8  
Node 13: 2, 4  
Node 14: 5, 6, 10, 11  

By inspecting the nodes, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, and 14 have at least 3 neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [64].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (0, 8, 13)>  
<2, (4, 5, 13)>  
<2, (4, 8, 13)>  
<2, (4, 11, 13)>  
<2, (5, 11, 13)>  
<4, (2, 5, 14)>  
<4, (3, 5, 6)>  
<4, (3, 10, 11)>  
<4, (6, 10, 14)>  
<4, (6, 11, 14)>  
<5, (2, 11, 14)>  
<5, (3, 6, 14)>  
<5, (3, 11, 14)>  
<5, (6, 11, 14)>  
<8, (2, 9, 12)>  
<8, (4, 9, 12)>  
<8, (4, 12, 13)>  
<8, (9, 12, 13)>  
<8, (10, 11, 14)>  
<11, (4, 10, 14)>  
<11, (4, 5, 14)>  
<11, (5, 10, 14)>  
<11, (8, 10, 14)>  
<14, (4, 10, 11)>  
<14, (4, 10, 13)>  
We found 24 unique 3-stars in total.
