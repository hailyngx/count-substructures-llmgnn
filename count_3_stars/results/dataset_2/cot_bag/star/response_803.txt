Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 22) (5, 12) (9, 8) (9, 13) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 7) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (6, 0) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 25) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 22) (29, 20) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 12) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 2) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 19) (12, 17) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 12) (24, 3) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (1, 18) (1, 25) (25, 28) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors gives: 
1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
