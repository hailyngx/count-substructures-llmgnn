Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The edges are: (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 1), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 0), (8, 6), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 2), (6, 0), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 6), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 6)

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 6
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 3, 6, 8
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, 6
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 1
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 8, 0, 1, 3
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 7
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 2, 0
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 2
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 1, 0, 6
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 2, 1

There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 \]
\[ = 56 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 8, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (9, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<3, (5, 4, 1)>
