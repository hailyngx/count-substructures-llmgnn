Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 10, 8
- Node 1: 7, 3, 6, 2, 14, 13
- Node 2: 7, 1, 13
- Node 3: 1, 11, 10, 9, 5, 12
- Node 4: 7, 8, 13, 14
- Node 5: 3, 11, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 4, 11, 9, 2, 1
- Node 8: 4, 10, 9, 5, 0, 12
- Node 9: 7, 3, 8, 14
- Node 10: 3, 11, 8, 0
- Node 11: 7, 3, 10, 5, 12
- Node 12: 3, 11, 8
- Node 13: 4, 1, 14, 2
- Node 14: 1, 13, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total 3-stars formed = 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 93

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [93].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 13, 14)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 9, 13)>
- <1, (3, 12, 14)>
- <1, (6, 14, 13)>
- <3, (5, 11, 12)>
- <3, (9, 11, 12)>
- <7, (9, 14, 13)>
- <7, (11, 9, 13)>
- <8, (10, 11, 12)>
