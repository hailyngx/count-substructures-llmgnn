Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (16, 19) (5, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 19) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (7, 17, 4)>, <0, (7, 17, 19)>, <0, (7, 4, 19)>, <0, (17, 4, 19)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <1, (3, 11, 2)>, <1, (3, 12, 2)>, <1, (11, 17, 10)>, <1, (11, 18, 2)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <2, (3, 6, 1)>, <2, (3, 18, 6)>, <2, (6, 18, 13)>, <2, (18, 7, 11)>

- Node 3: 1 3-star
  <3, (1, 2, 15)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <6, (2, 4, 13)>, <6, (4, 12, 6)>, <6, (4, 13, 9)>, <6, (9, 13, 0)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <7, (0, 12, 19)>, <7, (0, 17, 19)>, <7, (0, 4, 19)>, <7, (4, 12, 7)>, <7, (4, 19, 14)>, <7, (12, 1, 7)>, <7, (12, 4, 0)>, <7, (12, 19, 14)>, <7, (14, 19, 16)>, <7, (17, 0, 19)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <9, (0, 6, 13)>

- Node 11: 1 3-star
  <11, (1, 17, 10)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <12, (1, 4, 7)>

- Node 13: 1 3-star
  <13, (6, 9, 18)>

- Node 14: 1 3-star
  <14, (5, 19, 8)>

- Node 17: 1 3-star
  <17, (11, 19, 0)>

- Node 18: 1 3-star
  <18, (2, 7, 13)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <19, (7, 14, 16)>, <19, (14, 16, 19)>, <19, (14, 17, 19)>, <19, (16, 17, 19)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
