Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we analyze each node to see if it has at least three neighbors. If a node has three or more neighbors, we can form 3-stars with that node at the center.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
For each node with at least 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 6)>
