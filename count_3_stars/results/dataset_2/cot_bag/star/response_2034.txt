Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 28) (21, 3) (21, 2) (0, 15) (27, 16) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 5) (17, 7) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (26, 15) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 20) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 26) (15, 18) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 22) (11, 23) (11, 14) (23, 11) (23, 29) (23, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 27) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 9) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 13) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 24) (5, 2) (5, 12) (29, 23) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 22) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 4) (20, 28) (25, 28) (9, 16) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (22, 28) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 18) (28, 1) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 22) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 28. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: C(2,3) = 1
- Node 4: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 5: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 6: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 10: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 11: C(2,3) = 1
- Node 14: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 15: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 16: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 17: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 18: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 20: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 21: C(2,3) = 1
- Node 22: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 23: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 24: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 28: C(5,3) = 10

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node gives a total of 53 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (10, 19, 22)>
<10, (4, 17, 24)>
<4, (20, 2, 12)>
<5, (2, 12, 24)>
<6, (14, 19, 24)>
<6, (20, 4, 28)>
<15, (0, 26, 18)>
<16, (23, 9, 4)>
<16, (27, 4, 16)>
<17, (10, 24, 7)>
<22, (28, 8, 10)>
<22, (3, 8, 22)>
<28, (22, 25, 20)>
