Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (16, 2) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 3) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 10, 17, 12, 1, 13, 8, 19, 5, 11, 18, 3, and 6.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- Node 4 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 13, 9)>
<7, (4, 13, 9)>
<10, (17, 1, 19)>
<17, (10, 1, 13)>
<12, (7, 5, 11)>
<1, (17, 11, 18)>
<13, (4, 7, 17)>
<8, (14, 11, 18)>
<19, (10, 3, 6)>
<5, (12, 2, 3)>
<11, (12, 1, 18)>
<18, (10, 1, 3)>
<3, (19, 5, 18)>
<6, (7, 8, 19)>
