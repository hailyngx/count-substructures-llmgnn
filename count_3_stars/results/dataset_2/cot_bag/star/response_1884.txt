Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 54

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
