Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors listed in brackets are as follows:
- Node 0 (5 neighbors): 4, 9, 12, 14
- Node 1 (4 neighbors): 3, 5, 7, 14
- Node 2 (3 neighbors): 9, 13, 14
- Node 3 (3 neighbors): 1, 6, 8
- Node 4 (3 neighbors): 0, 10, 11
- Node 5 (3 neighbors): 1, 8, 13
- Node 6 (5 neighbors): 3, 8, 10, 12, 13
- Node 7 (4 neighbors): 1, 9, 10, 11
- Node 8 (4 neighbors): 3, 5, 6, 11
- Node 9 (5 neighbors): 0, 2, 7, 12, 14
- Node 10 (5 neighbors): 4, 6, 7, 12, 13
- Node 11 (4 neighbors): 4, 7, 8, 11
- Node 12 (5 neighbors): 0, 6, 9, 10, 13
- Node 13 (5 neighbors): 2, 5, 6, 10, 12
- Node 14 (4 neighbors): 0, 1, 2, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node based on its number of neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 9, 12)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 10, 11)>
- <6, (3, 8, 10)>
- <7, (1, 9, 10)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 14)>
- <10, (4, 6, 13)>
- <11, (4, 7, 8)>
- <12, (0, 9, 13)>
