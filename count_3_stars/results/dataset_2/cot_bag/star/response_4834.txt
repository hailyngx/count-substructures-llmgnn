Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 6, 13, 0, 9, and 14. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 12, 9, 13, and 11.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (7, 9, 11)>, <4, (7, 9, 12)>, <4, (7, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 11, 12)>, <4, (7, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 11, 12)>, <4, (9, 11, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (11, 12, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>

2. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 1, and 8.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 2)>, <7, (4, 1, 3)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>

3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 2, 11, 12, and 0.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <6, (5, 2, 12)>, <6, (5, 2, 11)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (5, 12, 11)>, <6, (5, 12, 0)>, <6, (5, 11, 0)>, <6, (2, 11, 12)>, <6, (2, 11, 0)>, <6, (2, 12, 0)>, <6, (12, 11, 0)>

4. Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 14, 12, 11, and 10.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <13, (4, 5, 14)>, <13, (4, 5, 12)>, <13, (4, 5, 11)>, <13, (4, 5, 10)>, <13, (4, 14, 12)>, <13, (4, 14, 11)>, <13, (4, 14, 10)>, <13, (4, 12, 11)>, <13, (4, 12, 10)>, <13, (4, 11, 10)>, <13, (5, 14, 12)>, <13, (5, 14, 11)>, <13, (5, 14, 10)>, <13, (5, 12, 11)>, <13, (5, 12, 10)>, <13, (5, 11, 10)>, <13, (14, 12, 11)>, <13, (14, 12, 10)>, <13, (14, 11, 10)>, <13, (12, 11, 10)>

5. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 14, 3, and 9.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <0, (6, 14, 3)>, <0, (6, 14, 9)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (14, 3, 9)>

6. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 4, 0, 10, 3, and 1.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <9, (4, 0, 10)>, <9, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 0, 1)>, <9, (4, 10, 3)>, <9, (4, 10, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (0, 10, 3)>, <9, (0, 10, 1)>, <9, (0, 3, 1)>, <9, (10, 3, 1)>

7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 0, 11, 2, and 13.
    - Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <14, (0, 2, 11)>, <14, (0, 2, 13)>, <14, (0, 11, 13)>, <14, (2, 11, 13)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\(10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 68\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [68].
