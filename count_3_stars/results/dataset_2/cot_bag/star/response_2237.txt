Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:

Node 0:  Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 3}, degree 4
Node 2:  Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 3}, degree 4
Node 3:  Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 0, 2}, degree 5
Node 4:  Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 0, 6, 3}, degree 6
Node 5:  Neighbors {6, 1, 0, 3}, degree 4
Node 7:  Neighbors {4, 0, 2, 8, 1}, degree 5
Node 8:  Neighbors {9, 4, 7}, degree 3
Node 9:  Neighbors {8, 4, 2}, degree 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 3: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
Node 4: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars
Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 7: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars

Only nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is $4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 48$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 48, written as [48].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars formed:

<0, (5, 7, 0)>
<0, (5, 3, 0)>
<0, (4, 7, 0)>

<2, (1, 7, 2)>
