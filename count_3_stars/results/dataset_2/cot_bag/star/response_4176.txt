Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, and 19.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (4, 7, 19)>        
<0, (4, 16, 19)>        
<0, (7, 12, 19)>
<0, (7, 16, 19)>

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (1, 3, 18)>        
<2, (13, 14, 18)>        
<2, (13, 14, 19)>

<2, (14, 18, 19)>        
<2, (18, 16, 14)>        
<2, (18, 16, 19)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (0, 5, 10)>

Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<7, (12, 15, 19)>        
<7, (12, 16, 19)>        
<7, (12, 0, 19)>        
<7, (12, 15, 0)>        
<7, (16, 18, 19)>        
<7, (16, 18, 15)>        
<7, (16, 18, 0)>        
<7, (16, 15, 19)>        
<7, (16, 15, 0)>        
<7, (16, 19, 0)>
