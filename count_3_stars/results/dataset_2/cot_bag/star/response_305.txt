Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the 3-star graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {5, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 7, 6, 1}
- Node 4: {7, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 3}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 3, 7}

Based on the construction, we find the following 3-stars and the total count:

- Node 7 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total: [44]

Unique 3-stars: 
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
