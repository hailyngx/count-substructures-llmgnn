Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 16) (6, 14) (9, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors

We will focus on the nodes with three or more neighbors as they have the potential to form a 3-star.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 11)>
<1, (2, 8, 18)>
<1, (2, 11, 14)>
<1, (11, 13, 4)>
<1, (11, 13, 14)>
<1, (14, 4, 19)>
<(2, 8, 11), 18>
<(2, 8, 18), 11>
<(2, 11, 14), 18>
<(11, 13, 4), 14>
<(11, 13, 14), 4>
