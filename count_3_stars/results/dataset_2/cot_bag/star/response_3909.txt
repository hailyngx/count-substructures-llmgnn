Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 5, 8}
- 1: {3, 6, 9}
- 2: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 3: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- 4: {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- 5: {0, 9}
- 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- 7: {2, 4, 6}
- 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \).

Therefore, there are 50 3-stars in this graph.
