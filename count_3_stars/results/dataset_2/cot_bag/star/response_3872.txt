Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 2 => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 6, 2 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 1, 3, 8, 0 => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 1, 2 => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 1, 6, 3 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 1, 8 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 0, 3 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, 0 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 3, 7 => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 2, 1)>
<1, (3, 1, 6)>
