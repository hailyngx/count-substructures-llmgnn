Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 5 and node 6. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for node 5 and node 6:

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 0, and 3
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 2, and 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) = 14
Therefore, the answer is [14].

The 3-stars are:
- <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- <5, (6, 8, 3)>
- <5, (8, 0, 3)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <6, (5, 9, 2)>
- <6, (5, 9, 8)>
- <6, (9, 1, 2)>
- <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- <6, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (5, 1, 0)>
- <6, (5, 1, 8)>
- <6, (5, 0, 2)>
- <6, (5, 3, 4)>
