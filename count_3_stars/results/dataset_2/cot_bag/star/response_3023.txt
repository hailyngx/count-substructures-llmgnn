Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can see that the neighbors of each node are as follows:

| Node | Neighbors |
|------|-----------|
| 0    | 7, 9      |
| 1    | 5, 8, 11  |
| 2    | 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 |
| 3    | 6, 7, 11   |
| 4    | 6, 8, 9, 10 |
| 5    | 1, 7, 11, 12, 13 |
| 6    | 2, 3, 4, 11, 14 |
| 7    | 0, 3, 5, 14 |
| 8    | 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 |
| 9    | 0, 4, 8, 10, 12 |
| 10   | 2, 4, 9, 10, 13 |
| 11   | 1, 3, 5, 6 |
| 12   | 2, 5, 9, 13 |
| 13   | 5, 10, 12 |
| 14   | 2, 6, 7 |

Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph:  
- Node 2, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10, with 5 neighbors, can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12, with 4 neighbors, can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14, with 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 65 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:  
<2, (6, 12, 14)>, <5, (1, 11, 13)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 10)>, <9, (4, 8, 10)>, <10, (2, 4, 13)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>, <14, (2, 6, 7)>
