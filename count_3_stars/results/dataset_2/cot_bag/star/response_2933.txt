Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (13, 19) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 18) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (0, 18) (0, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (17, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 10, 11, 4, 18, 1, 15, 8, 14, 7, 0, 3, 19, 2, 6, 16, and 12.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 23

So, there are a total of [23] unique 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
