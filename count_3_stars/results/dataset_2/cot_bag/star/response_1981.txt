Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 1) (4, 19) (4, 26) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 28) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 29) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 2) (15, 25) (15, 16) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 21) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 16) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 3) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 9) (29, 25) (12, 2) (12, 17) (26, 4) (26, 23) (26, 6) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 18) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 29) (1, 22) (1, 28) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

The list of nodes with three or more neighbors is as follows:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 14, 25, 23)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 8, 18, 12)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 20, 11, 21)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 27, 11, 14, 19)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 28, 18, 26)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 11, 24, 28)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 27, 6, 29)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 7, 3, 5, 17)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 22, 17)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 25, 16)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 15, 19, 10)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 6, 2, 24, 21)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 4, 5, 25, 16)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 13, 23, 29, 1)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 22, 0, 26, 29)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 7, 20, 18)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 0, 15, 19, 29)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 4, 23, 6, 10)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 7, 6, 1)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars with the above nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed with each node, we get a total of 37 3-stars in this graph. So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].
