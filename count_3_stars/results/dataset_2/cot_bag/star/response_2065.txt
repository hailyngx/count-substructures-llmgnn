Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 80 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [80]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (2, 0, 7)> 
<1, (3, 8, 7)> 
<0, (1, 13, 5)> 
<0, (6, 4, 5)> 
<0, (9, 12, 5)> 
<2, (1, 13, 7)> 
<2, (4, 6, 14)> 
<6, (10, 8, 4)> 
<10, (14, 9, 2)> 
<13, (3, 9, 0)> 
<13, (12, 9, 0)>
