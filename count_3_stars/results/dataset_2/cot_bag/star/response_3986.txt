Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 12) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 9) (9, 15) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: {8, 10, 13, 17}
2: {6}
3: {12, 13, 14}
4: {10, 11, 16}
5: {7, 15, 17}
6: {2, 19}
7: {5, 15, 16}
8: {1, 15, 18, 19}
9: {15}
10: {1, 4, 14}
11: {4, 11, 12, 19}
12: {3, 11, 14}
13: {1, 3, 17}
14: {10, 12, 18, 3}
15: {5, 7, 8, 9, 18}
16: {4, 7, 17}
17: {1, 13, 16, 5}
18: {8, 14, 15, 19}
19: {6, 8, 11, 18}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is 47.

Therefore, the answer is [47].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 13, 17)>
<1, (8, 13, 1)>
<1, (8, 17, 1)>
<1, (13, 17, 1)>
<3, (12, 14, 3)>
<4, (10, 14, 4)>
<8, (1, 15, 19)>
<10, (4, 14, 10)>
<11, (19, 18, 11)>
<14, (10, 18, 14)>
<15, (7, 8, 18)>
<17, (1, 13, 17)>
<18, (8, 14, 18)>
<19, (6, 11, 19)>
<19, (8, 11, 19)>
