Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 18) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 24) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 10) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 20) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 16) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 18) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 23) (12, 7) (12, 24) (26, 24) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 10) (10, 20) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 16) (8, 28) (8, 27) (8, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 27) (4, 14) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 19) (11, 18) (13, 0) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 0) (25, 21) (25, 28) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 9) (27, 13) 

Response:
From the given edge list, let's first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and determine the total number of 3-stars formed with them.

Nodes with at least three neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 10, 15, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 20: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 23: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 24: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 27: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 28: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 29: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 19, 27>, <0, 13, 27>, <0, 20, 27>, <0, 25, 27>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 29, 27>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 29, 17>, <0, 29, 1>, <0, 20, 5>, <10, 9, 27>, <10, 28, 8>, <10, 16, 8>, <10, 21, 25>, <10, 21, 3>, <15, 1, 29>, <15, 7, 12>, <18, 29, 9>, <18, 17, 29>, <18, 11, 9>, <18, 17, 14>, <20, 5, 6>, <20, 10, 5>, <20, 27, 19>, <20, 0, 19>, <23, 22, 24>, <24, 23, 12>, <24, 26, 3>, <24, 3, 5>, <27, 19, 2>, <27, 19, 0>, <27, 13, 0>, <27, 13, 28>, <29, 1, 15>, <29, 0, 27>, <29, 17, 14>, <29, 18, 17>, <3, 15, 21>, <5, 14, 20>, <5, 6, 16>, <8, 16, 6>, <13, 0, 28>, <15, 3, 24>, <21, 3, 10>
