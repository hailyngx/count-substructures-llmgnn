Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first represent it visually:  

```
      0
     / \
    /   \
   2     4 -- 1
    \   / \  |
     \ /   \ |
      3 -- 7--5
           | 
           9
           |
           8
           |
           6
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
