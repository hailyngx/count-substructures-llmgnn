Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 25) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 25) (23, 11) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (16, 10) (16, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 27) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 27) (8, 12) (8, 7) (21, 18) (21, 16) (21, 26) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 22) (12, 8) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 11) (25, 26) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 25) (26, 17) (20, 28) (17, 5) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 24) (27, 19) (27, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 14) (14, 19) (14, 27) (14, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 2, 15)>
- <3, (2, 15, 18)>
- <3, (2, 15, 25)>
- <3, (2, 18, 5)>
- <3, (15, 4, 11)>
- <11, (4, 7, 25)>
- <15, (3, 25, 29)>
- <18, (2, 5, 7)>
- <18, (5, 7, 21)>
- <19, (1, 14, 27)>
- <21, (7, 16, 26)>
- <22, (2, 12, 19)>
- <25, (9, 11, 26)>
- <26, (10, 16, 21)>
- <27, (14, 19, 24)>
- <29, (6, 15, 23)>
