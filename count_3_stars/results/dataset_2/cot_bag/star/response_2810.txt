Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 1) (2, 12) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 0) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 3) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 16) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 15) (4, 12) (18, 17) (18, 3) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 8) (17, 18) (17, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 27) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 21) (15, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 12) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 23) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 22) (0, 2) (10, 6) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (27, 29) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22, 24, 26, and 29.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
8. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
9. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
10. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
12. Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
13. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
14. Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
15. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes gives a total of 76 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [76].

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (0, 11, 21)>
<3, 24, 27, (18, 29)>
<5, (9, 11, 22)>
<7, 1, 14, 19>
<8, 1, 20, 21>
<9, (1, 5, 24), 29>
<11, 1, 2, 23>
<12, 2, 4, 21>
<13, 16, 26, 27>
<16, 13, 17, 28>
