Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors, namely nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are 1 3-star <0, (6, 10, 7)>.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving node 1.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 3.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 5.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 7.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 9.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving node 12.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 67

There are 67 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final answer: [67].
