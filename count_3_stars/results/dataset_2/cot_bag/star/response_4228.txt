Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 2, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 0, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 8, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 2, 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, 3, 1.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)> -> 1 3-star
- For node 2: <2, (0, 4, 9)> and <2, (7, 8, 9)> -> 2 3-stars
- For node 3: <3, (1, 4, 9)> and <3, (2, 4, 9)> -> 2 3-stars
- For node 4: <4, (0, 2, 9)> and <4, (3, 2, 9)> -> 2 3-stars
- For node 6: <6, (8, 9, 5)> -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1] = [8]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (3, 2, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 5)>
