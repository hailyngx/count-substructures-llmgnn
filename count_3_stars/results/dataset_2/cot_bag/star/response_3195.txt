Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 13) (1, 27) (3, 10) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 25) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 10) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 26) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 21) (26, 22) (26, 27) (26, 4) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 2) (24, 1) (24, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 24) (15, 1) (15, 23) (21, 23) (21, 17) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 22) (14, 4) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 13) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 18) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node and then sum them up:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: Not applicable (exactly 3 neighbors required)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9]. The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (15, 24, 13)>
- <1, (15, 24, 28)>
- <1, (15, 23, 10)>
- <1, (1, 27, 12)>
- <4, (25, 26, 14)>
- <11, (29, 20, 17)>
- <11, (29, 20, 24)>
- <11, (29, 25, 13)>
- <13, (19, 28, 25)>
