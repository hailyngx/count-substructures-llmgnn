Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 8) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 13) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 10) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors (16, 9, 18, 4). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.
2. Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors (14, 1, 19, 4). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.
3. Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors (14, 17, 13). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
4. Node 6: This node has 3 neighbors (11, 10, 19). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
5. Node 7: This node has 3 neighbors (16, 15, 10). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
6. Node 8: This node has 3 neighbors (17, 2, 10). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
7. Node 10: This node has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 12, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.
8. Node 11: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 15). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
9. Node 12: This node has 3 neighbors (18, 4, 10). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
10. Node 13: This node has 4 neighbors (14, 5, 15, 19). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.
11. Node 14: This node has 3 neighbors (3, 13, 5). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
12. Node 15: This node has 4 neighbors (11, 9, 13, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.
13. Node 16: This node has 2 neighbors (0, 7), not enough for a 3-star.
14. Node 18: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 0, 12). So, there's only 1 3-star here.
19. Node 19: This node has 4 neighbors (6, 3, 13, 11). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars here.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes that qualify, we get a total of 27 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is given by: [27].
