Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (18, 9, 5, 16). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<4, (18, 9, 5)>, <4, (18, 9, 16)>, <4, (18, 5, 16)>, <4, (9, 5, 16)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6, 12, 16). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<18, (4, 6, 12)>, <18, (4, 6, 16)>, <18, (4, 12, 16)>, <18, (6, 12, 16)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (15, 13, 9, 0). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<1, (15, 13, 9)>, <1, (15, 13, 0)>, <1, (15, 9, 0)>, <1, (13, 9, 0)>

Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (1, 17, 19, 0). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<13, (1, 17, 19)>, <13, (1, 17, 0)>, <13, (1, 19, 0)>, <13, (17, 19, 0)>

Node 17 has 4 neighbors: (13, 6, 5, 7). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<17, (13, 6, 5)>, <17, (13, 6, 7)>, <17, (13, 5, 7)>, <17, (6, 5, 7)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (17, 16, 3, 6). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<7, (17, 16, 3)>, <7, (17, 16, 6)>, <7, (17, 3, 6)>, <7, (16, 3, 6)>

Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (18, 11, 19, 10). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<12, (18, 11, 19)>, <12, (18, 11, 10)>, <12, (18, 19, 10)>, <12, (11, 19, 10)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (4, 17, 11). So, it forms 1 3-star.
<5, (4, 17, 11)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (18, 17, 7, 2). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<6, (18, 17, 7)>, <6, (18, 17, 2)>, <6, (18, 7, 2)>, <6, (17, 7, 2)>

Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (13, 2, 12). So, it forms 1 3-star.
<19, (13, 2, 12)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (14, 3, 6, 19). So, it can form [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<2, (14, 3, 6)>, <2, (14, 3, 19)>, <2, (14, 6, 19)>, <2, (3, 6, 19)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 34. 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
