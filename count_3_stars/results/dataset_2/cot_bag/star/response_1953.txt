Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

We need to check each node to see how many 3-stars are formed around it. 

Starting with node 0: It has 2 neighbors (6, 4, but not 7)
Moving to node 1: It has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 6, 3, 2)
Node 2: Has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 1, 4)
Node 3: Has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 1, 7, 8)
Node 4: Has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 2, 0)
Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (8, 1, 4, 3)
Node 6: Has 5 neighbors (9, 1, 2, 8, 0)
Node 7: Has 2 neighbors (3, 8, but not 0)
Node 8: Has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 3, 4, 7)
Node 9: Has 4 neighbors (6, 2, 1, 3)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
