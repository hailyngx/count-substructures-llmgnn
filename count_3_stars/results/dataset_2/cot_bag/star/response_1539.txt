Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 16) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <0, (3, 7, 16)>, <0, (3, 16, 19)>, <0, (3, 7, 19)>, <0, (7, 16, 19)>
  
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <1, (3, 10, 18)>, <1, (3, 10, 1)>, <1, (10, 18, 1)>, <1, (10, 18, 8)>
  
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <2, (12, 13, 11)>, <2, (12, 13, 2)>, <2, (13, 11, 2)>, <2, (13, 11, 19)>
  
- Node 3: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
  <3, (0, 1, 15)>
  
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
  
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <6, (3, 13, 15)>, <6, (3, 13, 6)>, <6, (13, 15, 6)>, <6, (13, 15, 2)>
  
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <8, (5, 9, 18)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (9, 18, 8)>, <8, (9, 14, 16)>
  
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <10, (1, 13, 19)>, <10, (1, 13, 10)>, <10, (13, 19, 10)>, <10, (13, 19, 15)>
  
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <11, (2, 13, 19)>, <11, (2, 13, 11)>, <11, (13, 19, 11)>, <11, (13, 19, 15)>
  
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <12, (2, 13, 17)>, <12, (2, 13, 12)>, <12, (13, 17, 12)>, <12, (13, 17, 3)>
  
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <13, (6, 10, 12)>, <13, (6, 10, 13)>, <13, (10, 12, 13)>, <13, (10, 12, 19)>
  
- Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <15, (3, 10, 17)>, <15, (3, 10, 15)>, <15, (10, 17, 15)>, <15, (10, 17, 19)>
  
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <17, (12, 15, 19)>, <17, (12, 15, 17)>, <17, (15, 19, 17)>, <17, (15, 19, 7)>
  
- Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
  <19, (0, 16, 19)>, <19, (0, 16, 14)>, <19, (16, 14, 19)>, <19, (16, 14, 9)>, <19, (16, 14, 10)>, <19, (16, 14, 13)>, <19, (16, 14, 3)>, <19, (16, 14, 6)>, <19, (16, 14, 1)>, <19, (16, 14, 12)>

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 55

Therefore, the final answer is [55].
