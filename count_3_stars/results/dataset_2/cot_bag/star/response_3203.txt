Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can start by identifying the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. These nodes are 5, 9, 10, 11, and 4. Node 5 has degree 5, node 9 has degree 5, nodes 10 and 11 have degree 5, and node 4 has degree 5.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<10, (6, 11, 7)>
<11, (5, 10, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 12)>
