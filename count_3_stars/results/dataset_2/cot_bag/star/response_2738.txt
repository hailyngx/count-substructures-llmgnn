Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (10, 9) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 6, node 5, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 6: 
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 11, 0
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 11)>, <6, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (7, 5, 11)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <6, (11, 5, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 11)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (1, 11, 0)>, <6, (7, 11, 0)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 6, 12, 4, 3, 7, 14
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- <5, (6, 12, 4)>, <5, (6, 12, 3)>, <5, (6, 12, 7)>, <5, (6, 12, 14)>, <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 14)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 14)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (12, 4, 3)>, <5, (12, 4, 7)>, <5, (12, 4, 14)>, <5, (12, 3, 7)>, <5, (12, 3, 14)>, <5, (12, 7, 14)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 14)>, <5, (4, 7, 14)>, <5, (3, 7, 14)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 10, 1, 13, 0
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <9, (2, 10, 1)>, <9, (2, 10, 13)>, <9, (2, 10, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 13)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 13, 0)>, <9, (10, 1, 13)>, <9, (10, 1, 0)>, <9, (10, 13, 0)>, <9, (1, 13, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we have a total of [10 + 20 + 10] = 40 3-stars in this graph.
