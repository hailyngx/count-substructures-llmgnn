Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 13) (1, 18) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 19) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 26) (28, 4) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 14) (17, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 29) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 13) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 7) (7, 23) (7, 27) (7, 26) (14, 15) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 5) (26, 4) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (10, 8) (10, 26) (19, 23) (19, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 19) (6, 18) (20, 16) (20, 1) (18, 1) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 12) (0, 22) (0, 21) (21, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 23, 26, 27, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-star structures are: 
<1, (3, 13, 20)>, 
<4, (8, 9, 29)>, 
<9, (4, 14, 15)>, 
<11, (12, 25, 27)>, 
<14, (5, 14, 26)>, 
<15, (3, 9, 14)>, 
<16, (2, 11, 20)>, 
<18, (1, 18, 23)>, 
<23, (6, 19, 23)>, 
<26, (6, 14, 26)>, 
<27, (7, 11, 22)>, 
<29, (4, 14, 29)>.
