Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
