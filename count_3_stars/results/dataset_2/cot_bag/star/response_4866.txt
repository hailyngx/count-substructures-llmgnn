Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 0, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 8, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 57 3-stars [, [57]].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <9, (5, 2, 6)>
- <9, (5, 2, 4)>
- <9, (5, 2, 1)>
- <9, (5, 3, 1)>
- <9, (4, 1, 7)>
- <9, (4, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 8, 0)>
- <3, (5, 2, 0)>
- <3, (4, 8, 0)>
- <3, (4, 2, 0)>
- <3, (8, 2, 0)>
- <0, (6, 8, 3)>
- <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- <0, (6, 3, 2)>
- <2, (9, 5, 3)>
- <2, (9, 5, 0)>
- <2, (9, 3, 0)>
- <2, (5, 3, 0)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
