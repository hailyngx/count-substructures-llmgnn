Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
(0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
(1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) 
(2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14)
(3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
(4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1)
(5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7)
(6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7)
(7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) 
(8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3)
(9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1)
(10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13)
(11, 10) (11, 6)
(12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9)
(13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5)
(14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12)

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with the number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 6 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = [10 Choose 3] = [120]

Listing unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 12, 14)>
<2, (3, 8, 13)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 11)>
<12, (0, 9, 14)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [120], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (9, 12, 14)>, <2, (3, 8, 13)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 11)>, and <12, (0, 9, 14)>.
