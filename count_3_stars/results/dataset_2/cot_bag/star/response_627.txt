Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

From the given graph, we see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
Node 0 has neighbors 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Since node 0 has exactly 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 1: 
Node 1 has neighbors 0, 6, 7, and 9. Since node 1 has exactly 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2: 
Node 2 has neighbors 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Since node 2 has exactly 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4: 
Node 4 has neighbors 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Since node 4 has exactly 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6: 
Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9. Since node 6 has exactly 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 8: 
Node 8 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Since node 8 has exactly 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 9: 
Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, and 6. Since node 9 has exactly 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding all the 3-stars calculated above, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
