Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 25 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
2. For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
3. For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
4. For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
5. For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
6. For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
7. For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
8. For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 56 3-stars. So, the final answer is [56].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
