Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 53 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
