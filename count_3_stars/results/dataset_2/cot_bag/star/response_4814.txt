Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 9) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 13) 

Response:
In this graph, we can see that node 9, 2, 18, 14, 0, 1, 17, 4, 12, 6, 3, 5, and 10 each have at least three neighbors, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
