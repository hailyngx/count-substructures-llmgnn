Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the given edges can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8

Let's determine the 3-stars and calculate their total number:

For node 1:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 2:
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 3:
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 5:
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
