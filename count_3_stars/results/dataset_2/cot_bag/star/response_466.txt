Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 21) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 14) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 12) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 4) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 18) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (1, 27) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 26) (7, 20) (7, 0) (5, 11) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 6) (9, 11) (9, 23) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 29) (16, 22) (16, 24) (16, 29) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 29) (23, 9) (23, 26) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 6) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 16) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (14, 13) (14, 19) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 26) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 25, 10, 11, 8, 13, 17, 18, 22, 20, 4, 21, 28, 0, 7, 27, 12, 23, 26, and 24.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 57

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, 2, 4, 10>, <3, 2, 25, 21>, <3, 4, 10, 11>, <3, 25, 19, 21>, <3, 10, 11, 17>, <25, 19, 21, 28>, <25, 21, 28, 27>, <10, 11, 17, 12>, <11, 5, 6, 19>, <8, 13, 14, 19>, <13, 8, 21, 25>, <17, 24, 18, 22>, <18, 4, 20, 21>, <22, 18, 28, 21>, <20, 15, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 25, 21>, <21, 13, 14, 19>, <28, 21, 27, 1>, <0, 15, 20, 7>, <7, 0, 26, 20>, <27, 1, 28, 29>, <12, 17, 24, 18>, <23, 9, 11, 5>, <26, 0, 7, 20>, <24, 8, 13, 14>, <29, 12, 17, 24>, <16, 22, 18, 28>, <6, 11, 5, 19>.
