Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 3) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 5, 8, 0, 14, 3, 11, 6, 1, 9, 13, and 10. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars for these nodes: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 101 \)

So, there are 101 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely:

\[ [101] \]

<5, (9, 2, 13)>
<5, (4, 8, 3)>
<5, (0, 14, 3)>
<5, (3, 8, 11)>
<14, (8, 6, 13)>
<14, (0, 11, 7)>
<14, (3, 13, 10)>
<14, (6, 1, 2)>
