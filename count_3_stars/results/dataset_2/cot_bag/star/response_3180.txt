Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 20) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 8) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 25) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 24) (5, 24) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 6) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 9) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 25) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 9) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 2) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 24) (25, 19) (25, 4) (25, 12) (12, 14) (12, 25) (29, 11) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are the following nodes with the number of neighbors they have:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 2 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 20: 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 2 neighbors
- Node 23: 1 neighbor
- Node 24: 5 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 4 neighbors
- Node 29: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, and 28 each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, 3, 4, 8, and 14 each can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 15 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot 1 = 65 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [65].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<2, (6, 17, 19)>, <6, (2, 18, 7)>, <7, (6, 3, 9)>, <9, (7, 1, 27)>, <10, (11, 14, 0)>, <11, (10, 28, 13)>, <13, (11, 4, 27)>, <16, (26, 6, 28)>, <17, (2, 0, 21)>, <18, (6, 13, 19)>, <19, (18, 25, 26)>, <20, (21, 11, 7)>, <26, (16, 19, 28)>, <27, (9, 13, 27)>, <28, (26, 16, 24)>, <1, (8, 9, 27)>, <3, (7, 9, 24)>, <4, (13, 25, 22)>, <8, (1, 26, 8)>, <14, (10, 24, 12)>
