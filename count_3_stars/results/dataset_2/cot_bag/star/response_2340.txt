Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 1, 7
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 2, 3, 7
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 3, 9
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 3, 5
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 1, 5, 6, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned earlier:

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
