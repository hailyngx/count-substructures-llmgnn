Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: degree = 5. It has 5 neighbors. 
2. Node 1: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
3. Node 2: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
4. Node 3: degree = 2. It has 2 neighbors.
5. Node 4: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
6. Node 5: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
7. Node 6: degree = 5. It has 5 neighbors. 
8. Node 7: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
9. Node 8: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
10. Node 9: degree = 5. It has 5 neighbors. 
11. Node 10: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
12. Node 11: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
13. Node 12: degree = 4. It has 4 neighbors. 
14. Node 13: degree = 3. It has 3 neighbors.
15. Node 14: degree = 3. It has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 10: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 11: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 14)>, <1, (5, 11, 12)>, <2, (0, 9, 10)>, <3, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 11)>, <6, (2, 11, 13)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (7, 9, 12)>, <9, (4, 5, 0)>, <10, (2, 13, 14)>, <11, (5, 6, 12)>, <12, (1, 8, 11)>, <13, (6, 10, 2)>, <14, (0, 10, 12)>
