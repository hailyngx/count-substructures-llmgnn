Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 16) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 7) (3, 11) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 8) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 17) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 16) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 17) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (0, 8) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <2, (6, 10, 11)>, <2, (10, 11, 12)>, <2, (6, 11, 15)>, <2, (6, 11, 19)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <4, (5, 10, 12)>, <4, (5, 12, 16)>, <4, (10, 12, 16)>, <4, (10, 12, 17)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <6, (2, 15, 19)>, <6, (10, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (6, 15, 19)>

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars are: <8, (1, 10, 11)>, <8, (1, 10, 14)>, <8, (1, 10, 8)>, <8, (1, 11, 14)>, <8, (1, 11, 8)>, <8, (10, 11, 14)>, <8, (10, 11, 7)>, <8, (10, 14, 7)>, <8, (11, 14, 7)>, <8, (8, 10, 11)>

For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars are: <10, (2, 4, 12)>, <10, (2, 8, 11)>, <10, (4, 8, 12)>, <10, (8, 11, 14)>, <10, (8, 11, 7)>, <10, (8, 14, 7)>, <10, (11, 14, 7)>, <10, (2, 11, 12)>, <10, (4, 11, 12)>, <10, (12, 17, 19)>

For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars are: <11, (1, 15, 19)>, <11, (2, 6, 15)>, <11, (2, 6, 19)>, <11, (2, 15, 19)>, <11, (6, 15, 19)>, <11, (1, 6, 15)>, <11, (1, 6, 19)>, <11, (1, 2, 6)>, <11, (1, 15, 16)>, <11, (1, 15, 18)>

For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The 3-stars are: <12, (2, 4, 10)>, <12, (4, 10, 16)>, <12, (4, 12, 17)>, <12, (4, 12, 19)>, <12, (10, 17, 19)>, <12, (2, 10, 11)>, <12, (2, 11, 4)>, <12, (2, 11, 17)>, <12, (2, 11, 19)>, <12, (10, 11, 17)>

For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <15, (6, 11, 19)>, <15, (6, 15, 16)>, <15, (6, 16, 19)>, <15, (11, 16, 19)>

For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <16, (4, 5, 15)>, <16, (4, 15, 18)>, <16, (5, 15, 18)>, <16, (15, 18, 19)>

For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The 3-stars are: <17, (7, 12, 19)>, <17, (7, 17, 12)>, <17, (9, 12, 17)>, <17, (12, 19, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (6, 10, 11)>, <2, (10, 11, 12)>, <2, (6, 11, 15)>, <2, (6, 11, 19)>, <4, (5, 10, 12)>, <4, (5, 12, 16)>, <4, (10, 12, 16)>, <4, (10, 12, 17)>, <6, (2, 15, 19)>, <6, (10, 15, 19)>, <6, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (6, 15, 19)>, <8, (1, 10, 11)>, <8, (1, 10, 14)>, <8, (1, 10, 8)>, <8, (1, 11, 14)>, <8, (1, 11, 8)>, <8, (10, 11, 14)>, <8, (10, 11, 7)>, <8, (10, 14, 7)>, <8, (11, 14, 7)>, <8, (8, 10, 11)>, <10, (2, 4, 12)>, <10, (2, 8, 11)>, <10, (4, 8, 12)>, <10, (8, 11, 14)>, <10, (8, 11, 7)>, <10, (8, 14, 7)>, <10, (11, 14, 7)>, <10, (2, 11, 12)>, <10, (4, 11, 12)>, <10, (12, 17, 19)>, <11, (1, 15, 19)>, <11, (2, 6, 15)>, <11, (2, 6, 19)>, <11, (2, 15, 19)>, <11, (6, 15, 19)>, <11, (1, 6, 15)>, <11, (1, 6, 19)>, <11, (1, 2, 6)>, <11, (1, 15, 16)>, <11, (1, 15, 18)>, <12, (2, 4, 10)>, <12, (4, 10, 16)>, <12, (4, 12, 17)>, <12, (4, 12, 19)>, <12, (10, 17, 19)>, <12, (2, 10, 11)>, <12, (2, 11, 4)>, <12, (2, 11, 17)>, <12, (2, 11, 19)>, <12, (10, 11, 17)>, <15, (6, 11, 19)>, <15, (6, 15, 16)>, <15, (6, 16, 19)>, <15, (11, 16, 19)>, <16, (4, 5, 15)>, <16, (4, 15, 18)>, <16, (5, 15, 18)>, <16, (15, 18, 19)>, <17, (7, 12, 19)>, <17, (7, 17, 12)>, <17, (9, 12, 17)>, <17, (12, 19, 7)>
