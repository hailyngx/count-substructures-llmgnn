Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 1 neighbor
- Node 11: 6 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 

For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
For Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 74

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [74].

Now, listing unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 11)>
<0, (3, 8, 13)>
<0, (8, 11, 2)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 11)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (8, 13, 4)>
<4, (6, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 11, 13)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<8, (0, 3, 13)>
<9, (5, 11, 13)>
<10, (8, 11, 0)>
