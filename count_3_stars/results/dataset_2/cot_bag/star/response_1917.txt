Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4, 8, 2, 5
Node 1: 6, 2, 4, 7
Node 2: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5
Node 3: 6, 4
Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 0
Node 5: 0, 7, 2
Node 6: 1, 7, 3, 2, 8
Node 7: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5
Node 8: 6, 9, 4, 0
Node 9: 8, 7, 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [*1* 3-star]
Node 1: [*1* 3-star]
Node 2: [*1* 3-star]
Node 4: [*1* 3-star]
Node 6: [^5^ 3-stars]
Node 7: [*1* 3-star]
Node 8: [*1* 3-star]
Node 9: [*1* 3-star]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives [14].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 8, 4>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 2, 0>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 6>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 3, 4>
<7, 9, 8>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 9, 7>
<9, 8, 6>
