Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

For node 0, we have 4 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

For node 1, we have 4 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

For node 2, we have 5 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.

For node 3, we have 5 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.

For node 4, we have 3 neighbors which is exactly 3, so we have 1 3-star.

For node 5, we have 5 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.

For node 6, we have 4 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

For node 7, we have only 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

For node 8, we have 4 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

For node 9, we have 4 neighbors which is enough to form 3-stars. So, we have C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the final count of unique 3-stars is [47]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, 3, 5, 9>
<0, 3, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
