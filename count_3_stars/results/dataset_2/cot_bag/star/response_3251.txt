Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 2) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 21) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (13, 26) (13, 20) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 20) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 19) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 21) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 22) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 28) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (11, 20) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 1) (23, 28) (6, 14) (1, 18) (1, 23) (29, 21) (29, 12) (27, 22) (27, 16) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 24) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 28) (28, 2) (28, 23) (28, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29. 

Now, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get:
4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 49

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 21, 7)>, <0, (21, 0, 15)>, <0, (21, 11, 7)>, <0, (21, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 0, 21)>, <2, (22, 2, 5)>, <2, (22, 5, 7)>, <2, (22, 27, 16)>, <5, (0, 21, 7)>, <5, (2, 22, 7)>, <5, (20, 11, 2)>, <5, (20, 13, 2)>, <10, (17, 4, 16)>, <10, (17, 10, 16)>, <10, (4, 10, 17)>, <10, (16, 27, 12)>, <11, (21, 11, 14)>, <11, (18, 23, 1)>, <11, (18, 11, 12)>, <11, (14, 11, 6)>, <12, (28, 12, 2)>, <12, (28, 12, 25)>, <12, (25, 16, 27)>, <12, (29, 12, 25)>, <13, (20, 5, 2)>, <14, (11, 14, 6)>, <14, (14, 7, 22)>, <17, (10, 4, 16)>, <18, (24, 18, 23)>, <18, (23, 18, 1)>, <18, (23, 1, 18)>, <18, (11, 18, 24)>, <19, (24, 19, 17)>, <19, (9, 19, 17)>, <19, (9, 19, 24)>, <19, (17, 19, 24)>, <20, (11, 20, 13)>, <21, (0, 21, 11)>, <21, (0, 21, 3)>, <21, (17, 21, 3)>, <21, (3, 21, 17)>, <22, (3, 22, 27)>, <22, (2, 22, 27)>, <23, (1, 18, 23)>, <23, (23, 1, 18)>, <23, (18, 23, 1)>, <23, (18, 23, 28)>, <24, (26, 24, 19)>, <24, (19, 24, 18)>, <24, (18, 24, 26)>, <24, (24, 26, 13)>, <26, (13, 26, 20)>, <27, (16, 27, 12)>, <28, (23, 28, 12)>, <28, (12, 28, 2)>.
