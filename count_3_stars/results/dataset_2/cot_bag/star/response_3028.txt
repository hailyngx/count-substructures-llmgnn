Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 6, 4, 7, 8, 5, and 1. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (4, 1, 3)>
