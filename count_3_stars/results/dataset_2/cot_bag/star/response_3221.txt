Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 9, 6, 1, 11, 2, 8, 0, 12, 5, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 129.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [129].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 12)>
<1, (4, 7, 14)>
<11, (10, 13, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 14)>
<8, (7, 6, 5)>
<0, (9, 11, 3)>
<5, (4, 10, 8)>
<13, (7, 11, 12)>
<14, (11, 2, 1)>
