Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 6, 2, 8, 3
- Node 1: 4, 7, 6, 9
- Node 2: 7, 9, 5, 0
- Node 3: 5, 0
- Node 4: 7, 0, 1
- Node 5: 6, 2, 3
- Node 6: 9, 5, 1, 8, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 9, 2, 1
- Node 8: 6, 9, 0
- Node 9: 7, 6, 8, 2, 1

Considering the number of neighbors each node has, we find that the 3-stars are formed with nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

So, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- <0, (4, 1, 6)>
- <0, (7, 6, 9)>
- <0, (7, 6, 5)>
- <0, (7, 6, 8)>
- <0, (6, 9, 8)>
- <0, (6, 1, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 3)>
- <1, (4, 7, 6)>
- <1, (7, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 9, 8)>
- <2, (7, 6, 5)>
- <2, (7, 9, 5)>
- <6, (9, 5, 3)>
- <7, (4, 1, 6)>
- <7, (4, 1, 9)>
- <7, (4, 1, 2)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 9, 8)>
- <9, (6, 5, 3)>
- <9, (6, 1, 8)>
