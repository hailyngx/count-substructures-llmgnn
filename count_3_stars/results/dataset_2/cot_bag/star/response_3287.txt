Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (9, 6, 8, 1, 3)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 3, 7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (5, 9, 2, 4)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (5, 3, 4, 0, 7)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (5, 9, 1, 0, 2)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (6, 1, 8, 2)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (5, 4)
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (6, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 0, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node based on its degree:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center
- Node 0: 1 3-star with node 0 as the center
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center

Adding all these up:

\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (9, 1, 3)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 9, 4)>
- <1, (5, 3, 0)>
- <3, (5, 9, 2)>
- <4, (6, 1, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (6, 3, 7)>
- <7, (9, 1, 2)>
