Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 17) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 10) (14, 7) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3
Node 1: 0, 10, 18
Node 2: 7, 10, 16
Node 3: 0, 7, 16
Node 4: 6, 17
Node 5: 9, 13
Node 6: 4, 7, 13, 19
Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 14, 17
Node 8: 18
Node 9: 5, 15, 19
Node 10: 1, 2, 14
Node 11: 12, 13
Node 12: 11, 16
Node 13: 5, 6, 11, 15
Node 14: 7, 10
Node 15: 9, 13, 18, 19
Node 16: 2, 3, 12, 19
Node 17: 4, 7, 19
Node 18: 1, 8, 15
Node 19: 6, 9, 15, 16, 17

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 31

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31]. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 18, 15)>
<2, (7, 10, 14)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 17, 19)>
<7, (6, 13, 19)>
<10, (1, 16, 18)>
<13, (5, 6, 15)>
<13, (11, 12, 15)>
<15, (9, 13, 19)>
<15, (18, 16, 19)>
<16, (2, 3, 19)>
<16, (12, 19, 17)>
<16, (3, 7, 19)>
<17, (4, 7, 19)>
<19, (6, 13, 15)>
<19, (16, 17, 6)>
<19, (17, 4, 7)>
<19, (9, 15, 13)>
<19, (15, 16, 18)>
