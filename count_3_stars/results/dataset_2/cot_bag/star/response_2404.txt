Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 14) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them along with the number of neighbors for each:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 6 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 8 neighbors
Node 10: 5 neighbors
Node 12: 4 neighbors
Node 13: 4 neighbors
Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 56 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 132 \)

Therefore, there are 132 3-stars in total in this graph. This final number goes inside brackets: [132].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 13)>
<2, (1, 6, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<6, (0, 10, 13)>
<8, (3, 4, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<10, (1, 6, 0)>
<13, (3, 4, 6)>
<14, (1, 3, 8)>
