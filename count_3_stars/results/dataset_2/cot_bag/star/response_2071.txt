Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14.
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
Node 12: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 

Total number of 3-stars formed: \(20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 93\)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \([93]\).
And the unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 14)>, <1, (2, 8, 14)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 12)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (5, 7, 12)>, <1, (9, 12, 14)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 13, 14)>, <2, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (9, 12, 14)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 12)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 14)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <5, (4, 7, 12)>, <6, (9, 12, 14)>
