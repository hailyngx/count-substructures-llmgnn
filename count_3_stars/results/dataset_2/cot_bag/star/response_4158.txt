Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 10, 14
- Node 1: 0, 8, 12, 13
- Node 2: 3, 8, 12
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 10, 11
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9, 10, 12
- Node 6: 4, 11, 13
- Node 7: 4, 10, 12, 14
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9, 2
- Node 9: 5, 8, 11
- Node 10: 0, 3, 5, 7, 12
- Node 11: 3, 6, 9
- Node 12: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10
- Node 13: 1, 4, 6
- Node 14: 0, 4, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of 76 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [76].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <0, 10, 12>
- <0, 1, 10>
- <1, 8, 13>
- <1, 8, 12>
- <1, 12, 10>
- <3, 10, 11>
- <3, 4, 13>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <4, 6, 11>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 7, 14>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <5, 9, 10>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <8, 9, 11>
- <8, 9, 4>
- <10, 7, 14>
- <10, 7, 12>
- <10, 3, 11>
- <10, 3, 5>
