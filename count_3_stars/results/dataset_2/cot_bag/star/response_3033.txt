Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 29) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 27) (6, 15) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 25) (12, 7) (12, 27) (12, 1) (12, 8) (27, 7) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 18) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 24) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 25) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 19) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 19) (3, 21) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (21, 0) (21, 3) (21, 20) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 18) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 24) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 20) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 28) (16, 22) (23, 10) (28, 10) (28, 17) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 1) (20, 21) (20, 13) (22, 11) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 1) (25, 11) (25, 2) (25, 13) (25, 15) (18, 11) (18, 27) (18, 3) (18, 29) (18, 15) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 22) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 25) (15, 18) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have at least 3 neighbors are: 1, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Now let's find the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
2. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
11. Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the totals: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 50.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (12, 5, 14)>, <10, (11, 15, 14)>, <10, (11, 25, 13)>, <10, (11, 27, 18)>, <10, (11, 25, 15)>, <10, (11, 27, 18)>, <10, (14, 24, 19)>, <11, (10, 15, 14)>, <11, (10, 25, 13)>, <11, (10, 27, 18)>, <11, (10, 25, 15)>, <11, (10, 27, 18)>, <12, (1, 5, 22)>, <18, (11, 27, 29)>, <22, (11, 1, 26)>, <24, (14, 19, 26)>, <25, (11, 13, 15)>, <25, (11, 13, 20)>, <25, (11, 15, 18)>, <25, (11, 18, 27)>
