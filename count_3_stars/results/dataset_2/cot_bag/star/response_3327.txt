Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 15) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (15, 16) (15, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (19, 11) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 19) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 8) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors and the number of 3-stars they form are:

- Node 3 (with 5 neighbors) can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 (with 6 neighbors) can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 (with 4 neighbors) can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] in the graph is 55.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (8, 10, 19)>
<3, (12, 13, 19)>
<6, (7, 9, 11)>
<8, (3, 10, 12)>
<9, (0, 6, 12)>
<10, (0, 5, 18)>
<11, (6, 7, 19)>
<12, (9, 14, 19)>
<13, (1, 3, 19)>
<14, (4, 12, 18)>
<16, (2, 15, 16)>
<18, (8, 14, 18)>
