Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 22) (1, 12) (21, 13) (21, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 19) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 23) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 3) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 18) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 10) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 10) (20, 18) (10, 16) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 10) (24, 22) (24, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \]

\[ = 65 \]

So, there are 65 3-stars in the given graph. 

\[ [65] \] 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

\[ 
<0, (3, 15, 5)>
<3, (0, 28, 26)>
<4, (1, 14, 15)>
<5, (6, 15, 8)>
<6, (14, 22, 8)>
<11, (0, 4, 13)>
<12, (1, 17, 27)>
<13, (0, 2, 11)>
<14, (4, 17, 28)>
<15, (0, 4, 24)>
<16, (17, 29, 10)>
<17, (14, 12, 19)>
<18, (3, 19, 20)>
<19, (18, 27, 17)>
<22, (1, 23, 24)>
<28, (3, 29, 11)>
<29, (21, 16, 28)>
<4, (10, 14, 11)>
<13, (2, 10, 21)>
<10, (4, 16, 7)>
