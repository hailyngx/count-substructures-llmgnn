Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these results: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 11, 13)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <8, (9, 10, 13)>, <9, (0, 10, 5)>, <10, (1, 4, 8)>, <11, (0, 6, 13)>, <12, (3, 4, 5)>, <13, (0, 6, 11)>, <14, (2, 3, 6)>
