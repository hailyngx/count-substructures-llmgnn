Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars. Let's identify such nodes:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 6 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: No 3-star is formed.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars per node.
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node.
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars per node.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 (4 3-stars)
- Node 2 (4 3-stars)
- Node 4 (10 3-stars)
- Node 8 (10 3-stars)
- Node 9 (10 3-stars)
- Node 10 (20 3-stars)
- Node 12 (10 3-stars)
- Node 13 (4 3-stars)
- Node 14 (10 3-stars)

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 82

Putting the final number inside brackets: [82]
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (11, 4, 0)>
- <2, (11, 1, 12)>
- <4, (0, 10, 6)>
- <8, (9, 10, 14)>
- <9, (8, 14, 13)>
- <10, (0, 11, 3)>
- <12, (4, 6, 2)>
- <13, (9, 10, 7)>
- <14, (0, 5, 7)>
