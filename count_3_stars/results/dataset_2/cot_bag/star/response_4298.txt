Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (0, 19) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 5) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 19) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 4, 16, 14, 3, 15, 18, 12, 13, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
10 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 16) + 4 (from node 14) + 1 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 15) + 1 (from node 18) + 1 (from node 12) + 1 (from node 13) + 4 (from node 9) = 37

Thus, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 8, 15)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)>
<5, (12, 15, 19)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 15)>
<16, (2, 3, 19)>
<16, (3, 17, 19)>
<16, (2, 3, 17)>
<16, (2, 17, 19)>
<16, (3, 16, 17)>
<16, (2, 16, 17)>
<16, (3, 16, 19)>
<16, (16, 17, 19)>
<14, (9, 11, 15)>
<14, (9, 11, 19)>
<14, (9, 15, 19)>
<14, (11, 15, 19)>
<9, (7, 11, 14)>
<9, (7, 11, 19)>
<9, (7, 14, 19)>
