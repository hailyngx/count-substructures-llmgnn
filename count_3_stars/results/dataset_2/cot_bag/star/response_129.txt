Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 49

So, there are 49 total 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets [], we have: [49]

And the unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (7, 4, 9)>, <1, (7, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 8, 5)>, <1, (9, 8, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 8)>, <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 2, 7)>, <4, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>
