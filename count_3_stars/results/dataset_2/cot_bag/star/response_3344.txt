Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 9, 15)>, <1, (0, 12, 13)>, <1, (9, 12, 13)>, <1, (13, 15, 2)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 10)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 11)>, <5, (3, 6, 17)>, <5, (3, 6, 10)>, <5, (6, 10, 4)>, <5, (6, 10, 17)>, <5, (6, 10, 17)>, <5, (3, 17, 6)>, <5, (6, 11, 17)>, <5, (11, 16, 12)>, <5, (11, 12, 19)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 17)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 17)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 17)>
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <12, (0, 1, 8)>, <12, (0, 1, 19)>, <12, (1, 8, 19)>, <12, (8, 11, 19)>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars: <13, (1, 2, 15)>, <13, (1, 2, 16)>, <13, (2, 15, 16)>, <13, (15, 16, 1)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <15, (1, 13, 14)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <17, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [27].
