Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:  
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<0, (1, 2, 4)>  
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<0, (1, 3, 6)>  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  
<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<0, (3, 6, 9)>  
<3, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<3, (7, 8, 9)>  
<5, (1, 2, 9)>  
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
