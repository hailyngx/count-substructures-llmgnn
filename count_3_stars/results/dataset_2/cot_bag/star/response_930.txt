Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 8, 13, 10, 17, 2, 18, 0, 14, 1, 15, 19, 3, 16, 7, 5, 11.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\( 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (2, 8, 11)>
<9, (1, 14, 16)>
<13, (0, 8, 11)>
<10, (7, 12, 17)>
<17, (2, 7, 19)>
<2, (6, 11, 17)>
<18, (11, 15, 19)>
<14, (6, 7, 16)>
<15, (5, 7, 18)>
<19, (3, 17, 18)>
<3, (0, 4, 19)>
<16, (5, 9, 14)>
<7, (5, 10, 14)>
<5, (7, 11, 15)>
<11, (5, 7, 13)>
