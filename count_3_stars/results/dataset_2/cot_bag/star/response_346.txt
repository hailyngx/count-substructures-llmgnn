Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (16, 11) (16, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 28) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 1) (23, 12) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 28) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 19) (12, 7) (12, 23) (12, 29) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 26) (18, 0) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 14) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (17, 19) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 21) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 13) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 9) (24, 21) (29, 12) (29, 6) (5, 22) (5, 23) (8, 20) (8, 12) (6, 22) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 25) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 24) (9, 17) (9, 28) (9, 14) (25, 22) (25, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: Neighbors (4, 23, 20, 13, 15)
- Node 2: Neighbors (10, 26)
- Node 3: Neighbors (0, 27, 13)
- Node 4: Neighbors (7, 1)
- Node 6: Neighbors (22, 13, 29, 25)
- Node 7: Neighbors (4, 12, 28)
- Node 9: Neighbors (17, 28, 14)
- Node 10: Neighbors (11, 26, 2, 28)
- Node 12: Neighbors (7, 23, 29, 8)
- Node 13: Neighbors (16, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 14: Neighbors (19, 15, 9)
- Node 15: Neighbors (1, 14, 21)
- Node 17: Neighbors (19, 26, 21, 9)
- Node 19: Neighbors (20, 17, 14)
- Node 20: Neighbors (0, 27, 1, 8, 19)
- Node 21: Neighbors (15, 17, 24)
- Node 22: Neighbors (23, 6, 5, 25)
- Node 23: Neighbors (22, 5, 1, 12)
- Node 26: Neighbors (10, 2, 17)
- Node 28: Neighbors (7, 10, 9)
- Node 29: Neighbors (12, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 50 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
