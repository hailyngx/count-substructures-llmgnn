Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 25) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 25) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (20, 3) (20, 7) (20, 22) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 13) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 29) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 5) (24, 3) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 10) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 23) (23, 2) (23, 0) (23, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 28) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with more than three neighbors: node 1 has 4 neighbors, node 3 has 4 neighbors, and node 21 has 5 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 \)

So, there are 18 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets: [18].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (7, 13, 17)>, 
<1, (7, 13, 21)>, 
<1, (7, 17, 21)>, 
<1, (13, 17, 21)>, 
<3, (10, 15, 24)>, 
<3, (10, 15, 20)>, 
<3, (10, 15, 3)>, 
<3, (15, 18, 10)>, 
<21, (25, 26, 28)>, 
<21, (25, 26, 21)>, 
<21, (25, 28, 21)>, 
<21, (26, 28, 21)>, 
<21, (25, 28, 26)>, 
<1, (7, 17, 21)>, 
<1, (13, 17, 21)>, 
<1, (7, 13, 17)>, 
<1, (1, 7, 21)>, 
<1, (7, 13, 21)>
