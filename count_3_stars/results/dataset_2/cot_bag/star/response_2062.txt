Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (7, 2) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 28) (21, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 25) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 17) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 0) (20, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 1) (22, 6) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 17) (3, 9) (3, 13) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 12) (15, 23) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 27) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 28) (5, 29) (5, 18) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 16) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 17) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, and 28.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (29, 18, 19, 20, 7), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (2, 21, 4, 10, 28), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (6, 14, 3, 23), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 24, 28), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (2, 29, 23, 25), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (2, 0, 29, 1), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors (0, 18, 12), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors (8, 26, 19), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors (6, 25, 17, 26), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors (7, 18, 13, 27), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42 \]

So, there are 42 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (7, 19, 29)>, <7, (2, 10, 28)>, <9, (3, 14, 23)>, <18, (5, 24, 28)>, <19, (2, 23, 25)>, <20, (0, 1, 29)>, <24, (0, 12, 18)>, <25, (8, 19, 26)>, <26, (6, 17, 25)>, and <28, (13, 18, 27)>.
