Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's analyze each node's neighbors to determine the 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: Neighbors - 6, 9, 3, 8, 5, 2, Total: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: Neighbors - 6, 8, 7, Total: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Neighbors - 9, 3, 4, 7, 0, Total: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: Neighbors - 9, 0, 4, 2, Total: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: Neighbors - 3, 8, 5, 2, Total: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: Neighbors - 6, 4, 0, Total: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Neighbors - 5, 1, 0, Total: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: Neighbors - 1, 2, 8, Total: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Neighbors - 9, 1, 4, 7, 0, Total: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: Neighbors - 8, 2, 3, 0, Total: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 44 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 5)>
- <0, (2, 8, 4)>
- <0, (2, 8, 1)>
- <0, (2, 5, 4)>
- <2, (8, 9, 3)>
