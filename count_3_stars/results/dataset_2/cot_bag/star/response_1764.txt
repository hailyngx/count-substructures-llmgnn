Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by that node:
- Node 1 has only 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get [4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1] = 77.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [77]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 10)>, <4, (7, 10, 13)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (9, 11, 13)>, <7, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 8, 13)>, <9, (0, 7, 10)>, <9, (1, 7, 11)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 10, 12)>, <10, (12, 13, 14)>, <11, (7, 9, 13)>, <12, (1, 5, 6)>, <13, (10, 11, 14)>.
