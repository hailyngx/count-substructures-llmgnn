Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4 has 5 neighbors (nodes 9, 5, 1, 3, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 5 has 6 neighbors (nodes 4, 7, 6, 2, 8, 3). So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 6 has 6 neighbors (nodes 7, 5, 1, 2, 8, 0). So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 6, 9, 5, 2, 0). So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (7, 5, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (6, 5, 0)>
