Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 8, 13, 5, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (13, 14, 1)>
  - <8, (13, 0, 6)>
  - <8, (13, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (13, 7, 0)>
  - <8, (13, 7, 10)>
  - <8, (13, 0, 9)>
  - <8, (13, 0, 4)>
  - <8, (13, 0, 5)>
  - <8, (13, 7, 10)>
  - <8, (13, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (13, 1, 9)>
  - <8, (13, 1, 14)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 12)>
  - <8, (14, 12, 3)>
  - <8, (14, 12, 6)>
  - <8, (14, 12, 0)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 9)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 13)>
  - <8, (14, 1, 4)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <13, (8, 14, 1)>
  - <13, (8, 14, 12)>
  - <13, (8, 14, 1)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 4)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 9)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 14)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 4)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 9)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 14)>
  - <13, (8, 1, 4)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (8, 6, 0)>
  - <5, (8, 6, 2)>
  - <5, (8, 6, 4)>
  - <5, (8, 6, 5)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (11, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (11, 5, 0)>
  - <4, (11, 5, 1)>
  - <4, (11, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (11, 9, 1)>
  - <4, (11, 9, 0)>
  - <4, (11, 9, 8)>
  - <4, (11, 0, 8)>
  - <4, (11, 0, 5)>
  - <4, (11, 1, 8)>

So, inside brackets [], we have a total of [44] 3-stars in this graph.
