Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated for each node with three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9 (degree 4)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 10 unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>

- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 10 unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
