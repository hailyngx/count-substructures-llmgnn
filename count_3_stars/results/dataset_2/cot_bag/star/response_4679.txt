Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their edges are as follows:

- Node 0: {7, 14, 10, 11, 5, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 14, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 5, 1}
- Node 3: {7, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 13, 2, 12}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 14, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 11, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {10}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 2}
- Node 10: {7, 6, 8, 0, 12}
- Node 11: {7, 6, 0, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 10, 3}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 12, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 3, 1}

There are 7 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars within the given graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 10, 5)>
<0, (7, 10, 13)>
<0, (7, 11, 13)>
<0, (3, 14, 13)>
<1, (7, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<6, (7, 10, 11)>
<6, (7, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 11, 13)>
<6, (0, 14, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<7, (3, 14, 11)>
<14, (6, 0, 3)>
