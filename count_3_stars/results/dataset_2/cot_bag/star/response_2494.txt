Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 5, 6, 2, 8, 7, 12, 0, 14, 3, 11, 9, 4, 1, and 13. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:

- For node 5, there are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are 3 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 8, there are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 0, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 14, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 11, there are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are 2 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors).
- For node 13, there are 3 ways to choose 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 68 3-stars. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [68].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (6, 8, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 10)>, <2, (8, 4, 9)>, 
<8, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 12, 14)>, <12, (7, 4, 0)>, 
<0, (12, 14, 11)>, <14, (5, 7, 0)>, <3, (7, 14, 9)>, 
<11, (5, 12, 0)>, <9, (2, 8, 3)>, <4, (2, 12, 14)>, 
<13, (3, 11, 1)>.
