Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The graph can be represented visually as:

```
       1
       |
       0
      /|\
   14  4-8
   |\ /| |
   | 12 | 2
   |/ \|/|
   13  9-10
      //|
     5-6
        |
        7
        | 
        3
```

There are 7 nodes with degree 3 or more: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 4, 12>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 11, 14>
<0, 14, 12>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 9, 10>
<4, 12, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 9, 10>
<8, 12, 14>
<9, 10, 11>
<10, 2, 8>
<10, 3, 12>
<10, 11, 13>
<12, 3, 13>
<12, 8, 14>
