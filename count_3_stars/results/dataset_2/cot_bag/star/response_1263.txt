Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 29) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 25) (6, 17) (28, 20) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 21) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 15) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 11) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 9) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 2) (4, 14) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 2) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 11) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 11) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 21) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 21) (23, 25) (21, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 2) 

Response:
There are 18 nodes with at least three neighbors in the graph: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, therefore 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, therefore 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, therefore 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <9, (8, 13, 18)> <9, (13, 24, 18)> <9, (18, 19, 9)> <9, (18, 24, 9)>.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, therefore 10 3-stars: <11, (2, 26, 22)> <11, (16, 18, 27)> <11, (22, 16, 11)> <11, (22, 26, 11)> <11, (26, 21, 11)> <11, (18, 11, 26)> <11, (18, 22, 11)> <11, (18, 16, 27)> <11, (2, 21, 11)> <11, (2, 15, 11)>.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <13, (5, 8, 29)> <13, (13, 8, 29)> <13, (13, 5, 29)> <13, (13, 29, 14)>.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <14, (0, 4, 21)> <14, (0, 21, 14)> <14, (14, 4, 27)> <14, (14, 27, 21)>.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, therefore 10 3-stars: <15, (2, 5, 26)> <15, (2, 11, 15)> <15, (15, 17, 29)> <15, (15, 26, 2)> <15, (15, 26, 21)> <15, (26, 5, 29)> <15, (26, 15, 29)> <15, (26, 21, 11)> <15, (17, 3, 15)> <15, (17, 6, 15)>.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <16, (10, 18, 29)> <16, (10, 22, 11)> <16, (16, 10, 27)> <16, (16, 18, 29)>.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <17, (3, 6, 15)> <17, (3, 15, 17)> <17, (15, 17, 29)> <17, (17, 6, 15)>.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, therefore 10 3-stars: <18, (1, 9, 10)> <18, (1, 18, 11)> <18, (9, 18, 19)> <18, (9, 24, 18)> <18, (11, 16, 27)> <18, (16, 18, 29)> <18, (16, 29, 10)> <18, (16, 27, 11)> <18, (11, 22, 16)> <18, (10, 28, 18)>.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, therefore 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <21, (2, 14, 25)> <21, (2, 21, 25)> <21, (14, 21, 26)> <21, (25, 21, 2)>.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, therefore 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <25, (5, 21, 25)> <25, (5, 23, 25)> <25, (21, 25, 26)> <25, (25, 12, 23)>.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, therefore 10 3-stars: <26, (11, 15, 21)> <26, (11, 21, 22)> <26, (11, 26, 29)> <26, (11, 26, 21)> <26, (11, 18, 26)> <26, (15, 5, 26)> <26, (15, 17, 26)> <26, (15, 29, 26)> <26, (15, 26, 21)> <26, (15, 26, 29)>.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars: <29, (13, 15, 16)> <29, (13, 15, 29)> <29, (15, 26, 29)> <29, (15, 17, 29)>.

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, the total number of 3-stars is [59].
