Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 12) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 11, 0, 14 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 13, 17, 10 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 19, 16, 15, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 13 has neighbors: 5, 17, 0, 18 (4 neighbors)
- Node 14 has neighbors: 3, 15, 12 (3 neighbors)
- Node 17 has neighbors: 5, 13, 15, 16, 4 (5 neighbors)
- Node 18 has neighbors: 13, 19, 9 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 26. Writing out the unique 3-stars:

- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 4)>
- <2, (1, 7, 4)>
- <2, (6, 7, 4)>
- <3, (11, 0, 14)>
- <8, (19, 16, 15)>
- <8, (19, 16, 6)>
- <8, (16, 15, 6)>
- <13, (5, 17, 0)>
- <13, (5, 17, 18)>
- <13, (5, 0, 18)>
- <13, (17, 0, 18)>
- <17, (5, 13, 15)>
- <17, (5, 13, 16)>
- <17, (5, 13, 4)>
- <17, (13, 15, 16)>
- <17, (13, 15, 4)>
- <17, (15, 16, 4)>
- <18, (13, 19, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [26].
