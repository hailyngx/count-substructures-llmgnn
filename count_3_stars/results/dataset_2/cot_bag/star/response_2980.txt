Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 15) (19, 12) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes that have at least 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 18, 15, 13, 3, 8, 17, 11, 12, 0, 1.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars 
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars 
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars 
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars 
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Adding them all up, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (17, 1, 11)>, 
<4, (18, 13, 3)>, 
<18, (11, 1, 13)>, 
<15, (0, 17, 11)>, 
<13, (2, 4, 18)>, 
<3, (4, 8, 6)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<17, (1, 5, 14)>, 
<11, (5, 15, 19)>, 
<12, (7, 9, 19)>, 
<0, (10, 14, 15)>, 
<1, (17, 18, 2)>.
