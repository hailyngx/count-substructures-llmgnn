Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 21) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 22) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 0) (13, 9) (13, 22) (22, 21) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 28) (23, 27) (10, 3) (10, 27) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 24) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (19, 11) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 29) (11, 19) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 28) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 15) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 15) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 29) (20, 22) (20, 8) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 15) (28, 23) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first construct the nodes and edges in a list format.
  
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: {(9, 26), (9, 16), (9, 13), (26, 9), (26, 23), (26, 11), (26, 4), (1, 21), (1, 8), (21, 1), (21, 3), (21, 27), (21, 22), (14, 0), (14, 16), (17, 0), (13, 9), (13, 22), (22, 21), (22, 13), (22, 11), (22, 20), (23, 26), (23, 29), (23, 28), (23, 27), (10, 3), (10, 27), (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 6), (2, 15), (18, 2), (18, 24), (18, 12), (7, 29), (7, 28), (12, 2), (12, 18), (12, 24), (29, 23), (29, 7), (29, 27), (29, 11), (0, 14), (0, 17), (3, 21), (3, 10), (3, 16), (19, 11), (11, 26), (11, 22), (11, 29), (11, 19), (16, 9), (16, 14), (16, 3), (16, 24), (24, 18), (24, 12), (24, 16), (24, 28), (5, 8), (5, 25), (5, 15), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 20), (8, 15), (27, 21), (27, 23), (27, 10), (27, 29), (20, 22), (20, 8), (4, 26), (4, 6), (25, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 15), (28, 23), (28, 7), (28, 24), (28, 15), (15, 2), (15, 5), (15, 8), (15, 6), (15, 28)}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For each of the 16 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [66] \)

Therefore, there are 66 unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
