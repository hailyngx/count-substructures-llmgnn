Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 17) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (7, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 19) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 8, 13, 10, 11, 1, 17, 15, 19, 14, and 0. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44 \)

So, there are 44 3-stars in total in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [44]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<8, (13, 14, 19)>
<13, (8, 14, 19)>
<14, (8, 13, 19)>
<19, (8, 13, 14)>
