Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with their respective neighbors:

1: 0, 4, 5, 7
2: 0, 5, 6
3: 0, 6, 7, 9
4: 0, 1, 8
5: 0, 1, 2
6: 2, 3, 7, 9
7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
8: 1, 4, 9
9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars 
2. Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
3. Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
4. Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
5. Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
6. Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
7. Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
