Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>
