Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 8) (3, 17) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 17) (1, 26) (1, 13) (10, 11) (10, 22) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 27) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 29) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 29) (21, 4) (21, 18) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 6) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 6) (5, 26) (5, 10) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 24) (2, 23) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 4) (22, 10) (22, 14) (22, 16) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 7) (8, 26) (8, 29) (24, 20) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 24) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 22) (28, 9) (28, 13) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 21) (4, 17) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 9, 26, 15, 1, 10, 11, 12, 27, 20, 14, 18, 25, 5, 19, 17, 22, 23, 24, 7, 29, 16, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 3 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<9, 15, 17>, <9, 15, 7>, <9, 25, 27>, <9, 25, 6>, <26, 1, 13>, <26, 1, 8>, <10, 11, 19>, <12, 27, 11>, <14, 22, 4>, <14, 22, 29>, <18, 21, 4>, <18, 21, 23>, <18, 26, 21>, <19, 24, 7>, <17, 2, 23>, <12, 29, 19>, <5, 26, 20>, <1, 13, 28>, <7, 23, 24>, and <17, 3, 15>.
