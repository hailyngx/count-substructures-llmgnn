Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 7, 3, 6, 2  
Node 1: 5, 3, 6  
Node 2: 8, 0  
Node 3: 7, 1, 6, 8, 0  
Node 4: 7, 8  
Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 1, 0  
Node 6: 5, 7, 1, 3, 0  
Node 7: 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 0  
Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2  
Node 9: 5, 9, 8, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 75

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [75].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 3)>
