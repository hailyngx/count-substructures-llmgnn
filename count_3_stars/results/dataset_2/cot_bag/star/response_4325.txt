Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 27) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 18) (10, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 26) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 28) (21, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 27) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 26) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 16) (22, 17) (22, 0) (22, 9) (13, 12) (13, 15) (26, 11) (26, 4) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 4) (15, 13) (15, 25) (15, 28) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 15) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 20) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 25) (16, 9) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 20) (24, 3) (24, 5) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 8) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 2, 4, 10, 11, 14, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28.

For node 2, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 4, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 10, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 11, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 14, we have 5 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 17, we have 6 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
For node 22, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
For node 25, we have 5 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
For node 27, we have 3 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is 1.
For node 28, we have 4 neighbors, thus the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 61 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].
