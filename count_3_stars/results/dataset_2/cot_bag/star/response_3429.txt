Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 2, 8, 7, 1, 6, 3, and 4. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 

Adding these up: 
4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
