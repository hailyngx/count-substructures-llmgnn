Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 1) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 17) (21, 23) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 29) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 18) (1, 22) (1, 2) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 7) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 5) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 19) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 6) (3, 26) (28, 23) (28, 5) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 26) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 11) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 26) (0, 1) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 12) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 26) (11, 9) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 25) (27, 14) (27, 29) (29, 23) (29, 27) (20, 2) (20, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 1) (12, 17) (25, 2) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 9) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, and 19.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (5 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 neighbors)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (5 neighbors)

Adding these up gives a total of 43 3-stars. Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 12, 15)>
<2, (4, 18, 11)>
<5, (8, 26, 28)>
<7, (13, 17, 15)>
<8, (10, 26, 19)>
<11, (9, 18, 26)>
<15, (1, 5, 23)>
<19, (6, 14, 25)>
