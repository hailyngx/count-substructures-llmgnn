Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 17) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 4) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 7) (15, 11) (15, 17) (2, 0) (2, 7) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are no nodes with three or more neighbors to form a 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 0, denoted as [0].
