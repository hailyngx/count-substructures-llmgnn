Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 24) (12, 29) (27, 10) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 26) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 25) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 15) (7, 9) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 21) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 23) (5, 17) (5, 3) (26, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 29) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (23, 0) (23, 13) (11, 24) (24, 12) (24, 4) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 17) (29, 12) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 24) (2, 1) (2, 14) (20, 8) (20, 22) (20, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 29) (21, 9) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 13) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 9) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 20) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 6) (8, 20) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 20) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 13, 16, and 24.

For node 0:
- Degree = 5
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars for node 0: 
<0, (16, 21, 29)>, <0, (16, 21, 25)>, <0, (16, 25, 22)>, <0, (21, 25, 29)>, <0, (21, 25, 16)>, <0, (21, 29, 16)>, <0, (25, 29, 16)>, <0, (25, 22, 16)>, <0, (29, 22, 16)>, <0, (29, 25, 22)>

For node 4:
- Degree = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars for node 4: 
<4, (16, 24, 19)>, <4, (16, 24, 13)>, <4, (19, 24, 17)>, <4, (19, 24, 18)>

For node 13:
- Degree = 5
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars for node 13: 
<13, (1, 9, 28)>, <13, (1, 9, 23)>, <13, (1, 9, 24)>, <13, (1, 9, 15)>, <13, (1, 23, 24)>, <13, (1, 23, 9)>, <13, (1, 24, 15)>, <13, (1, 24, 28)>, <13, (1, 15, 28)>, <13, (1, 15, 9)>

For node 16:
- Degree = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars for node 16: 
<16, (0, 22, 25)>, <16, (0, 22, 28)>, <16, (0, 25, 28)>, <16, (22, 25, 28)>

For node 24:
- Degree = 5
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars for node 24: 
<24, (4, 11, 19)>, <24, (4, 11, 13)>, <24, (4, 19, 14)>, <24, (4, 19, 17)>, <24, (4, 11, 13)>, <24, (4, 11, 2)>, <24, (4, 13, 11)>, <24, (4, 13, 19)>, <24, (4, 14, 19)>, <24, (4, 14, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38\).

Thus, there are 38 3-stars in total. 

Final count: [38]
