Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 8) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 15) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 19) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 0) (15, 5) (15, 16) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (16, 15) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars as follows:
