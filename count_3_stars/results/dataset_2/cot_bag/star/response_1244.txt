Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given data, the nodes with three or more neighbors are node 5, node 9, node 4, node 6, node 12, node 2, node 8, node 13, node 11, and node 0. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 96 \]

So, there are 96 3-stars in total in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ [96] \] 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 13>, <4, 7, 12>, <4, 10, 12>, <4, 11, 12>, <12, 0, 11>, <12, 6, 11>, <12, 10, 11>, <9, 6, 13>, <9, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 10, 11>, <13, 3, 6>, <13, 5, 9>, <12, 1, 6>, <12, 7, 8>, <12, 11, 14>, <6, 2, 12>, <2, 3, 8>
