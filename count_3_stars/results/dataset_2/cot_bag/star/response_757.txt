Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

There are 17 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, and thus we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (5, 9, 17)>
2. Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 27)>
3. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 12, 15)>
4. Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (10, 12, 24)>
5. Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (5, 8, 22)>
6. Node 27 forms 1 3-star: <27, (4, 25, 26)>
7. Node 24 forms 1 3-star: <24, (9, 12, 18)>
8. Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (7, 11, 16)>
9. Node 26 forms 1 3-star: <26, (0, 27, 28)>
10. Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 15, 28)>
11. Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (1, 9, 24)>
12. Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (2, 15, 27)>
13. Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 16)>
14. Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (8, 11, 22)>
15. Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (11, 13, 25)>
16. Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, (12, 20, 23)>
17. Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (2, 9, 23)>

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 17 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
