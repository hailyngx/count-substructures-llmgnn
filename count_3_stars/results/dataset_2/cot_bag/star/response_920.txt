Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (6, 1) (6, 12) (21, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 16) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 18) (27, 13) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 8) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 29) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 8) (28, 22) (28, 23) (18, 11) (18, 25) (18, 23) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 18) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 7) (14, 10) (22, 28) (22, 14) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 2) (29, 3) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (24, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
This graph has the following 3-stars:

[15]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 27)>
<1, (6, 10, 14)>
<2, (4, 12, 20)>
<3, (5, 11, 29)>
<5, (3, 19, 20)>
<8, (0, 16, 27)>
<9, (4, 9, 27)>
<11, (3, 18, 26)>
<12, (2, 6, 29)>
<13, (0, 20, 27)>
<14, (1, 7, 10)>
<16, (8, 15, 29)>
<18, (11, 23, 25)>
<20, (2, 5, 13)>
<25, (18, 23, 27)>
<26, (11, 13, 25)>
<27, (8, 13, 25)>
<29, (3, 12, 16)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
