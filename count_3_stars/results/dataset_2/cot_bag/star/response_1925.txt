Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 18) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 10) (18, 16) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 17) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
3-star: <0, (4, 5, 16)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
3-star: <4, (0, 5, 10)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
3-stars: <8, (3, 5, 17)>, <8, (3, 7, 17)>, <8, (3, 10, 17)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 10, 8)>, <8, (7, 10, 8)>, <8, (5, 16, 8)>, <8, (10, 16, 8)>, <8, (17, 16, 8)>, <8, (2, 17, 8)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <9, (6, 7, 14)>, <9, (6, 14, 17)>, <9, (7, 14, 9)>, <9, (7, 14, 1)>

- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <12, (16, 17, 19)>, <12, (16, 17, 2)>, <12, (17, 19, 12)>, <12, (17, 1, 14)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
3-stars: <15, (4, 6, 16)>, <15, (4, 15, 16)>, <15, (4, 15, 0)>, <15, (6, 16, 15)>, <15, (6, 9, 17)>, <15, (16, 18, 17)>, <15, (16, 0, 4)>, <15, (16, 12, 17)>, <15, (16, 17, 18)>, <15, (16, 17, 15)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars: <16, (0, 15, 17)>, <16, (0, 15, 4)>, <16, (0, 16, 18)>, <16, (4, 15, 16)>, <16, (4, 0, 10)>, <16, (15, 18, 16)>, <16, (17, 12, 19)>, <16, (17, 18, 16)>, <16, (17, 2, 8)>, <16, (17, 8, 5)>

- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars: <17, (8, 9, 16)>, <17, (8, 9, 2)>, <17, (8, 9, 7)>, <17, (9, 12, 16)>, <17, (12, 16, 17)>, <17, (12, 19, 17)>, <17, (16, 18, 17)>, <17, (16, 15, 18)>, <17, (16, 15, 17)>, <17, (16, 0, 4)>

- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <19, (1, 5, 12)>, <19, (1, 12, 14)>, <19, (1, 12, 17)>, <19, (5, 11, 19)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get a total of [44].
