Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 17) (16, 28) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 21) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 19) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (1, 20) (26, 25) (26, 4) (2, 11) (2, 4) (28, 16) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (22, 9) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 18) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 5) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 23) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 25) (12, 11) (12, 16) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 24) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 21) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 13) (24, 14) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 24) (4, 15) (4, 26) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 11, 3, 15, 0, 27, 8, 23, 20, 29, 9, 6, 17, 19, 10, 21, 7, 25, 18, 12, 13, 5, 24, 14, 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].
