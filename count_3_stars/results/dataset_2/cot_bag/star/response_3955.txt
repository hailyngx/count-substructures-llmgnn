Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 16) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 29) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 27) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 14) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 21) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (28, 12) (28, 18) (20, 21) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 23) (11, 3) (23, 11) (23, 2) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 0) (2, 23) (2, 22) (2, 10) (2, 0) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 25) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 29) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 16) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 0) (25, 15) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 25) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 18) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 14) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 15) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 29) (10, 2) (10, 22) (10, 24) 

Response:
We first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For nodes 5, 1, 18, and 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) four times = 40
- For nodes 9, 26, 16, 21, 25, and 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) six times = 24
- For nodes 12, 7, 13, 22, and 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) five times = 5

Summing these up: 40 + 24 + 5 = 69 3-stars are formed in this graph. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 69, represented as [69], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<5, (1, 9, 11)>
<9, (1, 5, 15)>
<12, (5, 13, 28)>
<13, (12, 25, 27)>
<16, (4, 21, 29)>
<18, (5, 15, 26)>
<21, (4, 16, 26)>
<22, (2, 10, 25)>
<25, (13, 15, 22)>
<26, (18, 21, 28)>
<29, (16, 14, 21)>
