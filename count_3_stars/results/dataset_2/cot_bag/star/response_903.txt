Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3, node 4, and node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 20] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (2, 4, 3)>
