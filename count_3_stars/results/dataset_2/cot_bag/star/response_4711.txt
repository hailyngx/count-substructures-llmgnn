Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph described, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 6 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 12)>, <1, (2, 5, 12)>, <1, (2, 8, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 12)>, <1, (3, 5, 2)>, <1, (3, 12, 5)>, <1, (5, 12, 2)>, <1, (8, 5, 2)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
<3, (1, 5, 12)>, <3, (2, 5, 12)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 12)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 11, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 6, 12)>, <5, (3, 12, 6)>, <5, (3, 2, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 13)>, <5, (11, 6, 13)>, <5, (11, 6, 1)>, <5, (6, 13, 11)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (5, 13, 4)>, <6, (5, 11, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 10, 4)>, <6, (13, 4, 10)>, <6, (13, 4, 11)>, <6, (13, 4, 14)>, <6, (11, 4, 10)>, <6, (11, 4, 13)>, <6, (11, 4, 14)>

- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<13, (0, 4, 14)>, <13, (0, 4, 9)>, <13, (0, 4, 10)>, <13, (0, 4, 11)>, <13, (0, 4, 13)>, <13, (7, 9, 14)>, <13, (7, 9, 4)>, <13, (7, 9, 10)>, <13, (7, 9, 11)>, <13, (7, 9, 13)>, <13, (7, 14, 10)>, <13, (7, 14, 11)>, <13, (7, 14, 4)>, <13, (7, 14, 13)>, <13, (9, 14, 10)>, <13, (9, 14, 11)>, <13, (9, 14, 4)>, <13, (9, 14, 13)>, <13, (14, 10, 11)>, <13, (14, 10, 4)>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<14, (7, 10, 4)>, <14, (7, 4, 9)>, <14, (7, 4, 13)>, <14, (7, 4, 10)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58 \) 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [58].
