Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with their respective neighbors (directly connected nodes) are as follows:

1: {3, 5, 9, 7}
2: {3, 4, 6, 0}
3: {1, 7, 6, 2}
4: {8, 2, 9, 0}
5: {1, 8, 7, 0}
6: {3, 8, 7, 2}
7: {1, 3, 6, 5}
8: {4, 9, 5, 6}
9: {1, 4, 8, 0}
0: {4, 9, 2, 5}

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \), which gives us [40].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (8, 2, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 8, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
