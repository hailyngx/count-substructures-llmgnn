Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 14) (15, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 18) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 17) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 6) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 16, 10, 12
- Node 1: Connected to node 19
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 16, 9, 7, 6, 17
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 18
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 11, 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 13, 4, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 10, 18, 2, 12
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 2
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 13, 14
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 11, 4, 2, 17
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 12
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 19, 14, 4, 9
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 0, 10, 6
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 5, 15
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 8, 19, 11, 18
- Node 15: Connected to node 13
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 9, 2
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 3, 14, 6
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 1, 11, 14

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that include that node. 

- Node 2: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star

Adding up the counts, we get a total of 15 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <2, (0, 16, 17)>
2. <2, (6, 10, 12)>
3. <2, (7, 6, 17)>
4. <2, (9, 4, 17)>
5. <4, (5, 11, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 10, 12)>
7. <7, (3, 5, 7)>
8. <9, (11, 4, 9)>
9. <10, (0, 6, 12)>
10. <11, (14, 19, 18)>
11. <12, (0, 10, 6)>
12. <14, (8, 11, 19)>
13. <16, (0, 2, 17)>
14. <17, (9, 2, 7)>
15. <18, (3, 14, 6)>
