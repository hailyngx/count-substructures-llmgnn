Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes connected to each other are: 
- Node 0: 9, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6, 14
- Node 3: 7, 1, 10, 12, 11
- Node 4: 8, 10
- Node 5: 13, 2, 1, 11
- Node 6: 9, 1, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 12, 0, 3, 11, 2
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 14
- Node 9: 8, 6, 0, 12
- Node 10: 4, 3, 12, 2
- Node 11: 5, 7, 13, 3, 14
- Node 12: 9, 7, 10, 3, 14
- Node 13: 5, 11
- Node 14: 8, 12, 11, 2

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 and Node 4 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so there are 2 3-stars each.
Node 1, 5, 8, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have more than 3 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars each.

Adding them up, we have a total of \( 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 56 + 56 = 124 \) 3-stars.

In brackets: [124]
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (8, 10, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 11)>, <8, (6, 9, 0)>, <9, (8, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 14)>, <3, (12, 10, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 1)>, <7, (2, 12, 0)>, <10, (12, 2, 3)>, <11, (5, 13, 7)>, <12, (9, 7, 3)>, <14, (11, 2, 12)>
