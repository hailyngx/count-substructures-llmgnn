Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to determine if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 5), (0, 1) => forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 9) => <0, (6, 9, 1)>
- Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 0) => forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 9) => <1, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 5) => forms a 3-star with (2, 4, 7) => <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5) => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 2) => forms a 3-star with (4, 7, 5) => <4, (7, 5, 2)>
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 3) => forms a 3-star with (5, 4, 7) => <5, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 0) => forms a 3-star with (6, 9, 5) => <6, (9, 5, 0)>
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1) => forms a 3-star with (7, 4, 2) => <7, (4, 2, 8)>
- Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 1) => Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0) => forms a 3-star with (9, 6, 2) => <9, (6, 2, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
