Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 0) (15, 9) (27, 0) (27, 7) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 23) (4, 12) (4, 23) (18, 9) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 29) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 25) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 10) (5, 21) (5, 2) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 24) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 25) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 13) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (23, 0) (23, 4) (29, 3) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 22) (13, 21) (13, 25) (13, 16) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 1) (24, 14) (7, 27) (7, 19) (8, 18) (8, 11) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 20) (20, 16) (20, 22) (10, 28) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- For node 11, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 12, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- For node 17, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 19, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- For node 21, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 24, there are \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- For node 25, there are \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- For node 26, there are \({1 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars.
- For node 28, there are \({2 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars.
- For node 29, there are \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star.

Adding up all the possibilities, we get a total of \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 67\) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([67]\).

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 6, 24>
<6, 1, 29>
<9, 18, 8>
<11, 3, 29>
<12, 4, 24>
<17, 11, 21>
<19, 9, 25>
<21, 6, 17>
<24, 1, 14>
<25, 6, 21>
