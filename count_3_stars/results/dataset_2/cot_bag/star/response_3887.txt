Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 6) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 13) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 22) (6, 16) (24, 22) (24, 2) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 4) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 25) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (15, 9) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 2) (22, 0) (25, 21) (25, 17) (25, 29) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 23) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (3, 18) (1, 28) (1, 4) (14, 27) (14, 19) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 28) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (4, 26) (4, 20) (4, 1) (4, 13) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 29) (29, 25) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 13) (28, 1) (28, 18) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 9) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
8. Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
9. Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
10. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<11, (16, 17, 9)>, <16, (11, 22, 6)>, <16, (11, 19, 9)>, <16, (17, 2, 21)>,
<16, (17, 19, 14)>, <16, (22, 5, 24)>, <16, (22, 6, 19)>, <16, (22, 24, 2)>,
<16, (22, 24, 0)>, <16, (5, 22, 18)>, <7, (21, 12, 25)>, <7, (21, 17, 25)>,
<21, (7, 25, 29)>, <27, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (7, 18, 22)>, <26, (7, 8, 4)>,
<17, (7, 20, 25)>, <17, (11, 7, 20)>, <17, (11, 20, 10)>, <17, (25, 20, 29)>,
<20, (17, 8, 4)>, <20, (8, 4, 29)>, <10, (20, 9, 15)>.
