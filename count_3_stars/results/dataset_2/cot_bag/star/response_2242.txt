Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 17) (16, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 1) (15, 9) (15, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (18, 13) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) 

Response:
There are some nodes with only 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with them. Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

The nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 6, 9, 7, 12, 19, 13, 17, 4, 0, 3, 11, 1, 2, 15, 14, 18, 10, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get 36 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [36]. The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (9, 11, 12)>, <9, (6, 11, 0)>, <7, (12, 10, 14)>, <12, (6, 7, 4)>, <19, (9, 5, 3)>, <13, (17, 4, 2)>, <17, (7, 13, 16)>, <4, (12, 13, 1)>, <0, (9, 3, 11)>, <3, (19, 0, 18)>, <11, (6, 9, 0)>, <2, (13, 17, 1)>, <10, (7, 16, 8)>.
