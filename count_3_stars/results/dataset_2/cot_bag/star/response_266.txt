Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 5) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with degree < 3: No 3-stars
- For nodes with degree = 3: 1 3-star per node
- For nodes with degree > 3: \( \binom{n}{3} \)

The total number of 3-stars formed is as follows:
- For nodes with degree 3: 1 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 7
- For nodes with degree > 3: \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7 + 30] = 37.

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<1, (10, 5, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<6, (2, 11, 13)>
<9, (12, 14, 4)>
<14, (0, 1, 11)>
