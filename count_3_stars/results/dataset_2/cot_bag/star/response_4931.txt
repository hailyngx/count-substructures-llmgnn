Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
1: 6, 8, 0, 10
2: 8, 7, 5, 11, 10
3: 8, 12, 0, 14, 10
4: 9, 12, 14, 10
5: 8, 0, 2
6: 1, 7, 12
7: 6, 12, 11, 2
8: 13, 2, 5, 3, 1
9: 4, 11, 13
10: 2, 4, 1, 3
11: 9, 7, 14, 2
12: 6, 7, 4, 3
13: 9, 8, 0
14: 0, 11, 3, 4

From the list above, we see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11 have at least three neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (10, 2, 8)>
<2, (7, 11, 14)>
<3, (0, 13, 8)>
<4, (9, 12, 10)>
<7, (11, 14, 2)>
<11, (9, 7, 14)>
