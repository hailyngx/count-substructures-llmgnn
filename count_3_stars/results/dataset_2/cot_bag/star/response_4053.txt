Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 8
   /|\   |  /| 
  5 | 4 7 2 |
   \|/   |  \| 
    9 -- 6 -- 3
            /
           /
          5
```

Let's list the 3-stars found within this graph:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 0 has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  
Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [6].
