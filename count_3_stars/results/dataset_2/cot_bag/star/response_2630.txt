Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 11, 1, 3, 8, 13, 12, 0, 2, 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 70

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, 1, 14>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 10>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 11>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 5, 11>, <6, 11, 13>, <9, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 14>, <7, 9, 8>, <7, 4, 13>, <7, 4, 8>, <10, 5, 2>, <10, 5, 11>, <10, 14, 7>, <11, 6, 13>, <11, 6, 1>, <11, 6, 3>, <11, 13, 7>, <11, 13, 3>, <1, 5, 14>, <3, 2, 0>, <3, 11, 13>, <3, 11, 12>, <3, 11, 2>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 4, 13>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 0, 2>, <13, 6, 11>, <13, 6, 14>, <13, 11, 3>, <13, 11, 8>, <13, 11, 14>, <13, 7, 14>, <13, 7, 8>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 3, 2>, <12, 3, 4>, <12, 11, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 10, 3>, <2, 10, 14>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 14>, <2, 14, 7>, <14, 7, 8>
