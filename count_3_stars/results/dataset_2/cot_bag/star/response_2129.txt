Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 19) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 6) (15, 10) (15, 8) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 9, 13, 8
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 11, 7
Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 14, 11, 15, 12, 1
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 7, 6
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 10, 4, 7, 3
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 12, 19, 3
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 11, 12, 16, 18, 2
Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 4, 0, 2, 6, 16
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 13, 4, 12, 2, 18

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<5, (9, 13, 8)>

Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<9, (5, 11, 7)>

Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<10, (14, 11, 15)>, <10, (14, 11, 12)>, <10, (14, 11, 1)>, <10, (14, 15, 1)>, <10, (11, 15, 12)>, <10, (11, 15, 1)>, <10, (11, 12, 1)>, <10, (15, 12, 1)>, <10, (15, 12, 3)>, <10, (11, 12, 3)>

Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<11, (9, 10, 7)>, <11, (9, 10, 6)>, <11, (9, 7, 6)>, <11, (10, 7, 6)>

Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<12, (10, 4, 7)>, <12, (10, 4, 3)>, <12, (10, 7, 3)>, <12, (4, 7, 3)>

Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<4, (12, 19, 3)>

Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<7, (11, 12, 16)>, <7, (11, 12, 18)>, <7, (11, 12, 2)>, <7, (11, 16, 18)>, <7, (11, 16, 2)>, <7, (12, 16, 18)>, <7, (12, 16, 2)>, <7, (16, 18, 2)>, <7, (12, 18, 2)>, <7, (16, 18, 2)>

Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<19, (4, 0, 2)>, <19, (4, 0, 6)>, <19, (4, 0, 16)>, <19, (4, 2, 6)>, <19, (4, 2, 16)>, <19, (0, 2, 6)>, <19, (0, 2, 16)>, <19, (2, 6, 16)>, <19, (0, 6, 16)>, <19, (2, 6, 16)>

Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
<3, (13, 4, 12)>, <3, (13, 4, 2)>, <3, (13, 4, 18)>, <3, (13, 12, 2)>, <3, (13, 12, 18)>, <3, (4, 2, 18)>, <3, (4, 12, 2)>, <3, (4, 12, 18)>, <3, (4, 2, 18)>, <3, (12, 2, 18)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [41].
