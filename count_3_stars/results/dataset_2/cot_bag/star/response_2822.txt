Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 20) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 12) (17, 4) (17, 29) (29, 17) (29, 3) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 1) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (22, 4) (22, 0) (22, 5) (22, 28) (18, 11) (18, 13) (3, 7) (3, 29) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 15) (2, 13) (5, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 22) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 3) (27, 23) (23, 20) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 2 3-stars
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 2 3-stars
- Node 24: 2 3-stars
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 2 3-stars
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 44 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 27>
<2, 13, 18>
<3, 7, 21>
<4, 8, 11>
<5, 15, 22>
<6, 24, 12>
<8, 11, 19>
<10, 15, 2>
<12, 11, 13>
<20, 5, 15>
<21, 7, 20>
<22, 0, 4>
<23, 6, 24>
<24, 12, 26>
<27, 1, 19>
<28, 22, 25>
<29, 3, 17>

These 3-stars form the complete list of unique 3-stars in the given graph.
