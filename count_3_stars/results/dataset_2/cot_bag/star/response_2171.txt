Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 11, 1, 3, 8, and 12.  

For node 6, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
For node 9, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 10, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 11, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 1, there are \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.  
For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 8, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 12, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 57 \)  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].
