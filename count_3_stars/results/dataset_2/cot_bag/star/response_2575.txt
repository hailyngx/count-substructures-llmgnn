Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 8, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, 2, 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 7, 2, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 3, 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, 7, 0

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars together: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 0)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 4)>
<7, (8, 3, 0)>
<7, (7, 6, 9)>
<7, (7, 6, 3)>
