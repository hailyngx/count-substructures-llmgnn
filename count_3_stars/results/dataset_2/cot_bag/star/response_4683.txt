Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

Some of the unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (8, 12, 3)>
<1, (9, 14, 5)>
<2, (6, 14, 0)>
<3, (9, 12, 5)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>
<5, (12, 11, 3)>
<6, (13, 11, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 13)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<11, (6, 7, 14)>
<12, (8, 0, 5)>
<13, (6, 8, 10)>
<14, (1, 2, 10)>
