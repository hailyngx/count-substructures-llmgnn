Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (1, 7) (1, 17) (15, 10) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (18, 16) (18, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 5, 8, 4, 7, 0, 14, 2, 17, 6, 19, 13, 3, and 12. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\)

Adding these up we get a total of 41 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41]. The unique 3-stars are:  
<11, (16, 17, 19)>
<16, (11, 13, 17)>
<16, (8, 5, 6)>
<16, (13, 17, 3)>
<5, (11, 9, 8)>
<8, (16, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<7, (6, 0, 14)>
<7, (1, 17, 13)>
<0, (14, 6, 18)>
<0, (2, 19, 9)>
<0, (6, 14, 18)>
<14, (0, 6, 18)>
<2, (10, 12, 17)>
<17, (11, 1, 13)>
<17, (13, 12, 3)>
<6, (16, 7, 14)>
<19, (11, 0, 14)>
