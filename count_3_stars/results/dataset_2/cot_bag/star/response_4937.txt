Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- For node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 5: C(6, 3) = 20
- For node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 8: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 9: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 11: C(3, 3) = 1
- For node 12: C(4, 3) = 4
- For node 13: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 14: C(5, 3) = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of [89] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<0, (7, 14, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 12)>
<5, (6, 10, 3)>
<5, (7, 13, 5)>
<5, (9, 13, 14)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<6, (3, 12, 8)>
<7, (13, 5, 11)>
<8, (14, 9, 3)>
<11, (9, 13, 1)>
<12, (6, 3, 8)>
<13, (7, 14, 9)>
<14, (7, 13, 5)>
