This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 26) (10, 4) (10, 21) (17, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 21) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 18) (20, 4) (20, 5) (20, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 2) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (23, 20) (23, 9) (23, 12) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 27) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 0) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 25) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (24, 29) (24, 18) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 18) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can now identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute to any 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [69].
