Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 6) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 10) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. We will consider only nodes with a degree of 3 or more.

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 5 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 5: <5, (11, 15, 18)>, <5, (10, 13, 15)>, <5, (11, 15, 18)>, <5, (10, 15, 18)>

For Node 6:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 6: <6, (1, 14, 19)>, <6, (1, 3, 14)>, <6, (3, 12, 14)>, <6, (9, 14, 19)>

For Node 10:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 10 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 10: <10, (4, 18, 19)>, <10, (5, 10, 18)>, <10, (4, 10, 18)>, <10, (5, 10, 19)>

For Node 13:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 13 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 13: <13, (4, 14, 16)>, <13, (3, 14, 16)>, <13, (3, 13, 14)>, <13, (4, 13, 14)>

For Node 18:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 18 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 18: <18, (8, 10, 19)>, <18, (5, 10, 18)>, <18, (8, 18, 19)>, <18, (5, 18, 10)>

For Node 19:
- Number of 3-stars involving Node 19 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 19: <19, (2, 10, 19)>, <19, (2, 6, 19)>, <19, (6, 14, 19)>, <19, (0, 6, 19)>

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes with degree 3 or more, we get a total of 24 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [24].
