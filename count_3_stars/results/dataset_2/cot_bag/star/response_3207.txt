Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 18) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 19) (6, 14) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 15) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 12) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 12, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (8, 12, 13)>, <0, (8, 12, 18)>, <0, (8, 13, 18)>, <0, (12, 13, 18)>
  
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (7, 17, 18)>, <3, (7, 10, 17)>, <3, (7, 10, 18)>, <3, (10, 17, 18)>
  
- For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- For node 19: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
