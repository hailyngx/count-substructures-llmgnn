Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 8) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (3, 10) (14, 4) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 16, 9, 1, and 13.
  Number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 11, 6, 9, and 4.
  Number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 2, 18, 13, and 0.
  Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 15, 0, and 19.
  Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 16, 17, 3, and 19.
  Number of 3-stars for node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 1, 12, and 2.
  Number of 3-stars for node 11: 1

- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 11, 5, and 15.
  Number of 3-stars for node 12: 1

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, and 0.
  Number of 3-stars for node 13: 1

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 9, 12, 1, and 14.
  Number of 3-stars for node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 10, 5, 8, and 7.
  Number of 3-stars for node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 9, 10, and 8.
  Number of 3-stars for node 19: 1

Summing up all the 3-stars from the above calculations:
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 44. Representing them individually, we have:
\[ \left[44\right] \]

And the unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, 16, 9, 1>, <0, 16, 9, 13>, <0, 9, 6, 2>, <0, 9, 6, 13>, <0, 9, 15, 1>, <0, 9, 15, 13>, <0, 1, 11, 2>, <0, 1, 15, 13>, <2, 11, 6, 9>, <2, 11, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 4, 13>, <6, 9, 15, 1>, <6, 9, 15, 14>, <6, 9, 0, 13>, <6, 9, 0, 15>, <9, 10, 17, 3>, <9, 10, 17, 19>, <9, 17, 5, 7>, <9, 17, 5, 8>, <10, 3, 17, 7>, <10, 3, 17, 8>, <10, 17, 5, 7>, <10, 17, 5, 8> >
