Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 8) (27, 14) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 10) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 29) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 21) (9, 25) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 17) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 13) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 20) (13, 9) (13, 18) (26, 10) (26, 29) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 1) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 7) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 24) (24, 21) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 29) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star with {15, 25, 11} (total 3-stars = 1)
2. Node 15 forms a 3-star with {3, 19, 17} (total 3-stars = 1)
3. Node 25 forms a 3-star with {3, 17, 9} (total 3-stars = 1)
4. Node 22 forms a 3-star with {0, 6, 10} (total 3-stars = 1)
5. Node 29 forms a 3-star with {5, 23, 26} (total 3-stars = 1)

Counting the 3-stars formed from each node with at least three neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (15, 25, 11)>, <15, (3, 19, 17)>, <25, (3, 17, 9)>, <22, (0, 6, 10)>, <29, (5, 23, 26)>
