Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 59 \]

So, there are a total of 59 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>. 

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets: [59].
