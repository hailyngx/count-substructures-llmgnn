Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 7

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For node 9: [inom{7}{3}] = 35

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 87

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [87].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, 0, 8>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <2, 0, 3>
- <2, 0, 6>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 0, 2>
- <3, 0, 6>
- <4, 1, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <6, 2, 3>
- <8, 0, 9>
- <9, 1, 8>
- <9, 1, 4>
- <9, 8, 0>
- <9, 8, 7>
