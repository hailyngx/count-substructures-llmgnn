Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: 6 neighbors, inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 10: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 6 neighbors, inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node: 
4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 85 

So, there are a total of 85 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [85].

And the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (12, 1, 14)>
<2, (12, 2, 1)>
<3, (13, 3, 11)>
<4, (12, 4, 13)>
<5, (8, 5, 14)>
<6, (6, 11, 14)>
<7, (10, 7, 0)>
<10, (1, 10, 7)>
<11, (4, 11, 2)>
<12, (12, 7, 0)>
<13, (13, 9, 6)>
<14, (6, 14, 1)>
