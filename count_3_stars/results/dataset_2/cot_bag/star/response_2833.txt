Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 19) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (9, 8) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 5) (16, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 18) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up these counts gives a total of 82 3-stars in the graph. So, we write this as [82].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 14, 19)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<5, (2, 7, 12)>
<7, (5, 11, 17)>
<8, (13, 15, 9)>
<11, (3, 13, 15)>
<13, (8, 17, 9)>
<15, (8, 10, 18)>
<17, (1, 13, 7)>
<18, (10, 15, 12)>
<19, (1, 11, 18)>
