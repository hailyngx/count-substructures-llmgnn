Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 12) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 1) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors -> 0 3-stars
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 12, 14)>, 
<2, (3, 9, 11)>, 
<4, (9, 15, 18)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 10)>, 
<8, (7, 11, 12)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 19)>, 
<10, (5, 7, 19)>, 
<11, (2, 8, 14)>, 
<12, (0, 7, 18)>, 
<13, (1, 14, 17)>, 
<14, (13, 17, 15)>, 
<15, (4, 5, 14)>, 
<17, (13, 14, 19)>, 
<18, (4, 7, 12)>, 
<19, (9, 10, 17)>.
