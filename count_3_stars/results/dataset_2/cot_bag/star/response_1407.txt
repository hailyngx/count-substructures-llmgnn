Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 6, 2, 9  
Node 1: 4, 7, 3, 5, 9  
Node 2: 4, 5, 0, 9  
Node 3: 7, 1, 9, 8  
Node 4: 1, 2  
Node 5: 7, 1, 8, 6, 2  
Node 6: 8, 5, 0  
Node 7: 3, 1, 5, 9  
Node 8: 3, 9, 5, 6  
Node 9: 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 1.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 3.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars centered at node 9.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [44]. \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
