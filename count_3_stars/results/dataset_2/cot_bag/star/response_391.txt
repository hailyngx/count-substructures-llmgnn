Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 10, 7  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 12, 4  
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 8, 9, 5, 11  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 2, 9, 11, 7  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 12, 9  
Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 13  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 14, 10, 11, 9, 2  
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 3, 0, 6, 9, 5  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 8, 0, 10  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 14, 10  
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 3, 12, 11, 10  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 4, 8, 7, 0, 14  
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 14  
Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 1, 0, 2, 5, 13  
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 0, 13  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 1 3-star  
- Node 3: 4 3-stars  
- Node 4: 6 3-stars  
- Node 8: 6 3-stars  
- Node 7: 4 3-stars  
- Node 12: 1 3-star  
- Node 0: 6 3-stars  
- Node 14: 6 3-stars  
- Node 2: 1 3-star  
- Node 5: 1 3-star  
- Node 13: 4 3-stars  
- Node 9: 6 3-stars  
- Node 6: 0 3-stars  
- Node 10: 6 3-stars  
- Node 11: 4 3-stars  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 0 + 6 + 4 = 50  

So, the final answer is [50].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, 6, 10, 7>  
<3, 14, 13, 12>  
<4, 3, 8, 9>  
<7, 1, 8, 12>  
<4, 8, 9, 11>  
<0, 14, 10, 11>  
<0, 14, 9, 5>  
<4, 9, 8, 7>  
<0, 2, 8, 9>  
<0, 14, 5, 10>  
<0, 10, 2, 5>  
<0, 10, 13, 11>
