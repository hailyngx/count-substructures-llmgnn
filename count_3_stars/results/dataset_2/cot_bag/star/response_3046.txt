Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9, 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 7, 6, 9, 5
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9, 5, 8
- Node 4: 8, 0
- Node 5: 7, 3, 8, 2, 0
- Node 6: 7, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 6, 9, 2, 5
- Node 8: 4, 3, 6, 5
- Node 9: 7, 3, 6, 2, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of [13] unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<6, (7, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 0)>
<6, (2, 0, 8)>
<8, (4, 3, 5)>
<9, (7, 3, 6)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>
<9, (3, 2, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>
