- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 4
- Node 11: 5
- Node 12: 4
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 2
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 4
- Node 20: 2
- Node 21: 3
- Node 22: 3
- Node 23: 4
- Node 24: 2
- Node 25: 3
- Node 27: 2
- Node 28: 2
- Node 29: 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 1)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: 6 3-stars
- Node 11: 4 3-stars
- Node 12: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 1)
- Node 13: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 3)
- Node 17: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 28)
- Node 18: 6 3-stars
- Node 19: 6 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 17)
- Node 22: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: 4 3-stars
- Node 24: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 6)
- Node 27: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: 0 3-stars (3 neighbors but all connected to node 17)
- Node 29: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives a total of [23].
