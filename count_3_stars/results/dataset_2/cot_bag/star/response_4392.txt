Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 3) (5, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are five nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 6, 9, 10, 14, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 6:
The neighbors of node 6 are 9, 14, 10, 2, 4, and 13. This gives us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars containing node 6.

For node 9:
The neighbors of node 9 are 6, 4, 14, and 12. This gives us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars containing node 9.

For node 10:
The neighbors of node 10 are 6, 1, 11, 7, 2, and 14. This gives us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars containing node 10.

For node 14:
The neighbors of node 14 are 6, 9, 10, 11, 8, 12. This gives us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars containing node 14.

For node 3:
The neighbors of node 3 are 1, 7, 5, 8. This gives us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars containing node 3.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes gives us a total of \( 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 68 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <9, (6, 4, 14)>, <10, (6, 1, 11)>, <14, (6, 10, 11)>, and <3, (1, 7, 5)>.
