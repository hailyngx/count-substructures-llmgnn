Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes (6, 7, 4, 0, 14) that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- 3 stars: [3 choose 3] = 1
<6, (9, 7, 4)>

For node 7:
- 3 stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
<7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 9, 14)>, <7, (6, 0, 11)>, <7, (6, 11, 14)>, <7, (9, 0, 14)>, <7, (9, 0, 11)>, <7, (4, 0, 14)>, <7, (4, 0, 11)>, <7, (0, 14, 11)>, <7, (0, 11, 3)>

For node 4:
- 3 stars: [6 choose 3] = 20
<4, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (6, 9, 10)>, <4, (6, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 8, 10)>, <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (6, 10, 5)>, <4, (9, 8, 10)>, <4, (9, 8, 5)>, <4, (9, 10, 5)>, <4, (8, 10, 5)>, <4, (8, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 1)>, <4, (10, 5, 2)>, <4, (10, 5, 1)>, <4, (5, 2, 1)>, <4, (5, 14, 13)>, <4, (5, 14, 2)>, <4, (5, 14, 1)>, <4, (5, 13, 2)>, <4, (5, 13, 1)>

For node 0:
- 3 stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
<0, (6, 9, 14)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 11)>, <0, (6, 11, 3)>, <0, (9, 14, 13)>, <0, (9, 14, 13)>, <0, (14, 13, 3>), <0, (14, 13, 5)>, <0, (13, 3, 11)>, <0, (13, 5, 14)>

For node 14:
- 3 stars: [5 choose 3] = 10
<14, (6, 9, 13)>, <14, (6, 9, 7>), <14, (6, 7, 11)>, <14, (6, 11, 3)>, <14, (9, 13, 12)>, <14,(9, 13, 3)>, <14, (13, 12, 10)>, <14, (13, 3, 11)>, <14, (12, 10, 3)>, <14, (12, 10, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51].
