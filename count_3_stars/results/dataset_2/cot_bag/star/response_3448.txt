Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are:
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors: {1, 16, 2, 6}
- Node 2 with 5 neighbors: {4, 9, 0, 6, 11}
- Node 3 with 4 neighbors: {1, 14, 5}
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors: {3, 19, 11, 15}
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors: {8, 13, 0, 2}
- Node 7 with 4 neighbors: {10, 18, 13}
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors: {1, 8, 2, 13}
- Node 13 with 5 neighbors: {17, 7, 9, 11, 6}
- Node 15 with 2 neighbors: {5, 16}
- Node 16 with 3 neighbors: {18, 0, 15}
- Node 17 with 3 neighbors: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 18 with 3 neighbors: {7, 16, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]]
  - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 11)>
  - <2, (9, 11, 4)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 4)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 11, 6)>
  - <2, (9, 11, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 11, 4)>
  - <2, (4, 9, 11)>
  - <2, (4, 0, 6)>
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <3, (1, 5, 14)>
- Node 5: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <5, (3, 11, 15)>
- Node 6: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <7, (10, 13, 18)>
- Node 9: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]]
  - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 13: [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]]
  - <13, (7, 11, 17)>
  - <13, (6, 9, 11)>
  - <13, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <13, (6, 7, 11)>
  - <13, (9, 11, 17)>
  - <13, (6, 9, 17)>
  - <13, (6, 11, 17)>
  - <13, (9, 11, 7)>
  - <13, (6, 11, 7)>
  - <13, (6, 9, 7)>
  
Adding up all the 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].
