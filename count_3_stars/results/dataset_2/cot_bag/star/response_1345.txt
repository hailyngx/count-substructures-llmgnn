Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Out of 1, 4, 5, 7 (degree 4), we can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars. 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 3)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>

Node 1: Out of 6, 4, 2, 7, 9 (degree 5), we can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<1, (6, 2, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (2, 9, 4)>

Node 3: Out of 6, 4, 0, 7 (degree 4), we can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 4, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>

Node 5: Out of 6, 4, 0 (degree 3), we can form only 1 3-star.
<5, (6, 4, 0)>

Node 6: Out of 1, 3, 5, 2, 8 (degree 5), we can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
<6, (1, 5, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>

Node 7: Out of 2, 0, 3, 1 (degree 4), we can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
<7, (2, 0, 3)>
<7, (2, 0, 1)>
<7, (2, 3, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 1)>

Node 9: Out of 8, 2, 1, 0 (degree 4), we can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>
<9, (8, 1, 0)>
<9, (2, 1, 0)>


There are total of [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 37 3-stars. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].
