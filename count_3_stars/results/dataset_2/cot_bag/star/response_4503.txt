Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 11)
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 13), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 11)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 10), (4, 6), (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 14), (6, 11), (6, 12)
- Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 13), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 14)
- Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1)
- Node 10: (10, 4), (10, 14)
- Node 11: (11, 8), (11, 6), (11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 6), (12, 14)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 2), (13, 7)
- Node 14: (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 11), (14, 12), (14, 10)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars. Then we can list out the unique 3-stars using the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:  
1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2)
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 7) 
3. Node 4: (4, 2, 6) 
4. Node 6: (6, 4, 11), (6, 4, 12), (6, 11, 14), (6, 12, 14) 
5. Node 7: (7, 2, 14)
6. Node 9: (9, 1, 6)
7. Node 11: (11, 0, 2), (11, 0, 14), (11, 2, 14)
8. Node 13: (13, 2, 7)

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<2, (0, 7, 2)>
<4, (2, 6, 4)>
<6, (4, 11, 6)>
<6, (4, 12, 6)>
<6, (11, 14, 6)>
<6, (12, 14, 6)>
<7, (2, 14, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<11, (0, 2, 11)>
<11, (0, 14, 11)>
<11, (2, 14, 11)>
<13, (2, 7, 13)>
