Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 6 and 4. 

For node 6:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with this node, which are:
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>

For node 4:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with this node, which are:
<4, (8, 5, 1)>
<4, (8, 5, 3)>
<4, (8, 5, 2)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 7)>
<4, (8, 3, 2)>
<4, (8, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 10] = 14\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14.
