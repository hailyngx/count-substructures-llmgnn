Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 11) (7, 14) (7, 25) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 23) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 0) (25, 17) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 22) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 3) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 13) (16, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (29, 1) (29, 18) (23, 21) (23, 5) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 27) (24, 22) (6, 27) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 22) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 24) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 29) (18, 11) (19, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]
Node 10: [1]
Node 13: [1]
Node 14: [1]
Node 15: [1]
Node 17: [1]
Node 18: [1]
Node 20: [1]
Node 21: [1]
Node 22: [1]
Node 25: [1]
Node 26: [1]
Node 27: [1]
Node 28: [1]
Node 29: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [19]
