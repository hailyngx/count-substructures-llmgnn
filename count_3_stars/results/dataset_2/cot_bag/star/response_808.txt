Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 5) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (13, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 15) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 19
- Node 1: 3, 13, 8
- Node 2: 11, 15
- Node 3: 1, 11, 16, 4
- Node 4: 3, 18, 5
- Node 5: 14, 4, 18, 13, 19
- Node 6: 14, 10, 9, 19
- Node 7: 11, 13
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 6, 16
- Node 10: 15, 6, 16
- Node 11: 3, 7, 2
- Node 12: 13, 15
- Node 13: 1, 7, 12, 18, 5
- Node 14: 6, 19, 16, 5
- Node 15: 10, 12, 2
- Node 16: 14, 3, 10, 9
- Node 18: 4, 19, 5, 13
- Node 19: 14, 6, 18, 5, 0

Let's calculate the 3-stars. 

For Node 14: <14, (6, 19, 16)>, <14, (6, 5, 18)>, and <14, (19, 5, 13)> = 3
For Node 4: <4, (3, 18, 5)> and <4, (5, 18, 13)> = 2
For Node 5: <5, (14, 18, 13)> and <5, (18, 13, 19)> = 2
For Node 6: <6, (14, 19, 16)> = 1
For Node 3: <3, (1, 11, 16)> = 1
For Node 19: <19, (14, 18, 5)> = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Thus, the final answer is [10].
