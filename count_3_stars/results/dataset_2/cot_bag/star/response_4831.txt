Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\[ [ 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 ] = [ 66 ]\]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
