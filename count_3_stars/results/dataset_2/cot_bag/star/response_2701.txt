Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 19) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (18, 17) (18, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (0, 13, 5)>
- <5, (3, 0, 19)>
- <10, (11, 7, 10)>
- <11, (10, 13, 7)>
- <12, (5, 9, 15)>
- <16, (6, 2, 14)>
- <17, (18, 7, 14)>
- <17, (18, 10, 7)>
- <17, (18, 14, 7)>
- <17, (7, 14, 18)>
- <17, (7, 18, 10)>
- <17, (7, 10, 18)>
- <17, (14, 18, 7)>
- <17, (10, 18, 7)>
