Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 11) (17, 15) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 9) (16, 15) (16, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

We can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 9, and 11 have three or more neighbors, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [48] \). 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 11)>, <9, (0, 2, 19)>, <11, (3, 7, 13)>
