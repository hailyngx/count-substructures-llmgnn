Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 20) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 15) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 3) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 19) (28, 8) (28, 15) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 28) (8, 15) (9, 25) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 24) (16, 7) (16, 24) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 19) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 23) (1, 19) (1, 25) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 2) (26, 27) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 10) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 10) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 28) (15, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 51 \]

So, there are a total of 51 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ \text{<2, (0, 20, 22)>} \]
\[ \text{<3, (5, 11, 20)>} \]
\[ \text{<4, (13, 10, 23)>} \]
\[ \text{<5, (6, 3, 18)>} \]
\[ \text{<6, (5, 3, 29)>} \]
\[ \text{<7, (13, 18, 21)>} \]
\[ \text{<11, (3, 19, 24)>} \]
\[ \text{<15, (8, 21, 28)>} \]
\[ \text{<19, (1, 24, 29)>} \]
\[ \text{<20, (0, 22, 26)>} \]
\[ \text{<23, (11, 14, 24)>} \]
\[ \text{<27, (2, 10, 26)>} \]
