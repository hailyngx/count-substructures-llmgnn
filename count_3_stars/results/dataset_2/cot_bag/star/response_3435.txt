Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 25) (3, 17) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (27, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 2) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 26) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 29) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 18) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 22) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 20) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 11) (26, 0) (26, 15) (18, 6) (18, 9) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 15) (23, 21) (23, 19) (23, 20) (16, 29) (16, 2) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 19) (11, 24) (11, 9) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (29, 14) (29, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 25) (2, 13) (22, 7) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 21) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Then, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes.

Here are the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors (17, 14, 9)
- Node 2: Neighbors (7, 4, 25, 13, 16)
- Node 4: Neighbors (14, 13, 2)
- Node 5: Neighbors (3, 10, 27, 6)
- Node 6: Neighbors (5, 22, 15, 18)
- Node 7: Neighbors (10, 12, 22, 2)
- Node 8: Neighbors (14, 24, 22)
- Node 9: Neighbors (0, 18, 11)
- Node 10: Neighbors (17, 7, 5)
- Node 14: Neighbors (0, 4, 29, 8)
- Node 15: Neighbors (6, 21, 26, 19)
- Node 21: Neighbors (28, 23, 22, 15)
- Node 22: Neighbors (7, 6, 8, 21)
- Node 24: Neighbors (8, 28, 11)
- Node 28: Neighbors (21, 19, 24, 20)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 43 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43]. 

Unique 3-stars: <0, (17, 14, 9)>, <2, (7, 4, 25)>, <4, (14, 13, 2)>, <5, (3, 10, 27)>, <6, (5, 22, 15)>, <7, (10, 12, 22)>, <8, (14, 24, 22)>, <9, (0, 18, 11)>, <10, (17, 7, 5)>, <14, (0, 29, 8)>, <15, (6, 21, 26)>, <21, (28, 23, 22)>, <22, (7, 8, 6)>, <24, (8, 28, 11)>, <28, (21, 19, 20)>
