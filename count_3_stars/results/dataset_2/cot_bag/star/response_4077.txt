Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now let's analyze the nodes and find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 9, 11 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 11 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 10, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 13 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 12, 13 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 5, 12 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 14 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 10, 11 (3 neighbors)
- Node 10 has neighbors: 3, 9, 13 (3 neighbors)
- Node 11 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9, 12 (4 neighbors)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 6, 7, 11, 13 (4 neighbors)
- Node 13 has neighbors: 6, 10, 12, 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 14 has neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 13 (4 neighbors)

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 61 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [61].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 0, 11>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 10, 13>
<4, 1, 2>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 1, 13>
<5, 3, 8>
<9, 0, 10>
<11, 0, 12>
<12, 6, 13>
<13, 4, 14>
