Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 3) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 19) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 1) (9, 14) (9, 1) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 4, 8, 7, 14  
Node 1: 13, 9  
Node 2: 18, 5, 15  
Node 3: 8, 6  
Node 4: 8, 13, 0, 6  
Node 5: 2, 18  
Node 6: 4, 19, 12, 3  
Node 7: 0, 15  
Node 8: 4, 14, 3, 0  
Node 9: 14, 1  
Node 10: 19  
Node 11: 16, 13, 12  
Node 12: 11, 16, 17, 6  
Node 13: 11, 4, 1  
Node 14: 8, 0, 9, 19  
Node 15: 2, 18, 7  
Node 16: 11, 12, 17  
Node 17: 16, 18, 12  
Node 18: 2, 5, 15, 17  
Node 19: 14, 10, 6  

Node 11, 16, 12, and 13 each have three neighbors, so we can form a 3-star graph around these nodes.  
For Node 11, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For Node 16, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For Node 12, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
For Node 13, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4] \).  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<11, (13, 12, 16)>  
<16, (11, 17, 12)>  
<12, (16, 17, 11)>  
<13, (11, 4, 1)>
