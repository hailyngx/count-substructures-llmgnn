Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 18) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 32

So there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 9, 10)>, <2, (1, 9, 3)>, <2, (1, 9, 10)>, <2, (1, 3, 10)>, <2, (9, 3, 10)>, <3, (0, 13, 16)>, <3, (0, 13, 16)>, <3, (0, 9, 13)>, <3, (6, 11, 19)>, <3, (6, 11, 19)>, <3, (9, 10, 11)>, <3, (9, 10, 19)>, <4, (5, 17, 19)>, <5, (6, 14, 18)>, <6, (2, 11, 19)>, <6, (2, 11, 19)>, <6, (2, 11, 19)>, <6, (2, 3, 11)>, <6, (2, 3, 11)>, <9, (2, 3, 10)>, <14, (12, 15, 18)>, <14, (12, 15, 18)>, <16, (13, 14, 18)>, <19, (4, 11, 15)>
