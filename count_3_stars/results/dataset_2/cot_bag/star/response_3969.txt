Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 6) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 2) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 14) (15, 4) (15, 14) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 11
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 10
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 12
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 15, 16
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 11
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8, 10
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 12, 13
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 13
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 16, 17
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 14
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 12, 15, 19
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 4, 14
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 4, 11
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors: 8, 11
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors: 9, 14

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 10)>, <3, (1, 6, 12)>, <4, (1, 15, 16)>, <5, (1, 7, 10)>, <6, (0, 1, 10)>, <7, (5, 12, 13)>, <10, (1, 5, 13)>, <11, (0, 5, 16)>, <12, (3, 7, 14)>, <14, (12, 15, 19)>
