Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 18) (0, 15) (0, 18) (10, 4) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (2, 7) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are six nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, there are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [27]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (9, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 13, 4)>
<4, (12, 4, 10)>
<4, (12, 4, 13)>
<6, (17, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 5)>
<9, (3, 9, 4)>
<9, (14, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (13, 9, 4)>
<12, (15, 12, 4)>
<12, (14, 12, 4)>
<12, (17, 12, 4)>
<12, (13, 12, 4)>
<12, (4, 12, 13)>
<13, (3, 13, 4)>
<13, (8, 13, 4)>
<13, (12, 13, 4)>
<13, (3, 13, 12)>
