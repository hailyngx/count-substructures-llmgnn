Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We'll then calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 4, 7, 8, 2, 12, 11, 3, 13, 10, 1, and 0.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <6, (9, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 4, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <6, (4, 7, 11)>, <6, (4, 7, 13)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 4)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 12)>, <9, (6, 8, 10)>, <9, (6, 7, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 10)>, <9, (6, 11, 12)>, <9, (7, 11, 13)>, <9, (8, 4, 12)>, <9, (8, 4, 10)>, <9, (10, 11, 12)>, <9, (10, 4, 12)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 11, 13)>

- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <7, (6, 11, 13)>, <7, (6, 4, 8)>, <7, (11, 4, 13)>, <7, (8, 4, 3)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <8, (9, 2, 14)>, <8, (9, 2, 12)>, <8, (9, 2, 1)>, <8, (9, 14, 1)>, <8, (4, 2, 1)>, <8, (4, 2, 14)>, <8, (4, 2, 12)>, <8, (2, 14, 1)>, <8, (2, 14, 3)>, <8, (2, 1, 3)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <2, (8, 12, 14)>, <2, (8, 12, 0)>, <2, (12, 0, 14)>, <2, (12, 0, 11)>

- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <12, (9, 2, 0)>, <12, (9, 2, 11)>, <12, (9, 11, 0)>, <12, (2, 0, 11)>

- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <11, (6, 7, 12)>, <11, (6, 7, 0)>, <11, (6, 12, 0)>, <11, (7, 13, 0)>, <11, (7, 12, 0)>, <11, (12, 0, 5)>, <11, (9, 12, 0)>, <11, (9, 7, 12)>, <11, (9, 7, 13)>, <11, (9, 12, 10)>

- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <3, (4, 14, 10)>, <3, (4, 10, 13)>, <3, (14, 10, 1)>, <3, (14, 13, 1)>

- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <13, (6, 7, 1)>, <13, (6, 7, 3)>, <13, (6, 3, 1)>, <13, (7, 3, 1)>

- For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - 3-star: <10, (9, 3, 1)>

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <1, (8, 14, 13)>, <1, (8, 14, 3)>, <1, (14, 3, 10)>, <1, (14, 13, 10)>

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - 3-stars: <0, (2, 12, 11)>, <0, (2, 12, 5)>, <0, (12, 11, 5)>, <0, (11, 5, 10)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed with each node, we get a total of 65 3-stars in this graph.
So the answer is: [65].
