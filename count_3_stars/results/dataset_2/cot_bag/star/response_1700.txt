Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 6, 7, 1, 2 (degree 4)
- Node 1: neighbors 7, 11, 0, 12, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 2: neighbors 10, 13, 0 (degree 3)
- Node 3: neighbors 5, 4, 7, 13, 14 (degree 5)
- Node 4: neighbors 5, 12, 13, 3, 10 (degree 5)
- Node 5: neighbors 6, 13, 8, 4, 3 (degree 5)
- Node 8: neighbors 5, 7, 11, 14, 1 (degree 5)
- Node 10: neighbors 6, 4, 11, 13, 2, 14 (degree 6)
- Node 13: neighbors 5, 4, 10, 2, 3 (degree 5)
- Node 14: neighbors 9, 10, 3, 8 (degree 4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of 3 or higher:

- Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 14 have a degree of 4 or more, so we will calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Nodes 2 and 13 have a degree of 3, so they will each contribute 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has a degree of 6, so it will contribute \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 7 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 + 1 \times 20 = 48 \]

Hence, there are a total of 48 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing them inside <>:
<0, (6, 7, 1), (6, 7, 2), (6, 1, 2), (7, 1, 2)>
<1, (7, 11, 0), (7, 11, 12), (7, 11, 8), (7, 0, 12), (7, 0, 8), (11, 0, 12), (11, 0, 8), (0, 12, 8)>
<2, (10, 13, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 13), (5, 13, 2), (5, 13, 14), (4, 13, 2), (4, 13, 3), (13, 2, 14), (13, 3, 14), (2, 3, 14)>
<4, (5, 12, 1), (5, 12, 8), (5, 1, 8), (12, 1, 8)>

<8, (5, 7, 11), (5, 7, 14), (5, 11, 14), (7, 11, 14)>
<10, (6, 4, 11), (6, 4, 13), (6, 11, 13), (4, 11, 13)>
<13, (5, 10, 14), (5, 2, 0), (10, 2, 0)>
<14, (10, 3, 8)> 

So the final answer is [48].
