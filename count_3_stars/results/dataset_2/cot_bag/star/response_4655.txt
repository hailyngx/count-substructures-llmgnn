Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 19) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (15, 17) (15, 14) (6, 12) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 17) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more edges connected to them: node 4, node 7, and node 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 3-stars centered at node 4.

For node 7:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 3-stars centered at node 7.

For node 14:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 3-stars centered at node 14.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (0, 5, 19)>
<7, (0, 13, 18)>
<7, (4, 2, 13)>
<7, (2, 13, 17)>
<7, (18, 3, 8)>
<14, (1, 15, 19)>
<14, (2, 15, 16)>
<14, (2, 15, 17)>
<14, (2, 15, 19)>
<14, (2, 16, 17)>
