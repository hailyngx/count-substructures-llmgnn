Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 5) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 18) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (11, 12) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 19) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 8) (1, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (18, 10) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 18) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges.

To find the total number of 3-stars, we check each node that has three or more neighbors. For each such node, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around it.

Node 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 have three or more neighbors, so we calculate the 3-stars around them.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Thus, we have 4 3-stars around node 2.

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Thus, we have 1 3-star around node 4.

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Thus, we have 4 3-stars around node 7.

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Thus, we have 1 3-star around node 9.

For node 10:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Thus, we have 4 3-stars around node 10.

For node 12:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Thus, we have 1 3-star around node 12.

For node 13:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Thus, we have 10 3-stars around node 13.

For node 14:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Thus, we have 4 3-stars around node 14.

For node 15:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Thus, we have 1 3-star around node 15.

For node 16:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Thus, we have 1 3-star around node 16.

For node 17:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Thus, we have 4 3-stars around node 17.

Calculating the total, we have \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35 \) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 13)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>
<10, (5, 14, 17)>
<12, (6, 18, 11)>
<13, (7, 2, 14)>
<14, (2, 13, 17)>
<15, (16, 0, 1)>
<16, (15, 19, 1)>
<17, (14, 2, 10)>
