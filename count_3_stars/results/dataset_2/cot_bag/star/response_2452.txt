Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up. Here are the steps:

1. Nodes with three or more neighbors:
    - Node 5: 5, 9, 1, 4, 7
    - Node 9: 9, 5, 8, 1, 0
    - Node 4: 4, 5, 7, 3, 6, 2
    - Node 7: 7, 5, 4, 0, 3
    - Node 1: 1, 5, 9, 3, 2, 0
    - Node 3: 3, 4, 7, 1, 6
    - Node 6: 6, 4, 3, 8
    - Node 2: 2, 5, 4, 1
    - Node 8: 8, 9, 6, 0
    - Node 0: 0, 9, 7, 1, 8

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
    - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
    \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 102 \)

So, there are 102 3-stars in the given graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars found, we have:
\[ \text{<5, (1, 4, 7)>} \]
\[ \text{<9, (0, 1, 5)>} \]
\[ \text{<4, (2, 6, 7)>} \]
\[ \text{<7, (0, 3, 5)>} \]
\[ \text{<1, (0, 2, 5)>} \]
\[ \text{<6, (3, 4, 8)>} \]
