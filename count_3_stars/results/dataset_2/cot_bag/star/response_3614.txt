Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
       0 -- 1
        \    |
         \   |
          8--6
          | / |
          |/  |
       2--4--5
        \ | /
          7
          |
          3
```

We can see that each of the nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8 has 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the degree of the node.

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 possible 3-stars)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 possible 3-stars)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 possible 3-stars)

Adding these up: \( [0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = [28] \)

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are as follows: 
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
