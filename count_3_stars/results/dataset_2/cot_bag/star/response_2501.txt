Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information. Here is the visualization of the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- 0: {2, 10}
- 1: {12, 15}
- 2: {0, 10, 13, 15}
- 3: {7, 8}
- 4: {13, 18}
- 5: {8}
- 6: {17, 19}
- 7: {3, 8, 13, 14, 19}
- 8: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- 9: {12, 15}
- 10: {0, 2, 16, 18}
- 11: {8, 12, 14}
- 12: {1, 9, 11, 14}
- 13: {4, 7, 2}
- 14: {11, 12, 7, 16}
- 15: {1, 2, 9, 18}
- 16: {10, 14, 17}
- 17: {6, 16}
- 18: {4, 10, 15, 19}
- 19: {6, 7, 18}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19}

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 10, 15)>
- <7, (3, 8, 13)>
- <7, (3, 8, 14)>
- <7, (3, 13, 19)>
- <7, (3, 14, 19)>
- <7, (8, 13, 19)>
- <7, (8, 14, 19)>
- <7, (13, 14, 19)>
- <8, (3, 5, 11)>
- <8, (3, 7, 11)>
- <8, (5, 7, 11)>
- <10, (0, 2, 18)>
- <12, (1, 9, 15)>
- <12, (11, 14, 16)>
- <13, (2, 4, 7)>
- <14, (7, 11, 12)>
- <14, (7, 11, 16)>
- <14, (11, 12, 16)>
- <15, (2, 9, 18)>
- <15, (9, 18, 19)>
- <16, (10, 14, 17)>
- <18, (4, 10, 15)>
- <18, (4, 10, 19)>
- <18, (10, 15, 19)>
