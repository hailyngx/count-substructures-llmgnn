Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) (15, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 7) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 16) (17, 9) (17, 16) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 10, 14, 19
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 14, 16
- Node 3: 0, 5, 13
- Node 4: 8, 13, 14, 19
- Node 5: 2, 3, 11
- Node 6: 9, 14
- Node 7: 2, 7, 10, 11, 12
- Node 8: 4, 18
- Node 9: 6, 9, 17, 18
- Node 10: 1, 7
- Node 11: 5, 7, 14
- Node 12: 7, 16
- Node 13: 3, 4, 18, 19
- Node 14: 1, 2, 4, 6, 11
- Node 15: 16
- Node 16: 2, 12, 15, 17
- Node 17: 9, 16
- Node 18: 8, 9, 13
- Node 19: 1, 4, 13

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (10, 14, 19), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, but none of them are directly connected, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 13), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (8, 13, 14, 19), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (13, 14, 19)>, <4, (8, 14, 19)>, <4, (8, 13, 19)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, but none of them are directly connected, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (6, 17, 18), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (6, 17, 18)>, <9, (6, 9, 17)>, <9, (6, 9, 18)>, <9, (9, 17, 18)>.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (4, 18, 19), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <13, (4, 18, 19)>, <13, (4, 13, 19)>, <13, (4, 13, 18)>, <13, (13, 18, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [14] \). 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (10, 14, 19)>, <3, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (8, 13, 19)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <4, (8, 14, 19)>, <4, (13, 14, 19)>, <9, (6, 17, 18)>, <9, (6, 9, 17)>, <9, (6, 9, 18)>, <9, (9, 17, 18)>, <13, (4, 18, 19)>, <13, (4, 13, 19)>, <13, (4, 13, 18)>, <13, (13, 18, 19)>.
