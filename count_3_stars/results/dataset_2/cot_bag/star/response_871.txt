Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 3) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. From the given list of edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (4, 11, 16, 17) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
2. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 13, 19) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
3. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (2, 0, 19, 3) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
4. Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (7, 15, 19) so the number of 3-stars = 1.
5. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 14, 18) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
6. Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 18, 17) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
7. Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (7, 13, 17) so the number of 3-stars = 1.
8. Node 10: It has 3 neighbors (9, 12, 19) so the number of 3-stars = 1.
9. Node 11: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 12, 13) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
10. Node 13: It has 3 neighbors (3, 11, 8) so the number of 3-stars = 1.
11. Node 15: It has 2 neighbors (1, 5) which is less than 3.
12. Node 16: It has 2 neighbors (0, 9) which is less than 3.
13. Node 17: It has 5 neighbors (0, 6, 9, 18, 8) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
14. Node 19: It has 4 neighbors (5, 10, 4, 3) so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up all the cases where 3-stars can be formed: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-star subgraphs in this graph is [36]. Some of the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 11, 17)>, <3, (2, 6, 19)>, <4, (0, 3, 19)>, <6, (3, 7, 18)>, <7, (5, 8, 18)>, <10, (9, 12, 19)>, <11, (0, 2, 12)>, <13, (3, 8, 11)>, <17, (0, 6, 9)>, <19, (3, 4, 10)>.
