Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1] = [40] \)

Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 7, 5)>
