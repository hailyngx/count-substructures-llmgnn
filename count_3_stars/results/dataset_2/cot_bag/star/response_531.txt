Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 19) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with fewer than 3 neighbors are: 0, 15.

For the remaining nodes, here are their neighbors:
- Node 1: 4, 7, 19
- Node 2: 7, 9, 10, 15
- Node 3: 4, 7, 13
- Node 4: 1, 6, 12, 13
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9, 10, 11
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8, 16
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6, 10, 14, 19
- Node 9: 2, 5, 9, 18
- Node 10: 2, 5, 8, 11
- Node 12: 4, 16, 0
- Node 13: 3, 4, 18
- Node 14: 8, 17
- Node 16: 6, 12
- Node 17: 14, 19
- Node 18: 9, 13, 0
- Node 19: 1, 8, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 3-stars
- Node 2: 6 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 3-stars
- Node 8: 2 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: $3 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (7, 9, 10)>
- <3, (4, 7, 13)>
- <4, (1, 6, 12)>
- <5, (6, 8, 10)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 10, 14)>
- <10, (5, 8, 11)>
- <12, (4, 12, 16)>
- <14, (8, 14, 17)>
- <16, (6, 12, 16)>
- <18, (9, 13, 18)>
- <19, (1, 17, 19)>
