Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 8, 11, 14, 7) 
Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 13, 14, 6, 5) 
Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 7, 6, 9) 
Node 4 (neighbors: 8, 10) 
Node 5 (neighbors: 10, 14, 7, 2, 12) 
Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 3, 14, 7, 2) 
Node 8 (neighbors: 13, 4, 11, 0) 
Node 10 (neighbors: 12, 4, 9, 5) 
Node 12 (neighbors: 13, 10, 11, 5) 
Node 13 (neighbors: 8, 12, 2)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- For node 13:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding the total number of 3-stars together: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 54 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].
