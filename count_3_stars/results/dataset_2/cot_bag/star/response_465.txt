Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 1) (8, 15) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 19) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (12, 1) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 13) (19, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 15, 6, 7, 10, 2, 18, 1, 8, 13, 17, 12, 16, 14, 0, 19.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: No 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 19: No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [49] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (15, 7, 10)>
- <15, (7, 8, 16)>
- <15, (6, 14, 13)>
- <15, (10, 0, 11)>
- <15, (16, 9, 8)>
- <7, (15, 4, 1)>
- <7, (15, 14, 8)>
- <7, (4, 14, 1)>
- <7, (4, 1, 5)>
- <10, (15, 0, 16)>
- <10, (15, 11, 14)>
- <10, (16, 9, 8)>
- <2, (3, 18, 8)>
- <18, (4, 2, 5)>

- <17, (1, 12, 0)>
- <16, (15, 10, 8)>
- <16, (15, 9, 8)>
- <16, (9, 17, 0)>
- <14, (6, 10, 19)>
- <14, (7, 10, 19)>
