Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [46].
