Response:
First, let's build the graph based on the given information. We have 20 nodes numbered from 0 to 19, and the corresponding edges are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 17, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 16, and 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9, 15, and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13 and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 13, and 15.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 16.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 16.
- Node 15 is connected to node 6.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 12, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 10.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 19 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. 
Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 all have 5 neighbors, so each forms 10 3-stars. 

Adding these up gives a total of \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10*9 = 144 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [144]. 

Some unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (3, 9, 15)>
<6, (9, 13, 15)>
<9, (0, 4, 13)>
<1, (4, 8, 18)>
<1, (5, 8, 18)>
<1, (17, 18, 10)>
<2, (0, 8, 17)>
<2, (8, 16, 17)>
<2, (12, 14, 16)>
<3, (4, 5, 18)>
<4, (0, 9, 13)>
<12, (11, 14, 16)>
<13, (7, 9, 10)>
<14, (10, 12, 16)>
<18, (1, 5, 8)>
