Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 103 \) 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [103] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 10)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 10)>
- <0, (4, 7, 10)>
- <1, (0, 7, 10)>
- <7, (0, 1, 10)>
- <10, (0, 1, 7)>
