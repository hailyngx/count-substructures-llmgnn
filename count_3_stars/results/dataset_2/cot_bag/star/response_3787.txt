Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
