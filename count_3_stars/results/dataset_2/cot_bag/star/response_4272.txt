Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
To find the three 3-stars and calculate their total number, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors: 5, 9, 19)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 10, 15, 17)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 5, 13, 17)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 8, 9, 10)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 7, 9, 12)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 2, 9, 13)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 12, 13, 15)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 4, 11, 12)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 18)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 14)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 1, 6, 11)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 17, 18)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 1, 2, 13, 16, 19)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 9, 16, 19)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 0, 17, 18)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 17 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 19 can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [10]

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, 5, 9, 19>
- <1, 10, 15, 17>
- <2, 5, 13, 17>
- <3, 8, 9, 10>
- <4, 7, 9, 12>
- <6, 12, 13, 15>
- <17, 1, 13, 2>
- <19, 0, 17, 18>
