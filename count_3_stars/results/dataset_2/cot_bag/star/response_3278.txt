Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (22, 8) (23, 21) (23, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 24) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 28) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 28) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 21) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 19) (13, 26) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 27) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 27) (4, 21) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 24) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 24) (11, 9) (11, 18) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 2) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (3, 19) (25, 15) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 10) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 25) (21, 23) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 24) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors, as only those nodes can form 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 14, 7, 13)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 17, 7, 16)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 10, 28, 6, 25)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 5, 20, 18, 19)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 23, 29, 25, 2)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 5, 0, 12, 1, 29)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 9, 22, 20, 21)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 18, 27, 2)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 15, 7, 19)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 25, 12, 28)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 1, 28, 27)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 10, 11, 3)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 23, 14, 8, 4, 24)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 17, 27, 29, 21)

Now, we count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 1, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 2, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 3, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 6, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 7, we have 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 8, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 10, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 12, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 15, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 16, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 18, we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For Node 21, we have 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 24, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 42

So, the total number of 3-stars is 42. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 7, 13>, <1, 7, 16>, <1, 7, 17>, <1, 7, 29>, <2, 10, 28>, <2, 6, 25>, <2, 25, 28>, <3, 5, 20>, <3, 18, 19>, <3, 18, 20>, <3, 18, 19>, <6, 23, 29>, <6, 2, 25>, <7, 12, 15>, <8, 20, 21>, <8, 20, 28>, <8, 21, 24>, <8, 9, 22>, <10, 18, 27>, <21, 23, 4>, <21, 24, 27>. 

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets, we have [42].
