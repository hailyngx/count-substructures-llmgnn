Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9, 13
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 13
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 13, 14
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 10, 14
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 13
- Node 8: 1, 7, 10
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7
- Node 10: 1, 5, 8, 14
- Node 11: 1, 7, 12, 14
- Node 12: 11, 13
- Node 13: 0, 3, 4, 7, 12
- Node 14: 1, 4, 5, 10, 11


Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 15 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 15 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 15 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 15 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59\).

Therefore, there are [59] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 13)>
- <1, (2, 10, 14)>
- <3, (2, 7, 13)>
- <4, (5, 7, 14)>
- <7, (8, 11, 13)>
- <10, (1, 5, 14)>
- <11, (12, 14, 1)>
- <13, (0, 3, 4)>
- <14, (1, 4, 5)>
