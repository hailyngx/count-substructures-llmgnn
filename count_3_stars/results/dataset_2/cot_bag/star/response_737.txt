Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (19, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 7) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 2) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 2
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 2
- Node 19: 1

We will now look for the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5, Node 13, and Node 15 have 3 neighbors each, so they each form 1 unique 3-star:
   - <5, (0, 10, 12)>
   - <13, (15, 18, 19)>
   - <15, (3, 14, 17)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars: [3].
