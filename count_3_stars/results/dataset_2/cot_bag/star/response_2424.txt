Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
1: 0, 8, 9, 3  
2: 4, 3, 5, 9  
3: 2, 9, 1, 5, 7  
4: 7, 0, 6, 2  
5: 2, 3   
6: 4, 8, 9, 0  
7: 4, 0, 3, 8, 9  
8: 6, 1, 7  
9: 7, 6, 2, 3, 1  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the above information:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6.  
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.  

Adding them up: 

\[ [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [38] \]

The unique 3-stars are:  
<3, (2, 1, 5)>  
<3, (2, 1, 7)>  
<3, (2, 1, 9)>  
<3, (2, 5, 7)>  
<3, (2, 5, 9)>  
<4, (7, 6, 0)>  
<4, (7, 6, 2)>  
<6, (4, 8, 0)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  
<7, (4, 3, 8)>  
<7, (4, 3, 9)>  
<7, (0, 3, 8)>  
<7, (0, 3, 9)>  
<9, (2, 1, 5)>  
<9, (2, 1, 3)>  
<9, (2, 5, 1)>  
<9, (2, 5, 3)>
