Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Let's list the nodes with their degree:

- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 5

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 82

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [82].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (9, 10, 13)>
<3, (8, 11, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 13)>
<5, (4, 6, 10)>
<6, (5, 13, 7)>
<8, (9, 13, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<12, (10, 11, 6)>
<13, (5, 8, 9)>
