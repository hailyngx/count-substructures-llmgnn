Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 16) (10, 3) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 2
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 2, 18
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 11, 6, 12
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 10, 19
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 16, 8, 0
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 9
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 19, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 17, 15, 14, 13
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 7, 18, 15
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 11, 6, 19
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 3, 17, 2, 12
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 7, 14, 5, 12
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 9, 19, 15, 5, 0
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 6, 14
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3, 13
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 17, 15, 12
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: 16, 3
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 4, 12

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the contributions: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<7, (17, 14, 15)>
<19, (3, 17, 12)>
<15, (7, 14, 5)>
<12, (9, 19, 0)>
