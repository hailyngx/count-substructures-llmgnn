Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 15) (21, 29) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 21) (15, 3) (15, 9) (18, 23) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 16) (22, 24) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 5) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 25) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 4) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 20) (19, 13) (19, 23) (19, 9) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 12) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 11) (27, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (12, 4) (12, 9) (25, 17) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 5) (7, 1) (7, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 11) (8, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 24) (24, 22) (24, 9) (6, 10) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <1, (7, 12, 21)>, <1, (7, 12, 28)>, <1, (7, 21, 28)>, <1, (12, 21, 28)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <3, (11, 15, 27)>, <3, (11, 15, 28)>, <3, (11, 27, 28)>, <3, (15, 27, 28)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <15, (9, 21, 23)>, <15, (9, 21, 28)>, <15, (9, 23, 28)>, <15, (21, 23, 28)>

- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <18, (23, 28, 29)>, <18, (23, 28, 18)>, <18, (23, 18, 29)>, <18, (28, 18, 29)>

- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <21, (15, 21, 29)>, <21, (15, 21, 28)>, <21, (15, 29, 28)>, <21, (21, 28, 29)>

- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <23, (7, 12, 18)>, <23, (7, 12, 23)>, <23, (7, 18, 23)>, <23, (12, 18, 23)>

- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <25, (0, 5, 14)>, <25, (0, 5, 17)>, <25, (0, 14, 17)>, <25, (5, 14, 17)>

- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <27, (4, 11, 27)>, <27, (4, 11, 3)>, <27, (4, 3, 27)>, <27, (11, 3, 27)>

- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <28, (3, 21, 29)>, <28, (3, 15, 21)>, <28, (3, 21, 29)>, <28, (15, 21, 29)>

- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <29, (18, 20, 21)>, <29, (18, 20, 4)>, <29, (18, 21, 4)>, <29, (20, 21, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
