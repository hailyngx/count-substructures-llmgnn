Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than 3 neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

1. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 9, 11, 0, 3, 14
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 14)>, <5, (9, 3, 14)>, <5, (0, 3, 14)>, <5, (9, 11, 0)>, <5, (9, 11, 3)>, <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <5, (0, 3, 11)>, <5, (3, 11, 14)>, <5, (0, 11, 14)>

2. Node 9:
   - Neighbors: 5, 14, 10, 13, 0
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 10, 13)>, <9, (5, 10, 0)>, <9, (5, 13, 0)>, <9, (5, 14, 10)>, <9, (5, 14, 13)>, <9, (5, 14, 0)>, <9, (10, 13, 0)>, <9, (10, 14, 13)>, <9, (10, 14, 0)>, <9, (13, 14, 0)>

3. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 14, 7, 2, 8
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <6, (14, 7, 2)>, <6, (14, 7, 8)>, <6, (14, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>

4. Node 11:
   - Neighbors: 5, 1, 3, 10, 4
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <11, (5, 1, 3)>, <11, (5, 1, 4)>, <11, (5, 3, 4)>, <11, (5, 10, 1)>, <11, (5, 10, 3)>, <11, (5, 10, 4)>, <11, (1, 3, 4)>, <11, (1, 10, 3)>, <11, (1, 10, 4)>, <11, (3, 10, 4)>

5. Node 4:
   - Neighbors: 11, 8, 13
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <4, (11, 8, 13)>

6. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 6, 4, 14, 12
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (6, 14, 12)>, <8, (6, 14, 4)>, <8, (6, 12, 4)>, <8, (14, 12, 4)>

7. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 5, 11, 7, 14
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 14)>, <3, (5, 11, 7)>, <3, (5, 11, 14)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>

8. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 13
   - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 13)>, <0, (5, 9, 13)>, <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (7, 9, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is: [43].
