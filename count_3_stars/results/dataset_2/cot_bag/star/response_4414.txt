Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars.  
\[ 48 \]
