Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 4 neighbors, node 3 has 5 neighbors, node 4 has 4 neighbors, node 5 has 4 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, node 7 has 4 neighbors, node 8 has 5 neighbors, and node 9 has 4 neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 0:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 1:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 3:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- For node 4:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 5:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 6:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- For node 7:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 8:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- For node 9:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
