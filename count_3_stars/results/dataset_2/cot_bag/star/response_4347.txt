Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 70

Therefore, the final answer is [70].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 12, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <2, (6, 11, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 12)>, <4, (0, 10, 12)>, <8, (1, 13, 14)>
