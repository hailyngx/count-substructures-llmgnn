Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 13. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40 \)

So, there are a total of 40 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 9, 12>, <1, 12, 3>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 14>, <3, 5, 12>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 10, 0>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 12, 2>, <4, 14, 2>, <8, 0, 10>, <8, 0, 11>, <8, 0, 13>, <8, 3, 9>, <10, 13, 2>, <11, 0, 8>, <13, 2, 4>, <13, 2, 14>, <13, 8, 3>, <13, 8, 2>, <12, 1, 3>, <12, 1, 9>, <12, 2, 4>, <12, 2, 6>, <10, 4, 14>, <6, 3, 12>, <2, 12, 14>, <0, 8, 13>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 14, 10>, <0, 10, 11>, <6, 7, 14>, <4, 9, 8>, <0, 11, 13>, <7, 6, 14>. 
There are a total of 36 unique 3-stars. So the final answer is [40].
