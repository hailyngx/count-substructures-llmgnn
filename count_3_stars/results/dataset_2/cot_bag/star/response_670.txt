Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
This graph has a total of 15 nodes with the described edges. Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, hence 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, therefore 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, leading to 1 3-star.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, resulting in 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, hence 10 3-stars.
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, giving 4 3-stars.
- Node 10: 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
- Node 11: 5 neighbors, leading to 10 3-stars.
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars.
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, hence 4 3-stars.
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star.

Adding these up:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 59 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in this graph.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 13)>, <0, (1, 8, 13)>, <0, (4, 8, 13)>, 
<1, (0, 4, 13)>, <1, (0, 8, 13)>, <1, (4, 8, 13)>,
<2, (7, 10, 14)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, 
<3, (6, 9, 11)>,
<4, (0, 1, 13)>, 
<5, (7, 10, 14)>,
<6, (3, 9, 11)>,
<7, (2, 5, 10)>, <7, (2, 12, 14)>, <7, (5, 12, 14)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 13)>,
<9, (3, 6, 11)>,
<10, (2, 7, 14)>, <10, (5, 7, 14)>, 
<11, (3, 6, 9)>, <11, (6, 9, 12)>, <11, (9, 12, 13)>, 
<12, (2, 10, 14)>, 
<13, (0, 1, 4)>, <13, (0, 1, 8)>, <13, (4, 12, 0)>, 
<14, (2, 7, 10)>, <14, (5, 7, 10)>, <14, (10, 12, 2)>.
