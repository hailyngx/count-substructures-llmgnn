Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 12) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 8) (21, 29) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 22) (22, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 5) (29, 21) (29, 10) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 16) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 6) (14, 27) (14, 23) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 5) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 11) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 10) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 15) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 12) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 28) (13, 0) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes will form the center of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 5: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 15: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 18: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 19: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 24: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29: There are 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54]. The unique 3-stars are listed below:

<5, (0, 7, 13)>
<5, (7, 13, 27)>
<5, (13, 0, 27)>
<5, (20, 15, 18)>
<5, (20, 15, 22)>
<7, (0, 13, 27)>

<10, (8, 12, 29)>
<19, (7, 8, 19)>
<25, (5, 7, 25)>
<25, (5, 20, 25)>
<25, (5, 17, 25)>
<25, (5, 25, 28)>
<26, (1, 9, 26)>
<27, (14, 23, 27)>
<28, (3, 5, 28)>
<28, (5, 24, 28)>
