Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (7, 11) (7, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 7) (0, 15) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, there are 34 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 7, 16)>, <1, (6, 7, 16)>, <1, (4, 16, 6)>, <1, (4, 16, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 16)>, <4, (1, 7, 16)>, <4, (6, 7, 16)>, <5, (13, 14, 19)>, <5, (13, 14, 15)>, <5, (13, 14, 10)>, <6, (1, 10, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 13)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 8, 16)>, <10, (6, 13, 14)>, <13, (5, 10, 14)>, <15, (0, 14, 18)>, <16, (1, 4, 6)>, <16, (4, 8, 16)>, <17, (11, 13, 18)>, <18, (15, 17, 19)> 

Therefore, the final result is [34].
