Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 16) (14, 18) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 16, Node 17, and Node 12 have three or more neighbors.

Now let's apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
6. Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <3, 5, 16>
- <5, 3, 1>
