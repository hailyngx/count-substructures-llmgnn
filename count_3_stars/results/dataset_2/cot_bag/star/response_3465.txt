Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 16, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 3)>
<4, (3, 12, 4)>
<6, (0, 10, 6)>
<7, (5, 15, 7)>
<8, (14, 16, 8)>
<9, (0, 17, 9)>
<10, (1, 18, 10)>
<12, (4, 14, 12)>
<14, (2, 8, 14)>
<16, (2, 18, 16)>
<18, (10, 12, 18)>
<19, (17, 16, 19)>
