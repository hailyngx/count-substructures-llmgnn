Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 2 <0, (5, 9, 1)> <0, (5, 9, 2)> <0, (5, 1, 2)> <0, (9, 1, 2)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 3, 2, 0 <1, (5, 7, 3)> <1, (5, 7, 2)> <1, (5, 7, 0)> <1, (5, 3, 2)> <1, (5, 3, 0)> <1, (5, 2, 0)> <1, (7, 3, 2)> <1, (7, 3, 0)> <1, (7, 2, 0)> <1, (3, 2, 0)> (10 3-stars)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 1, 8, 0 <2, (4, 1, 8)> <2, (4, 1, 0)> <2, (4, 8, 0)> <2, (1, 8, 0)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 8 <3, (5, 9, 1)> <3, (5, 9, 8)> <3, (5, 1, 8)> <3, (9, 1, 8)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, 2 <4, (9, 7, 2)> (1 3-star)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 8, 1, 0, 3 <5, (8, 1, 0)> <5, (8, 1, 3)> <5, (8, 0, 3)> <5, (1, 0, 3)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 1, 6 <7, (9, 4, 1)> <7, (9, 4, 6)> <7, (9, 1, 6)> <7, (4, 1, 6)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 2, 6 <8, (5, 9, 3)> <8, (5, 9, 2)> <8, (5, 9, 6)> <8, (5, 3, 2)> <8, (5, 3, 6)> <8, (5, 2, 6)> <8, (9, 3, 2)> <8, (9, 3, 6)> <8, (9, 2, 6)> <8, (3, 2, 6)> (10 3-stars)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 8, 4, 3, 7, 0 <9, (8, 4, 3)> <9, (8, 4, 7)> <9, (8, 4, 0)> <9, (8, 3, 7)> <9, (8, 3, 0)> <9, (8, 7, 0)> <9, (4, 3, 7)> <9, (4, 3, 0)> <9, (4, 7, 0)> <9, (3, 7, 0)> (10 3-stars)

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [47] \]

Therefore, there are 47 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<0, (5, 9, 1)> <0, (5, 9, 2)> <0, (5, 1, 2)> <0, (9, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)> <1, (5, 7, 2)> <1, (5, 7, 0)> <1, (5, 3, 2)> <1, (5, 3, 0)> <1, (5, 2, 0)> <1, (7, 3, 2)> <1, (7, 3, 0)> <1, (7, 2, 0)> <1, (3, 2, 0)>
<2, (4, 1, 8)> <2, (4, 1, 0)> <2, (4, 8, 0)> <2, (1, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)> <3, (5, 9, 8)> <3, (5, 1, 8)> <3, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)> <5, (8, 1, 3)> <5, (8, 0, 3)> <5, (1, 0, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)> <7, (9, 4, 6)> <7, (9, 1, 6)> <7, (4, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)> <8, (5, 9, 2)> <8, (5, 9, 6)> <8, (5, 3, 2)> <8, (5, 3, 6)> <8, (5, 2, 6)> <8, (9, 3, 2)> <8, (9, 3, 6)> <8, (9, 2, 6)> <8, (3, 2, 6)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)> <9, (8, 4, 7)> <9, (8, 4, 0)> <9, (8, 3, 7)> <9, (8, 3, 0)> <9, (8, 7, 0)> <9, (4, 3, 7)> <9, (4, 3, 0)> <9, (4, 7, 0)> <9, (3, 7, 0)>
