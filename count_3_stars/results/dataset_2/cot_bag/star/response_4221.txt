Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5, 4, 8, 7
Node 1: 9, 3, 4
Node 2: 5, 6, 3, 7
Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 2
Node 4: 5, 1, 3, 0
Node 5: 9, 2, 4, 0, 7
Node 6: 9, 2, 8
Node 7: 5, 0, 9, 3, 2
Node 8: 9, 6, 0
Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 9: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 10 = 20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 2)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
