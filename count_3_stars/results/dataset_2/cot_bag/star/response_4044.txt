Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 14) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 29) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 2) (1, 7) (1, 22) (1, 16) (26, 22) (26, 8) (5, 17) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 27) (14, 21) (14, 0) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 25) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 19) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 2) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 25) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 27) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 29) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 25) (4, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 17) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 17) (27, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 24) (29, 11) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 29) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 
   - Inom{1}{3} = 1

- For nodes with 4 or more neighbors:
   - Inom{5}{3} + Inom{4}{3} + Inom{4}{3} + Inom{5}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{4}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{2}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{5}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{3}{3} + Inom{5}{3} + Inom{4}{3} + Inom{2}{3} + Inom{3}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Some of the unique 3-stars found include: 
- <0, (7, 12, 22)>
- <2, (4, 9, 10)>
- <4, (2, 9, 25)>
- <6, (11, 17, 28)>
- <7, (0, 1, 22)>
- <8, (3, 19, 26)>
- <10, (4, 15, 25)>
- <11, (6, 17, 29)>
- <17, (11, 25, 27)>
- <19, (6, 8, 25)>
- <22, (0, 1, 2)>
- <24, (12, 29, 30)>
- <25, (4, 10, 17)>
