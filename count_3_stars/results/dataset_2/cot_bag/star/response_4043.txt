Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 9) = 44

So, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, 
<2, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 1, 4>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 2, 9>, <8, 5, 6>, 
<8, 7, 6>, <8, 3, 6>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 0, 6>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 4, 6>, 
<9, 2, 6>, <9, 1, 6>
