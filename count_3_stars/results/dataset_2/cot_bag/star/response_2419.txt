Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
Since there are 15 nodes in the graph, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0: (4, 13, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 1: (9, 10, 11) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 2: (3, 7, 12) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 3: (2, 4, 14) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 4: (0, 11, 13) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 5: No 3-star (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 6: (11, 12, 7) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 7: (2, 6, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 8: No 3-star (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 9: (1, 7, 13) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 10: No 3-star (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 11: (1, 4, 6) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 12: (2, 5, 13) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 13: (0, 4, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 14: (3, 4, 12) - Forms 1 3-star

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 13>
<1, 9, 10>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 2, 4>
<4, 0, 13>
<6, 11, 12>
<7, 2, 6>
<9, 1, 7>
<11, 1, 4>
<12, 2, 5>
<13, 0, 4>
<14, 3, 12>
