Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 25) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 29) (4, 18) (17, 20) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 17) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 25) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (23, 20) (23, 2) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 14) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 1) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 11) (24, 22) (24, 17) (24, 2) (12, 18) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 12) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 10) (1, 22) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 24) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: node 3, node 5, and node 22. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 11, 25)>
- <3, (5, 15, 19)>
- <3, (5, 6, 29)>
- <3, (11, 15, 25)>
- <5, (3, 6, 29)>
- <5, (3, 15, 19)>
- <5, (6, 14, 29)>
- <5, (14, 15, 26)>
- <22, (1, 2, 24)>
- <22, (1, 14, 24)>
- <22, (2, 12, 24)>
- <22, (2, 24, 28)>
