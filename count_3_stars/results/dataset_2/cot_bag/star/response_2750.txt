Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 2) (17, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 4) (15, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 15) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {18, 11, 15}
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {18, 11, 6, 1}
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {11, 16, 14}
4. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {8, 19, 5}
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {3, 17, 12, 6}
6. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {11, 19, 16, 14, 9}
7. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {5, 10, 12}
8. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {13, 7, 12}
9. Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {8, 13, 1, 14}
10. Node 11 has 5 neighbors: {3, 0, 7, 1, 4}
11. Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {8, 19, 6, 14, 9}
12. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {2, 10, 9}
13. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: {7, 10, 12, 4}
14. Node 16 has 2 neighbors: {7, 4}
15. Node 17 has 2 neighbors: {2, 6}
16. Node 18 has 2 neighbors: {0, 3}
17. Node 19 has 2 neighbors: {5, 7}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 3: [4]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [6]
- Node 7: [10]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [4]
- Node 11: [10]
- Node 12: [10]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [4]

Summing up all the 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 49

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (11, 18, 15)>
<3, (6, 11, 1)>
<4, (11, 16, 14)>
<5, (8, 19, 5)>
<6, (3, 17, 12)>
<7, (11, 19, 16)>
<8, (12, 10, 5)>
<9, (7, 13, 9)>
<10, (1, 14, 13)>
<11, (4, 12, 7)>
