Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 18) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 14) (15, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, and 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
6. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 57 \).
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 12)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 13)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <1, (10, 12, 9)>, <1, (10, 13, 14)>, <1, (13, 3, 11)>, <1, (13, 3, 12)>, <1, (13, 11, 12)>, <1, (13, 11, 17)>, <2, (3, 18, 7)>, <2, (7, 16, 17)>, <3, (11, 13, 17)>, <9, (10, 12, 1)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 10, 12)>, <9, (4, 1, 12)>, <12, (10, 13, 14)>, <13, (11, 3, 12)>
