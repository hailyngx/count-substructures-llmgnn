Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 23) (18, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (3, 17) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 12) (25, 10) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 27) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 4) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 28) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 12) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 27) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 5) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 10) (10, 25) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 23) (11, 20) (11, 29) (27, 1) (27, 5) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 13) (24, 0) (24, 21) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 23) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 7) (23, 13) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: 14, 17, 20, and 29.

For node 14:
- 3-star: <14, (15, 17, 22)>

For node 17:
- 3-star: <17, (3, 16, 23)>

For node 20:
- 3-star: <20, (0, 7, 29)>

For node 29:
- 3-star: <29, (9, 20, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
