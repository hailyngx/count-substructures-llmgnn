Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:  4, 7, 8, 13, 5, 6, 3, 11, 0, 9, 10, 14, 2, and 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms 5 3-stars (1, 6, 11), (1, 14, 6), (1, 11, 14), (11, 6, 14), (14, 6, 1)

For node 7:
- Node 7 forms no 3-stars since it only has 2 neighbors.

For node 8:
- Node 8 forms 5 3-stars (5, 3, 6), (3, 6, 8), (5, 6, 12), (3, 8, 13), (5, 8, 6)

For node 13:
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star (10, 6, 13)

For node 5:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star (14, 12, 5)

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars (12, 5, 6), (10, 13, 6), (4, 11, 6)

For node 3:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star (11, 2, 3)

For node 11:
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star (12, 5, 11)

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms no 3-stars since it only has 2 neighbors.

For node 9:
- Node 9 forms no 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.

For node 10:
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star (2, 14, 10)

For node 14:
- Node 14 forms no 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.

For node 2:
- Node 2 forms no 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.

For node 12:
- Node 12 forms 10 3-stars (13, 6, 12), (5, 11, 12), (6, 12, 14), (6, 12, 11), (5, 12, 14), (13, 12, 9), (14, 12, 2), (5, 12, 6), (11, 12, 6), (12, 14, 2)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 5 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 10 = 22
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars formed are: 
<1, 6, 11>, <1, 14, 6>, <1, 11, 14>, <11, 6, 14>, <14, 6, 1>, 
<5, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 12>, <3, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 6>, 
<10, 6, 13>, 
<14, 12, 5>, 
<12, 5, 6>, <10, 13, 6>, <4, 11, 6>, 
<11, 2, 3>, 
<12, 5, 11>, 
<2, 14, 10>, 
<13, 6, 12>, <5, 11, 12>, <6, 12, 14>, <6, 12, 11>, <5, 12, 14>, <13, 12, 9>, <14, 12, 2>, <5, 12, 6>, <11, 12, 6>, <12, 14, 2>.
