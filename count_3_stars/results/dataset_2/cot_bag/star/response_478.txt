Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (15, 2, 18)>
<2, (17, 2, 18)>
<2, (15, 1, 18)>
<2, (15, 2, 17)>
<4, (9, 4, 10)>
<9, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (2, 9, 4)>
<9, (9, 4, 13)>
<13, (7, 13, 12)>
<13, (7, 13, 9)>
<13, (12, 13, 9)>
<16, (8, 16, 17)>
<16, (16, 5, 17)>
<16, (8, 16, 5)>
<16, (8, 16, 17)>
<17, (16, 17, 6)>
<17, (6, 17, 16)>
<17, (6, 17, 16)>
<17, (17, 19, 16)>
<19, (10, 19, 4)>
<19, (8, 19, 10)>
<19, (8, 19, 17)>
<19, (19, 8, 10)>
