Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

      5----2
       \  /|
        \/ |
       9--8
       |  /|\
       | / | \
       |/--7--1
       |/  | /
       4---3
        \  | 
         \ |
          \0
          
Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 63

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63]. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
