Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 10) (10, 17) (10, 0) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 18) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 0) (25, 24) (23, 14) (23, 24) (23, 28) (23, 27) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 19) (28, 11) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 23) (27, 4) (27, 21) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 24) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 3) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 20) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 29) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (6, 22) (6, 15) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 5) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 2) (5, 12) (5, 21) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 12) (22, 6) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 1) (15, 11) (15, 28) (15, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 24) (19, 12) (19, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 20, 25, 23, 12, 28, 4, 27, 9, 29, 0, 3, 2, 21, 13, 5, 18, 24, 15, and 1.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only one 3-star with this node as the center)
- For node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars we get: \(4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 66 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <11, (16, 28, 15)>, <16, (11, 18, 4)>, <20, (25, 26, 4)>, <25, (20, 0, 24)>, <23, (14, 24, 28)>, <12, (7, 21, 22)>, <12, (7, 3, 19)>, <12, (21, 27, 5)>, <12, (22, 6, 15)>, <28, (11, 23, 19)>, <4, (16, 20, 27)>, <4, (1, 27, 23)>, <4, (20, 27, 1)>, <27, (4, 21, 23)>, <9, (11, 2, 24)>, <29, (13, 18, 2)>, <2, (9, 3, 13)>, <2, (24, 3, 1)>, <21, (12, 27, 5)>, <13, (20, 29, 2)>, <18, (16, 20, 29)>, <24, (25, 23, 9)>, <15, (11, 6, 28)>, <1, (4, 0, 24)>.

This covers all possible unique 3-stars in the given graph.
