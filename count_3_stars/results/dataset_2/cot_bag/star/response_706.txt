Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
The nodes which have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 80

Hence, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in this graph.
