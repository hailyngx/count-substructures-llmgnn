Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 20, 22, 23, 26, 28, and 29.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (15, 1), (1, 15), (1, 26). There is 1 unique 3-star: <1, (15, 26, 9)>.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3, 12), (3, 11), (3, 0), (3, 24), (3, 22). There are 10 unique 3-stars: <3, (12, 11, 24)>, <3, (12, 11, 22)>, <3, (12, 0, 24)>, <3, (12, 0, 22)>, <3, (11, 24, 22)>, <3, (11, 0, 24)>, <3, (11, 0, 22)>, <3, (24, 0, 22)>, <3, (12, 11, 0)>, <3, (12, 24, 22)>.
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 26), (4, 0), (4, 19). There is 1 unique 3-star: <4, (26, 0, 19)>.
4. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.
5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 16), (7, 8). There are 6 unique 3-stars: <7, (11, 10, 16)>, <7, (11, 10, 8)>, <7, (11, 16, 8)>, <7, (10, 16, 8)>, <7, (11, 10, 16)>, <7, (11, 16, 8)>.

11. Node 20 has 5 neighbors: (20, 2), (20, 29), (20, 14), (20, 5), (20, 10). There are 10 unique 3-stars: <20, (2, 29, 14)>, <20, (2, 29, 5)>, <20, (2, 29, 10)>, <20, (2, 14, 5)>, <20, (2, 14, 10)>, <20, (2, 5, 10)>, <20, (29, 14, 5)>, <20, (29, 14, 10)>, <20, (29, 5, 10)>, <20, (14, 5, 10)>.
12. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: (22, 14), (22, 3), (22, 16), (22, 24). There are 6 unique 3-stars: <22, (14, 3, 16)>, <22, (14, 3, 24)>, <22, (14, 16, 24)>, <22, (3, 16, 24)>, <22, (14, 3, 16)>, <22, (14, 16, 24)>.
13. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: (23, 17), (23, 16), (23, 18). There is 1 unique 3-star: <23, (17, 16, 18)>.
14. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: (26, 15), (26, 29), (26, 1), (26, 4). There are 6 unique 3-stars: <26, (15, 29, 1)>, <26, (15, 29, 4)>, <26, (15, 1, 4)>, <26, (29, 1, 4)>, <26, (15, 29, 1)>, <26, (15, 1, 4)>.
15. Node 28 has 4 neighbors: (28, 6), (28, 14), (28, 0), (28, 18). There are 6 unique 3-stars: <28, (6, 14, 0)>, <28, (6, 14, 18)>, <28, (6, 0, 18)>, <28, (14, 0, 18)>, <28, (6, 14, 0)>, <28, (6, 0, 18)>.
16. Node 29 has 5 neighbors: (29, 2), (29, 20), (29, 26), (29, 14), (29, 28). There are 10 unique 3-stars: <29, (2, 20, 26)>, <29, (2, 20, 14)>, <29, (2, 20, 28)>, <29, (2, 26, 14)>, <29, (2, 26, 28)>, <29, (2, 14, 28)>, <29, (20, 26, 14)>, <29, (20, 26, 28)>, <29, (20, 14, 28)>, <29, (26, 14, 28)>.

Now, 
\[[] = 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 10\]
\[[] = 59\]

Therefore, there are 59 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
