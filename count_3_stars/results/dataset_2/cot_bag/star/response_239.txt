Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 16) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 15) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 2) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we observe that some nodes have 3 neighbors, indicating the potential formation of 3-stars. Let's identify those nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars and list them.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34 \]

So, there are 34 3-stars in this graph. Listing them once:
\[ <0, (3, 7, 12)>, <2, (12, 14, 19)>, <3, (0, 10, 8)>, <4, (10, 11, 15)>, <5, (8, 7, 13)>, <7, (0, 19, 5)>, <8, (3, 7, 4)>, <10, (1, 13, 4)>, <12, (2, 0, 14)>, <13, (10, 2, 15)>, <15, (13, 4, 16)>, <16, (15, 6, 4)>, <17, (1, 18, 19)>, <19, (17, 7, 2)> \]

The final answer is [34].
