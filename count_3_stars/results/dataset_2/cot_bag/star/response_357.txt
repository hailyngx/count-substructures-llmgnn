Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 6, and 9.

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
    - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 7)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
    - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 5)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
    - <6, (1, 4, 9)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
    - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <9, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 1)>
    - <9, (2, 6, 1)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 6, 1)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 1)>
    - <9, (2, 6, 3)>
    - <9, (2, 0, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 31.
