Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: has 4 neighbors
- Node 2: has 6 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors
- Node 10: has 3 neighbors
- Node 11: has 4 neighbors
- Node 12: has 4 neighbors
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors
- Node 14: has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 7, 14)>
- <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- <5, (10, 11, 14)>
- <6, (4, 7, 14)>
- <9, (3, 13, 14)>
- <12, (5, 6, 13)>
