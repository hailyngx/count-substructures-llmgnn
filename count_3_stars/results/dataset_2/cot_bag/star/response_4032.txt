Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 6) (22, 1) (2, 26) (2, 15) (29, 13) (29, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 29) (17, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 3) (26, 8) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 1) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 26) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 25) (7, 13) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 22) (6, 14) (6, 24) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 21) (11, 14) (11, 20) (1, 22) (1, 28) (1, 12) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 27) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 21) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 5) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 23) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 27) (0, 19) (21, 24) (21, 5) (21, 12) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 20) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 16) (4, 25) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 13, 14, 15, 22, 24, 25, 26, 5, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: 1
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: 1
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: 1
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<13, 7, 29>
<14, 6, 24>
<14, 11, 20>
<14, 17, 29>
<15, 2, 10>
<15, 9, 25>
<22, 1, 28>
<24, 6, 27>
<24, 14, 21>
<26, 2, 15>
<26, 3, 18>
<26, 8, 28>
<5, 8, 21>
<9, 15, 28>
<9, 16, 19>
<9, 19, 28>
