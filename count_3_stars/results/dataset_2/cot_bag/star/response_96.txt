Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7)
  Number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 4)
  Number of 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4)
  Number of 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 0)
  Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7)
  Number of 3-stars for node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4)
  Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8)
  Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 7)
  Number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0)
  Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 3, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 5)>
- <1, (3, 8, 4)>
- <1, (5, 6, 4)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 4)>
- <3, (1, 9, 4)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (6, 4, 5)>
- <9, (6, 8, 3)>
- <9, (6, 8, 1)>
- <9, (6, 8, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
