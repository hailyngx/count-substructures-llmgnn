Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are:  
- Node 0 with neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 11  
- Node 3 with neighbors: 1, 7, 10, 12, 14  
- Node 4 with neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9, 13  
- Node 6 with neighbors: 1, 4, 9, 11, 14  
- Node 7 with neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 10  
- Node 9 with neighbors: 4, 6, 13  
- Node 11 with neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 12  
- Node 12 with neighbors: 3, 10, 11  
- Node 14 with neighbors: 3, 6, 8  

Following the method described earlier, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Adding all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 50 unique 3-stars in the graph.  
Thus, the final answer is [50].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
