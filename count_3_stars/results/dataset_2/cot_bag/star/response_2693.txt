Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 9, and 3 nodes with 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 1, and 4 nodes with 3 neighbors: 6, 2, 8, 0. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For the nodes with 5 neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For the nodes with 4 neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 6: No 3-stars since it needs at least 3 additional neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-stars since it needs at least 2 additional neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-stars since it needs at least 2 additional neighbors.
- Node 0: No 3-stars since it needs at least 2 additional neighbors.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 29 \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 0)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (4, 1, 7)>, <5, (4, 1, 8)>, <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <5, (7, 0, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 0, 8)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <1, (7, 3, 8)>.

So, the final answer is: \[29\].
