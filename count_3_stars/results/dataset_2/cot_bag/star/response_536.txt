Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be numbered from 0 to 14. To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 78 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [78]. Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

- <1, (3, 5, 11)>
- <3, (1, 5, 14)>
- <5, (3, 11, 12)>
- <7, (11, 6, 9)>
- <10, (0, 2, 6)>
- <11, (1, 7, 13)>
- <13, (1, 9, 11)>
