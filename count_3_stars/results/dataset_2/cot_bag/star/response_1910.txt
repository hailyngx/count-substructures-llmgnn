Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   9 -- 2          1
   |   / | \      / \
   |  /  |  \    /   \
   1 0   |   7- 6     5
    \    |  /    \   / \
     \   | /      \ /   \
       4-3         8    
```

Following the construction steps outlined earlier:

1. Node 0: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
2. Node 3: has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
3. Node 5: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
4. Node 7: has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
5. Node 9: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
