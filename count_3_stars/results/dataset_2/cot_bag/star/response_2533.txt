Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {9, 2, 0, 3}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 1, 1}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 3}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {4, 0, 2, 1}
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 3, 6, 2}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {5, 4, 1, 6}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 2, 0}
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {5, 7, 1, 8, 6}
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 6, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44 \). Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
