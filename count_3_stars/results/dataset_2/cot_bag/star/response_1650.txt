Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: This node has 4 neighbors (6, 4, 8, 7).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (6, 4, 8)>, <0, (6, 4, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 7)>

For node 2: This node has 4 neighbors (9, 8, 5, 7).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (9, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 8, 7)>, <2, (9, 5, 7)>

For node 4: This node has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 8, 0).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (9, 3, 8)>, <4, (9, 3, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>

For node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (6, 1, 8, 2).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 8, 2)>

For node 6: This node has 4 neighbors (5, 1, 8, 0).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>

For node 7: This node has 4 neighbors (9, 1, 5, 2).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (9, 1, 5)>, <7, (9, 1, 2)>, <7, (9, 5, 2)>

For node 8: This node has 6 neighbors (6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<8, (6, 3, 4)>, <8, (6, 3, 2)>, <8, (6, 3, 5)>, <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 5)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 4, 2)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>

For node 9: This node has 4 neighbors (4, 2, 3, 7).
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 44 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]
