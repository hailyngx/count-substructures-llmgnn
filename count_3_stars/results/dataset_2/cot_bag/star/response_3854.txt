Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes can be numbered from 0 to 14. Let's go ahead and find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: Degree = 5
- Node 1: Degree = 2
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 3: Degree = 5
- Node 4: Degree = 4
- Node 5: Degree = 5
- Node 6: Degree = 4
- Node 7: Degree = 5
- Node 8: Degree = 6
- Node 9: Degree = 6
- Node 10: Degree = 4
- Node 11: Degree = 3
- Node 12: Degree = 2
- Node 13: Degree = 3
- Node 14: Degree = 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree >=3:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 13, 14 (0 3-star for each)
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 10 (4C3 = 4 3-stars)
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13 (5C3 = 10 3-stars)
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: 5 (6C3 = 20 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: [0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [34]

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (8, 10, 6)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 9, 13)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <10, (0, 8, 9)>
- <13, (5, 9, 2)>
- <14, (9, 3, 7)>
