Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which we'll focus on to find the 3-stars. Let's evaluate each of these nodes:

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (5, 7, 3, 12). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (2, 11, 14, 0, 12). So, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 9 as the center.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (13, 4, 10, 12, 7). So, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 8 as the center.  
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (8, 1, 14, 0). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 13 as the center.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (8, 11, 5, 2). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (6, 11, 10, 2). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center.  
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (9, 13, 10, 3). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.  
Node 10 has 4 neighbors: (8, 5, 0, 3). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 10 as the center.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0, 14, 2). So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.  
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: (9, 13, 3, 1, 7). So, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 14 as the center.  

Adding up all the cases where 3-stars are formed gives:
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (2, 11, 14)>
<8, (13, 4, 10)>
<13, (8, 1, 14)>
<4, (8, 11, 5)>
<5, (6, 11, 10)>
<0, (9, 13, 10)>
<10, (8, 5, 0)>
<3, (6, 0, 14)>
<14, (9, 13, 3)>
