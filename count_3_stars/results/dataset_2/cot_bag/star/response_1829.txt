Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 neighbors. So, there are [4] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5 neighbors. So, there are [10] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4: There are 2 choose 3 = 0 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 2 neighbors. So, there are [0] = 0 3-stars.
- Node 5: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose 3 neighbors out of 3 neighbors. So, there are [1] = 1 3-star. It forms the 3-star <5, 0, 13>.
- Node 7: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 neighbors. So, there are [4] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 neighbors. So, there are [4] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 6 neighbors. So, there are [20] = 20 3-stars.

In total, there are [4 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [43] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: <5, 0, 13>, <0, 5, 13>, <2, 7, 13>, <7, 2, 13>, <2, 6, 13>, <6, 2, 13>, <7, 0, 13>, <0, 7, 13>, <2, 13, 0>, <13, 2, 0>, <11, 5, 8>, <5, 11, 8>, <11, 8, 5>, <8, 11, 5>, <11, 7, 0>, <7, 11, 0>, <11, 8, 14>, <8, 11, 14>, <11, 14, 8>, <14, 11, 8>.
