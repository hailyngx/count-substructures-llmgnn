Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (14, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 18) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 31\)

Therefore, there are 31 unique 3-stars in this graph, which we can list as follows:
<[5, (3, 6, 11)>, <5, (3, 10, 11)>, <5, (4, 6, 11)>, <5, (10, 11, 6)>, <5, (10, 11, 4)>, <5, (4, 10, 11)>, <6, (3, 5, 11)>, <6, (3, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 10, 4)>, <8, (2, 9, 16)>, <10, (3, 5, 11)>, <13, (1, 11, 19)>, <15, (1, 12, 15)>, <16, (1, 16, 19)>, <16, (8, 9, 16)>, <16, (1, 16, 19)>, <18, (0, 4, 18)>, <18, (4, 7, 18)>, <18, (4, 19, 18)>, <18, (7, 19, 18)>, <19, (9, 13, 19)>, <19, (9, 16, 19)>, <19, (1, 13, 19)>, <19, (13, 16, 19)>, <19, (1, 16, 19)>]
