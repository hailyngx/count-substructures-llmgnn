Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 13) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 24) (21, 20) (21, 25) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 14) (7, 25) (7, 18) (7, 26) (25, 17) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 27) (19, 9) (19, 28) (13, 29) (13, 27) (26, 5) (26, 7) (26, 23) (0, 10) (0, 22) (10, 1) (10, 0) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 2) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 6) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 12) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 0) (22, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 23) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 27) (27, 8) (27, 13) (27, 18) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with at least three neighbors. Then, we count the 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Let's go through each of these nodes to count the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 2 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 2 3-stars
- Node 17: 2 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars
- Node 22: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 24: 1 3-star
- Node 25: 2 3-stars
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 28: 0 3-stars
- Node 29: 0 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 18.

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, 17, 25>, <4, 11, 24>, <4, 2, 14>, <15, 8, 27>, <16, 9, 28>, <16, 9, 29>, <17, 1, 15>, <17, 6, 25>, <22, 0, 10>, <23, 1, 6>, <23, 6, 12>, <24, 11, 4>, <25, 14, 22>, <25, 7, 17>, <26, 5, 7>, <26, 5, 23>, <27, 13, 18>, <27, 18, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
