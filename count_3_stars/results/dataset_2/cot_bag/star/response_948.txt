Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 2) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 24) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 5) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 15) (14, 21) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 4) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 27) (18, 29) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 6) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 3) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 3) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 5) (24, 23) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 20) (6, 19) (6, 27) (27, 17) (27, 16) (27, 6) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 5) (20, 3) (15, 13) (15, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 2) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 22) (3, 20) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 7, 21, 29, 28, 11, 4, 22, 0, 25, 5, 19, and 16.

For node 7, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
For node 21, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 29, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 28, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
For node 11, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 22, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 0, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
For node 25, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 19, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 16, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Summing these up, we have a total of [45] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<7, (2, 16, 26)>, <7, (2, 17, 29)>, <7, (2, 29, 25)>, <7, (16, 0, 27)>, <7, (16, 27, 6)>, <7, (29, 17, 27)>, <21, (12, 14, 26)>, <29, (17, 25, 13)>, <29, (25, 2, 13)>, <28, (10, 13, 15)>, <11, (0, 5, 20)>, <11, (23, 0, 5)>, <11, (23, 24, 12)>, <4, (9, 22, 3)>, <22, (19, 4, 3)>, <25, (2, 15, 13)>, <5, (0, 10, 20)>, <5, (0, 11, 10)>, <5, (11, 20, 3)>, <19, (18, 22, 3)>
