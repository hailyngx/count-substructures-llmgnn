Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 10) (5, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (15, 19) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 14) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3}  = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \]

So, there are a total of 50 3-stars in the given graph, indicated by the brackets [50].
