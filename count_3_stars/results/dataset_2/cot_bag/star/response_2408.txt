Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (21, 25) (21, 29) (6, 15) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 27) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 11) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 2) (20, 26) (20, 27) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 22) (24, 23) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 19) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 19) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 20) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 20) (14, 28) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 18) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 24) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 7, 13, 15, and 27.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (15, 16, 18)>, <7, (11, 21, 25)>, <13, (8, 26, 27)>, <15, (4, 6, 18)>, <27, (3, 5, 20)>.
