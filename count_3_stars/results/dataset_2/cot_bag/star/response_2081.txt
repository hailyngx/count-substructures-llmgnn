Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 2, 3, 14, 13, 5, 11, 12. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 102.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [102]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (8, 9, 13)>, <8, (4, 9, 12)>, <0, (7, 9, 11)>, <7, (0, 13, 14)>, <9, (0, 4, 13)>, <2, (7, 12, 14)>, 
<3, (4, 8, 2)>, <14, (7, 13, 2)>, <13, (4, 7, 14)>, <5, (7, 11, 3)>, <11, (4, 0, 6)>, <12, (8, 2, 5)>.
