Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 11, 5, 16, 15, 2
- Node 1: 10, 5, 9
- Node 2: 10, 11, 5, 0
- Node 3: 7, 17, 4
- Node 4: 17, 15, 3
- Node 5: 13, 2, 1, 17, 0
- Node 6: 18
- Node 7: 8, 12, 3
- Node 8: 19, 14, 7
- Node 9: 12, 1
- Node 10: 12, 1, 2, 14
- Node 11: 19, 0, 2
- Node 12: 10, 7, 9
- Node 13: 5, 18
- Node 14: 8, 10
- Node 15: 19, 0, 4
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 5, 3, 4
- Node 18: 13, 19, 6
- Node 19: 8, 11, 18, 15

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (11, 5, 16)>
- <0, (11, 5, 15)>
- <0, (11, 5, 2)>
- <0, (5, 16, 15)>
- <0, (5, 16, 2)>
- <0, (5, 15, 2)>
- <2, (10, 11, 0)>
- <2, (10, 11, 5)>
- <2, (10, 0, 5)>
- <2, (11, 5, 0)>
- <5, (13, 2, 17)>
- <5, (13, 1, 17)>
- <5, (13, 0, 17)>
- <5, (2, 1, 0)>
- <5, (2, 1, 17)>
- <5, (2, 0, 17)>
- <7, (8, 12, 3)>
- <10, (12, 1, 9)>
- <18, (13, 19, 6)>
- <19, (8, 11, 18)>
- <19, (8, 11, 15)>
- <19, (8, 18, 15)>
- <19, (11, 18, 15)>
