Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Let's go through each node one by one:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 9, 7, 8, 13, 14. It can form 5 3-stars: <2, (9, 7, 8)>, <2, (9, 7, 13)>, <2, (9, 7, 14)>, <2, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (7, 13, 14)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 0, 14, 10. It can form 4 3-stars: <3, (5, 0, 14)>, <3, (5, 14, 10)>, <3, (0, 14, 10)>, <3, (14, 10, 12)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, 14. It forms 1 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 14)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 10, 7. It forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 10, 7)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 11, 12. It can form 4 3-stars: <6, (7, 8, 11)>, <6, (7, 11, 12)>, <6, (8, 11, 12)>, <6, (7, 8, 12)>.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 6, 2, 1, 8. It can form 7 3-stars: <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 2, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (9, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 1, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 13, 2, 10, 6. It can form 4 3-stars: <8, (13, 2, 10)>, <8, (2, 10, 6)>, <8, (10, 6, 12)>, <8, (6, 11, 12)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 2, 10, 7. It can form 4 3-stars: <9, (4, 2, 10)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (10, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 5, 3, 8, 0, 12. It can form 5 3-stars: <10, (5, 3, 8)>, <10, (5, 3, 0)>, <10, (5, 3, 12)>, <10, (8, 0, 11)>, <10, (8, 6, 12)>.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 9, 3, 6, 10. It can form 4 3-stars: <12, (9, 3, 6)>, <12, (9, 3, 10)>, <12, (9, 6, 10)>, <12, (3, 6, 10)>.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 2. It forms 1 3-star: <13, (1, 8, 2)>.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 11. It can form 4 3-stars: <14, (4, 3, 2)>, <14, (4, 3, 11)>, <14, (4, 2, 11)>, <14, (3, 2, 11)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
5 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 7 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) + 5 (from node 10) + 4 (from node 12) + 1 (from node 13) + 4 (from node 14) = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].
