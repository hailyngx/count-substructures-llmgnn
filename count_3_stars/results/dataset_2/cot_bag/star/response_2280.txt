Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 2), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 1)

Next, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, we will check if it has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 2) (4 neighbors) -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 8) (3 neighbors) -> 3 3-stars
Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0) (5 neighbors) -> 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2) (4 neighbors) -> 4 3-stars
Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 2) (5 neighbors) -> 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7) (5 neighbors) -> 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 0) (3 neighbors) -> 3 3-stars
Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2) (4 neighbors) -> 4 3-stars
Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2) (4 neighbors) -> 4 3-stars
Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 1) (3 neighbors) -> 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 3 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 55
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>
