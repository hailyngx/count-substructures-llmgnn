Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes connected to node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
The nodes connected to node 9: 0, 1, 8
The nodes connected to node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
The nodes connected to node 3: 2, 4
The nodes connected to node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
The nodes connected to node 8: 4, 6, 9
The nodes connected to node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
The nodes connected to node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5
The nodes connected to node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
The nodes connected to node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-star structures:

Node 6 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
Total 2 3-stars

Node 9 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
Total 1 3-star

Node 1 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
Total 3 3-stars

Node 4 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
Total 5 3-stars

Node 5 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 5, 7)>
Total 2 3-stars

Node 0 forms 3-star(s) with: 
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
Total 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
