Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 nodes that have three or more neighbors in the given graph. Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 3, 2)>

2. Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
   <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>

3. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
   <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <1, (3, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 0)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 4, 0)>

4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
   <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 5)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 4)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 5)>

5. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
   <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <8, (6, 9, 4)>, <8, (6, 9, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 4)>, <8, (6, 1, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 5)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>, <8, (9, 1, 5)>, <8, (9, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 9, 1, 4)>

6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, resulting in 10 3-stars.
   <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 8)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node gives a total of [60] unique 3-stars.
