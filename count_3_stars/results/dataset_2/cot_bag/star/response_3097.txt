Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34\)
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 1)>
<7, (0, 4, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
