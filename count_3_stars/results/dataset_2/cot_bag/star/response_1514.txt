Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
Let's go through each node to see which nodes are connected to it:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 13, 7, 10
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 3, 5, 4, 12
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 12
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 13
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 10, 14
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 11
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 14
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 13, 11
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 4, 14, 0
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 0, 12, 5
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 13
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 1, 13, 2, 10
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 12, 4, 11, 0
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 5

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 67

So, the total number of 3-stars is [67], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 12>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 5, 12>
<1, 5, 13>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 9, 13>
<5, 7, 14>
<6, 8, 11>
<8, 9, 13>
