Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 5 or more neighbors: {5, 9, 4, 8, 3, 0}. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with those nodes: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 0 = 60 \]

Thus, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<9, (1, 4, 8)>  
<4, (0, 5, 8)>  
<8, (2, 4, 6)>  
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
