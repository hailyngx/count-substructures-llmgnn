Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: {1, 5, 2, 8}
Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 6, 9, 0, 8}
Node 2 has neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 9, 0}
Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 6, 5}
Node 4 has neighbors: {7, 9}
Node 5 has neighbors: {7, 3, 2, 0}
Node 6 has neighbors: {1, 3, 2, 8}
Node 7 has neighbors: {4, 9, 8, 5}
Node 8 has neighbors: {7, 1, 6, 2, 0}
Node 9 has neighbors: {4, 7, 1, 2}

Now, let's compute the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 3, 0)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<8, (7, 1, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
