Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 19) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 13) (27, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 3) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (12, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 4) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 4) (28, 3) (28, 23) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 17) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 22) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 24) (7, 25) (7, 3) (10, 20) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 25) (2, 21) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 4) (29, 1) (29, 13) (29, 23) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 29) (23, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 20) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 29) (13, 23) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 17) (22, 21) 

Response:
There are 22 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using each of these nodes:

1. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <6, (27, 9, 1)>, <6, (27, 9, 14)>, <6, (27, 1, 9)>, <6, (27, 14, 9)>
2. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <9, (6, 23, 24)>, <9, (6, 23, 3)>, <9, (6, 24, 5)>, <9, (6, 24, 17)>
3. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <13, (16, 15, 23)>, <13, (16, 23, 29)>, <13, (15, 23, 29)>, <13, (15, 23, 28)>
4. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <14, (11, 6, 26)>, <14, (11, 6, 4)>, <14, (11, 26, 4)>, <14, (6, 26, 4)>
5. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <15, (27, 23, 13)>, <15, (27, 23, 29)>, <15, (27, 13, 23)>, <15, (27, 13, 16)>
6. Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <16, (11, 19, 13)>, <16, (11, 19, 15)>, <16, (11, 13, 15)>, <16, (11, 13, 29)>
7. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <17, (0, 3, 24)>, <17, (0, 4, 24)>, <17, (0, 3, 17)>, <17, (0, 4, 17)>
8. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <21, (12, 2, 22)>, <21, (12, 2, 25)>, <21, (12, 22, 2)>, <21, (2, 25, 22)>
9. Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <23, (15, 29, 13)>, <23, (15, 29, 28)>, <23, (15, 13, 29)>, <23, (15, 13, 28)>
10. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <25, (20, 7, 2)>, <25, (20, 7, 25)>, <25, (20, 2, 7)>, <25, (7, 2, 25)>
11. Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <27, (11, 15, 20)>, <27, (11, 15, 6)>, <27, (11, 20, 15)>, <27, (15, 6, 20)>
12. Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <29, (1, 23, 13)>, <29, (1, 23, 15)>, <29, (1, 13, 23)>, <29, (1, 13, 15)>
