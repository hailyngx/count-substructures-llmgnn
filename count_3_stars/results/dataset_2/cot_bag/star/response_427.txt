Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (0, 25) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 7) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 29) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 9) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (13, 21) (13, 20) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 29) (23, 6) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 10) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 26) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 0) (4, 24) (12, 22) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (19, 2) (19, 16) (19, 27) (27, 22) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 20) (24, 4) (24, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 8, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: [1]
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{12} 1 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 8, 20)>
<3, (25, 0, 28)>
<8, (0, 2, 15)>
<11, (1, 23, 29)>
<16, (14, 18, 19)>
<18, (2, 16, 22)>
<20, (0, 13, 24)>
<22, (3, 18, 27)>
<23, (6, 10, 15)>
<24, (4, 10, 21)>
<26, (15, 28, 29)>
<28, (3, 9, 26)>
<29, (9, 11, 26)>
