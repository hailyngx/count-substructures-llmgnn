Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 24) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 28) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 5) (26, 8) (26, 22) (9, 16) (9, 12) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 4) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 17) (28, 3) (28, 23) (28, 0) (28, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 10) (2, 27) (2, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 19) (10, 29) (10, 4) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 25) (17, 22) (17, 11) (17, 27) (17, 2) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: node 3, node 15, and node 22. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 3:
There are 4 edges incident on node 3, and hence we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 3 as the central node are: <3, (1, 16, 21)>, <3, (1, 16, 28)>, <3, (1, 21, 28)>, <3, (16, 21, 28)>.

For node 15:
There are 4 edges incident on node 15, and hence we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 15 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 15 as the central node are: <15, (21, 19, 11)>, <15, (21, 19, 12)>, <15, (21, 19, 6)>, <15, (19, 11, 12)>.

For node 22:
There are 5 edges incident on node 22, and hence we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 22 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 22 as the central node are: <22, (23, 18, 26)>, <22, (23, 18, 27)>, <22, (23, 26, 27)>, <22, (18, 26, 27)>, <22, (23, 18, 17)>, <22, (23, 26, 17)>, <22, (18, 26, 17)>, <22, (23, 27, 17)>, <22, (18, 27, 17)>, <22, (26, 27, 17)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10 = 18], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (1, 16, 21)>, <3, (1, 16, 28)>, <3, (1, 21, 28)>, <3, (16, 21, 28)>, <15, (21, 19, 11)>, <15, (21, 19, 12)>, <15, (21, 19, 6)>, <15, (19, 11, 12)>, <22, (23, 18, 26)>, <22, (23, 18, 27)>, <22, (23, 26, 27)>, <22, (18, 26, 27)>, <22, (23, 18, 17)>, <22, (23, 26, 17)>, <22, (18, 26, 17)>, <22, (23, 27, 17)>, <22, (18, 27, 17)>, <22, (26, 27, 17)>.
