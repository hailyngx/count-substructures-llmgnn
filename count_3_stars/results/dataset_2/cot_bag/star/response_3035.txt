Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 14, and the edges are listed accordingly. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 11, 12
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 12
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 10, 12, 13
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 13, 14
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14
Node 12 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12
Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 84 \]

So, there are a total of 84 3-stars in the graph. Writing down the unique 3-stars:
\[ [84] \]
