Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
We will first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to identify potential 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node.

For node 0: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 2: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4: There are 3 neighbors, so there is only one 3-star.

For node 5: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>

<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
