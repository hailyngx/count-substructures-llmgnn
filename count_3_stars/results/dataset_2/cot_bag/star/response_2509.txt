Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 6) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 8) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 27) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 25) (8, 29) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 13) (26, 22) (26, 6) (15, 9) (15, 24) (20, 24) (19, 21) (19, 9) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 4) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 10) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 24) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 16) (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 6) (0, 23) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 4) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 23) (10, 25) (10, 18) (10, 24) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 0) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors {9, 23, 28, 4}.
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 17, 22}.
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 25, 28}.
- Node 5 has neighbors {2, 18, 24}.
- Node 6 has neighbors {13, 14, 16, 26}.
- Node 7 has neighbors {8, 25, 29}.
- Node 8 has neighbors {7, 12, 18, 23, 29}.
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 15, 19}.
- Node 10 has neighbors {18, 23, 24, 25}.
- Node 13 has neighbors {6, 16, 21, 23}.
- Node 14 has neighbors {6, 18, 22}.
- Node 16 has neighbors {6, 11, 13, 17}.
- Node 18 has neighbors {5, 8, 10, 14}.
- Node 22 has neighbors {1, 14, 26}.
- Node 24 has neighbors {5, 10, 15, 20}.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 9, 28)>, <0, (4, 9, 23)>, <0, (9, 23, 28)>, <0, (4, 23, 28)>.
- Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <1, (3, 17, 22)>.
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <4, (0, 25, 28)>.
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <5, (2, 18, 24)>.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <9, (0, 15, 19)>.
- Node 16 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <16, (6, 11, 13)>, <16, (6, 13, 17)>, <16, (11, 13, 17)>, <16, (6, 13, 21)>.
- Node 18 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <18, (5, 8, 10)>, <18, (5, 10, 24)>, <18, (8, 10, 24)>, <18, (8, 10, 25)>.
- Node 22 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. The unique 3-star is <22, (1, 14, 26)>.
- Node 24 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are <24, (5, 10, 15)>, <24, (5, 10, 20)>, <24, (10, 15, 20)>, <24, (10, 15, 24)>.

Adding up all the different 3-stars, we have a total of [20] unique 3-stars.
