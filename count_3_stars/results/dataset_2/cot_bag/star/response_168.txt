Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 5) (8, 2) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 19) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 3, 7
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 19, 9, 13
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 10, 1, 12
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 18, 16
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 8, 19, 14, 15
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 11, 14, 13
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 17, 16, 19
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 5, 12, 0, 13
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 2, 19, 14
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 11, 2, 12, 15, 7
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 10, 18, 19
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, 15
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 11, 4, 9, 16

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes 10, 11, 17, 18, 12, 15, 19, 7, 14, and 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2 and 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6 and 8: 0 3-stars
- For nodes 4, 1, 0, and 3: 0 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <10, (17, 3, 7)>
- <11, (19, 9, 13)>
- <17, (10, 1, 12)>
- <18, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 8, 16)>
- <2, (8, 19, 15)>
- <16, (5, 12, 13)>
- <19, (11, 2, 15)>
- <7, (10, 18, 19)>
- <13, (11, 9, 16)>
