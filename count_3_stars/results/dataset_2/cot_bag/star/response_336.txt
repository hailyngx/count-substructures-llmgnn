Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 21) (3, 21) (25, 19) (25, 14) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 29) (23, 22) (23, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 16) (4, 23) (4, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (5, 16) (13, 29) (13, 27) (13, 18) (26, 29) (26, 4) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 26) (14, 10) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 6) (7, 28) (15, 0) (15, 17) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 20) (1, 16) (20, 27) (20, 1) (9, 16) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (18, 13) (18, 11) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2, node 6, and node 26.

For node 2:
- Connected to nodes 12, 14, and 11.
- 3-stars: <2, (12, 14, 11)>

For node 6:
- Connected to nodes 12, 28, 17, 7, and 26.
- 3-stars: <6, (12, 28, 26)>, <6, (12, 28, 7)>, <6, (12, 26, 7)>, <6, (28, 26, 7)>

For node 26:
- Connected to nodes 29, 4, 6, 28, and 14.
- 3-stars: <26, (29, 4, 6)>, <26, (29, 4, 28)>, <26, (29, 6, 28)>, <26, (4, 6, 14)>, <26, (4, 6, 28)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) + 5 (from node 26) = 10.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
