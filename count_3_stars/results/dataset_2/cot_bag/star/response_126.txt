Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 13) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 26) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (12, 27) (12, 20) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 0) (28, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (3, 9) (3, 6) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 7) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 10) (0, 8) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (20, 12) (20, 16) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 25) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 19) (25, 15) (25, 2) (25, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 14, 17, 27, 4, 8, 29, 11, 5, 13, 3, 21, 2, 22, 6, 7, 1, 20, 19, 18, 23, 16.

Let's calculate the possible 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 26: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 14: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 17: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 27: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 8: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 29: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 11: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 13: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 3: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 21: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 22: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 1: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 20: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 18: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 23: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 16: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the possible 3-stars formed, we get: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [72]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
