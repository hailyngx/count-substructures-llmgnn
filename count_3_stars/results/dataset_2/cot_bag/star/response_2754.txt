Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 9, 26, 15, 27, 14, 17, 1, 21, 10, 2, 13, 3, 7, 4, 23, 13, 14, 6, 20, 28, and 16.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

\[
\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 = 81
\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [81].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<9, 26, 13>, <9, 26, 14>, <9, 26, 1>, <9, 26, 12>, <9, 26, 23>, <15, 1, 12>, <15, 1, 13>, <15, 1, 29>, <15, 12, 13>, <15, 16, 22>, <27, 4, 11>, <14, 17, 10>, <17, 10, 21>, <14, 17, 2>, <0, 7, 18>, <13, 26, 14>, <13, 26, 1>, <13, 26, 12>, <13, 26, 23>, <3, 14, 16>, <3, 14, 5>, <3, 14, 29>, <7, 9, 18>, <4, 27, 11>, <23, 27, 6>, <8, 20, 22>, <19, 9, 29>, <29, 3, 19>, <12, 15, 13>, <12, 15, 29>, <12, 1, 13>, <12, 1, 29>, <24, 11, 4>, <28, 14, 4>, <28, 14, 25>, <6, 10, 11>, <6, 11, 23>, <20, 18, 8>, <25, 26, 28>, <5, 3, 16>, <16, 22, 20>.
