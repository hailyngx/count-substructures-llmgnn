Response:
Applying the guidelines mentioned earlier to this graph:

1. Node 15 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 26, 0). So, it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
2. Node 27 has 3 neighbors (nodes 10, 2, 5). So, it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (nodes 28, 7). So, it does not form any 3-star.
4. Node 22 has 3 neighbors (nodes 23, 9, 25). So it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
5. Node 23 has 4 neighbors (nodes 22, 18, 4, 29). So it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:

    - <19, (6, 11, 24)>
    - <19, (6, 11, 13)>
    - <19, (6, 24, 13)>
    - <19, (11, 24, 13)>
22. Node 14 has 1 neighbor (node 12). So, it does not form any 3-star.
23. Node 25 has 2 neighbors (nodes 22, 11). So, it does not form any 3-star.

    - <12, (26, 6, 14)>
    - <12, (26, 6, 13)>
    - <12, (26, 14, 13)>
    - <12, (6, 14, 13)>
27. Node 13 has 4 neighbors (nodes 11, 19, 18, 12). So it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:

    - <13, (11, 18, 12)>
    - <13, (19, 18, 12)>
28. Node 4 has 5 neighbors (nodes 23, 17, 16, 29, 24). So it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars:

    - <4, (23, 17, 29)>
    - <4, (23, 17, 24)>

29. Node 24 has 3 neighbors (nodes 21, 19, 4). So, it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
30. Node 8 has 2 neighbors (nodes 26, 18). So, it does not form any 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
