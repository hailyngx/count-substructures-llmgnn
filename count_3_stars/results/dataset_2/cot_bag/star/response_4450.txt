Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can construct it as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {1, 3, 8}
- 1: {0, 6, 9}
- 2: {4, 6, 8, 9}
- 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- 4: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- 5: {3, 7}
- 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 10 + 10 = 40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
