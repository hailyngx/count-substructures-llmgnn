Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 0: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<2, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 4: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<4, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 5: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 6: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<6, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 9: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Adding up all the 3-stars for these nodes gives us a total of \(4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15\) 3-stars in total. Hence, the answer is [15].
