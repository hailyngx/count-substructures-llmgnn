Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors (6, 8, 9, 4, 12, 11)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (6, 9, 12, 2, 7)
- Node 2: 6 neighbors (5, 6, 9, 1, 3, 7)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (6, 13, 12, 2, 10)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (12, 0, 14, 11)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (6, 2, 8)
- Node 6: 6 neighbors (5, 1, 3, 0, 2, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (8, 1, 2, 10)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (5, 0, 7)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 10, 1, 0)
- Node 10: 4 neighbors (13, 9, 3, 7)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (4, 0, 14)
- Node 12: 6 neighbors (13, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (12, 3, 10, 1)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (4, 11)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 104 \]

Therefore, there are a total of [104] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 12, 11)>
- <0, (12, 3, 13)>
- <0, (4, 12, 11)>
- <0, (4, 12, 13)>
- <1, (6, 2, 7)>
- <1, (6, 12, 2)>
- <1, (9, 2, 10)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (12, 3, 13)>
- <3, (6, 13, 12)>
- <4, (0, 12, 11)>
- <6, (5, 2, 7)>
- <6, (12, 7, 1)>
- <6, (12, 3, 13)>
- <12, (4, 0, 11)>
- <12, (13, 3, 10)>
