Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 22) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 6) (14, 23) (14, 9) (14, 21) (17, 6) (17, 8) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 13) (26, 1) (26, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 25) (5, 19) (5, 29) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 24) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 10) (22, 27) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 6) (24, 11) (24, 21) (24, 8) (0, 13) (23, 14) (23, 20) (16, 4) (16, 18) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 9) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 21) (8, 24) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
By examining the provided edges, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges: 
- 0: {13} 
- 1: {6, 26, 27} 
- 2: {6, 9} 
- 4: {7, 13, 16, 18, 22} 
- 5: {19, 29} 
- 6: {1, 2, 17, 22} 
- 7: {4, 22} 
- 8: {17, 21, 24, 28, 29} 
- 9: {2, 9, 14, 18, 25} 
- 10: {11, 12, 15} 
- 11: {10, 13, 24, 28} 
- 12: {10} 
- 13: {0, 4, 11, 19, 27} 
- 14: {9, 21, 23} 
- 15: {10, 20, 27} 
- 16: {4} 
- 17: {6, 8} 
- 18: {4, 9, 16} 
- 19: {13, 19, 26} 
- 20: {15, 20, 23, 28, 29} 
- 21: {8, 14, 21, 24} 
- 22: {4, 6, 7, 22} 
- 23: {14, 20} 
- 24: {11, 21, 24, 8} 
- 25: {9, 19, 28} 
- 26: {1, 19} 
- 27: {1, 13, 15, 22} 
- 28: {11, 20, 25, 8} 
- 29: {5, 8, 20}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [70] \]

So, there are 70 unique 3-stars in the graph.
