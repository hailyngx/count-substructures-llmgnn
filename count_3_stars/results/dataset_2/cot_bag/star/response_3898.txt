Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

1: 11, 14, 0  
2: 9, 3, 7, 4   
3: 5, 6, 2, 13, 14   
4: 5, 2, 13, 0   
5: 13, 4, 3, 7   
6: 3, 12   
7: 5, 2, 14, 9   
8: 10, 11, 0   
9: 10, 2, 14, 7   
10: 8, 13, 9, 14   
11: 1, 0, 8, 12   
12: 11, 6, 0   
13: 10, 5, 4, 3, 0   
14: 10, 3, 1, 7, 9   

Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 14 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up gives a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.  

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<10, (8, 11, 0)>  
<10, (9, 14, 7)>  
<10, (13, 5, 4)>  
<10, (14, 1, 7)>  
<13, (10, 5, 4)>  
<13, (10, 9, 14)>  
<13, (5, 3, 14)>  
<13, (5, 4, 0)>  
<13, (0, 11, 8)>  
<14, (10, 9, 7)>  
<14, (10, 1, 7)>  
<14, (3, 5, 7)>  
<14, (1, 11, 0)>
