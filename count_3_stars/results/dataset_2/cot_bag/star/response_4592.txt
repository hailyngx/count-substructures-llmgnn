Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors first:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors.

Now, using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4+1+4+1+1+4+1+1+1+1+4+1+1+4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 10)>
<3, (7, 12, 15)>
<4, (0, 11, 16)>
<6, (9, 11, 15)>
<7, (2, 9, 15)>
<9, (0, 7, 19)>
<10, (0, 1, 14)>
<12, (3, 16, 19)>
<13, (1, 4, 19)>
<14, (5, 10, 17)>
<15, (6, 8, 18)>
<16, (2, 4, 12)>
<18, (11, 15, 19)>
<19, (8, 12, 13)>
