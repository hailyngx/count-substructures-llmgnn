Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: 
  - (11, 6), (11, 12), (16, 7), (16, 15), (3, 1), (15, 16), (15, 2), (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 17), 
  - (5, 0), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 18), (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 18), (1, 7), (2, 15), (2, 8), 
  - (2, 14), (8, 2), (8, 17), (8, 6), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 13), (18, 9), (18, 1), (18, 19), 
  - (18, 17), (18, 13), (19, 18), (19, 10), (19, 6), (7, 16), (7, 5), (7, 1), (14, 2), 
  - (14, 4), (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 6), (4, 17), (12, 11), (12, 0), (10, 1), (10, 19), (10, 13), 
  - (6, 11), (6, 8), (6, 19), (6, 4), (13, 0), (13, 18), (13, 10), (17, 5), (17, 8), (17, 18), (17, 4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node. 

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: {9, 4, 7, 0, 17, 1}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {3, 10, 18, 7}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {15, 8, 14}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {5, 14, 6, 17}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: {11, 8, 19, 4}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {2, 17, 6}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {1, 19, 13}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: 1

- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: {6}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center: 0

- Node 12 has 2 neighbors: {11}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: 0

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {0, 18, 10}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 13 as the center: 1

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {16, 2}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 15 as the center: 1

- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: {7, 15}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 16 as the center: 0

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {5, 8, 18, 4}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center: 4

- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {9, 1, 19, 17, 13}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 18 as the center: 10

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {18, 10, 6}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 19 as the center: 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 46. 

Therefore, the final answer is [46]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 17, 0)>, <5, (9, 17, 1)>, <5, (9, 17, 7)>, <5, (4, 17, 7)>, <5, (4, 17, 0)>, <5, (4, 17, 1)>, <5, (4, 7, 1)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (3, 10, 18)>, <2, (15, 14, 8)>, <4, (5, 17, 14)>, <4, (5, 17, 6)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (11, 8, 19)>, <6, (11, 4, 8)>, <6, (11, 4, 19)>, <6, (8, 4, 19)>, <8, (2, 17, 6)>, <10, (1, 19, 13)>, <13, (0, 18, 10)>, <15, (16, 2, 15)>, <17, (5, 18, 4)>, <17, (8, 18, 4)>, <17, (8, 18, 5)>, <17, (8, 18, 17)>, <18, (9, 19, 13)>, <18, (1, 19, 10)>, <18, (1, 19, 13)>, <18, (1, 19, 17)>, <18, (1, 10, 13)>, <19, (18, 10, 6)>.
