Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 14) (6, 18) (6, 29) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 19) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (26, 5) (24, 15) (24, 21) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 9) (1, 2) (1, 25) (15, 24) (15, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 9) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (5, 26) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 12) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 20) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 20) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 11) (23, 25) (23, 10) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 14) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 20) (11, 13) (11, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
8. Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\(4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 55\)

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
1. <6, 21, 14>
2. <6, 21, 9>
3. <6, 29, 14>
4. <7, 13, 27>
5. <12, 28, 20>
6. <13, 4, 7>
7. <14, 6, 29>
8. <16, 25, 0>
9. <19, 9, 14>
10. <20, 27, 12>
11. <20, 27, 2>
12. <20, 27, 3>
13. <20, 27, 11>
14. <21, 6, 24>
15. <25, 23, 10> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].
