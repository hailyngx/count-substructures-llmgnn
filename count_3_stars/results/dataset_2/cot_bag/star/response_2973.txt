Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (26, 17) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 6) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 28) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 27) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (23, 2) (23, 8) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 24) (15, 8) (15, 18) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 20) (25, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 25) (28, 17) (28, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (6, 27) (12, 3) (16, 26) (16, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 24) (22, 4) (22, 20) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 10) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 19) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 9, 26, 1, 21, 17, 7, 2, 29, 3, 8, 4, 15, 25, 11, 28, 5, 13, 6, 16, 0, 10, 22, 24, 18, 27, 19, and 20.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \(4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 81 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [81].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<9, 11, 24>, <9, 21, 11>, <9, 21, 26>, <9, 21, 7>, <26, 9, 11>, <26, 9, 24>, <26, 9, 21>, <26, 21, 1>, <26, 21, 6>, <26, 21, 16>, <1, 21, 9>, <1, 21, 6>, <1, 3, 27>, <21, 26, 16>, <21, 26, 7>, <21, 26, 1>, <21, 26, 9>, <21, 26, 4>, <17, 28, 2>, <7, 21, 11>, <7, 21, 27>, <2, 20, 25>, <2, 25, 1>, <2, 25, 20>, <2, 29, 13>, <29, 2, 13>, <3, 1, 21>, <3, 1, 25>, <8, 24, 9>, <8, 24, 4>, <8, 24, 15>, <23, 2, 28>, <4, 26, 24>, <4, 26, 17>, <15, 8, 24>, <15, 8, 18>, <20, 25, 1>, <20, 25, 2>, <20, 25, 27>, <11, 9, 21>, <11, 9, 25>, <11, 25, 1>, <28, 17, 13>, <5, 13, 17>, <5, 13, 29>, <13, 17, 26>, <13, 17, 28>, <6, 21, 7>, <6, 21, 16>, <6, 21, 27>, <12, 3, 27>, <16, 26, 21>, <16, 26, 6>, <27, 6, 21>, <0, 2, 25>, <0, 19, 10>, <0, 19, 27>, <10, 0, 19>, <10, 0, 24>, <10, 5, 13>, <10, 5, 18>, <10, 18, 15>, <22, 4, 26>, <22, 4, 24>, <24, 8, 15>, <18, 10, 15>, <27, 6, 21>, <27, 6, 19>, <27, 20, 25>, <19, 0, 10>, <19, 0, 27>, <19, 27, 20>
