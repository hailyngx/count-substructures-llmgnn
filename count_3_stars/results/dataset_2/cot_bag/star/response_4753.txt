Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 10) (13, 1) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 20) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 27) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 25) (12, 23) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 14) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 5) (29, 26) (29, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (1, 13) (1, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (20, 16) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 17) (5, 20) (16, 20) (16, 14) (14, 9) (14, 24) (14, 16) (14, 27) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 27) (0, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 17 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 21 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 23 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 26 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 29 forms 2 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes: \(1 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 70 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
