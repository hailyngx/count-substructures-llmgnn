Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (18, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 11) (0, 8) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (7, 1) (7, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 9) (8, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 17) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 10. So, it forms inom{3}{3}=1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 12, 14, 19. So, it forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars. These are <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (1, 12, 19)>, <3, (1, 14, 19)>, and <3, (12, 14, 19)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 10, 12, 15, 16, 9. So, it forms inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars. One such 3-star is <4, (10, 12, 15)>.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 11, 16, 17. So, it forms inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars. One such 3-star is <5, (2, 11, 17)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 13, 15, 18, 5. So, it forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars. These are <6, (13, 15, 18)> and <6, (13, 15, 5)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 13, 14, 9. So, it forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars. These are <9, (4, 13, 14)> and <9, (4, 13, 9)>.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 13, 5. So, it forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars. These are <11, (0, 2, 13)> and <11, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4. So, it forms inom{3}{3}=1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 9, 11. So, it forms inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars. One such 3-star is <13, (6, 7, 11)>.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 3, 9, 19. So, it forms inom{3}{3}=1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 10. So, it forms inom{3}{3}=1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, and Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which means they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [41]. 

So, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (1, 12, 14)>, <3, (1, 12, 19)>, <3, (1, 14, 19)>, <3, (12, 14, 19)>, <4, (10, 12, 15)>, <5, (2, 11, 17)>, <6, (13, 15, 18)>, <6, (13, 15, 5)>, <9, (4, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 13, 9)>, <11, (0, 2, 13)>, <11, (0, 2, 5)>.
