Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 17) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 19) (17, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 15) (16, 8) (16, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 10, 6, 2, 8, 4, 18, 1, 0, 7, 19, 16, 15, 3, and 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <5, (9, 6, 12)>  
    - <5, (9, 1, 12)>  
    - <5, (9, 1, 6)>  
    - <5, (6, 12, 1)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <9, (5, 8, 10)>  
    - <9, (5, 8, 4)>  
    - <9, (5, 8, 0)>  
    - <9, (5, 10, 4)>  
    - <9, (5, 10, 0)>  
    - <9, (8, 10, 4)>  
    - <9, (8, 10, 0)>  
    - <9, (10, 4, 0)>  
    - <9, (5, 4, 10)>  
    - <9, (8, 10, 0)>

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <10, (9, 11, 13)>  
    - <10, (9, 11, 2)>  
    - <10, (9, 13, 2)>  
    - <10, (11, 13, 2)>

- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <2, (10, 4, 3)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <8, (9, 16, 17)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <4, (9, 2, 18)>  
    - <4, (9, 2, 13)>  
    - <4, (9, 18, 13)>  
    - <4, (2, 18, 13)>

- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <18, (6, 4, 15)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <1, (5, 16, 19)>  
    - <1, (5, 14, 19)>  
    - <1, (5, 16, 14)>  
    - <1, (16, 19, 14)>

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <0, (9, 7, 12)>

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <19, (1, 15, 7)>

- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <15, (18, 19, 14)>  
    - <15, (18, 19, 12)>  
    - <15, (18, 14, 12)>  
    - <15, (19, 14, 12)>

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <14, (1, 13, 15)>

Counting all the 3-stars described above, we have a total of [29] unique 3-stars in this graph.
