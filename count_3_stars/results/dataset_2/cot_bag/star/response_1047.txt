Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 21) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 1) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 25) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 26) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 24) (26, 4) (26, 25) (26, 16) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 21) (19, 4) (19, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 21) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 29) (3, 2) (3, 28) (3, 23) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 20) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 20) (21, 11) (20, 28) (20, 21) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 9) (24, 14) (24, 25) (25, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (17, 18) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 3) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 21: 5 neighbors
- Node 22: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 5 neighbors

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes gives:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 53

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
