Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 5, 4, 9, 7, 6, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (9, 7, 6)>
    - <5, (9, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (9, 6, 1)>
    - <5, (7, 6, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (9, 7, 1)>
    - <4, (9, 8, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 6, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 6)>
    - <4, (9, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (8, 6, 2)>
    - <4, (9, 2, 3)>
    - <4, (2, 6, 0)>
    - <4, (3, 2, 0)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (4, 7, 3)>
    - <9, (4, 3, 2)>
    - <9, (7, 6, 5)>
    - <9, (3, 2, 0)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
    - <7, (6, 1, 4)>
    - <7, (9, 4, 3)>
    - <7, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (7, 4, 1)>
    - <6, (5, 8, 4)>
    - <6, (8, 4, 2)>
    - <6, (5, 1, 0)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 2)>
    - <6, (8, 2, 0)>
    - <6, (4, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (2, 0, 6)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <3, (9, 4, 1)>
    - <3, (4, 2, 0)>
    - <3, (9, 7, 5)>
    - <3, (4, 2, 6)>

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated gives a total of [36].
