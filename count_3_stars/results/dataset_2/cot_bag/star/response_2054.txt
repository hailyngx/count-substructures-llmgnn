Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
