Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 24) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 21) (0, 16) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (4, 27) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 17) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 11) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 10) (29, 3) (29, 15) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (27, 4) (27, 5) (27, 13) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 7) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 24) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 2) (14, 3) (23, 18) (23, 4) (8, 25) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 19) (21, 22) (21, 26) (5, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 5) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 6) (25, 8) (13, 29) (13, 27) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 86 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].

Some of the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 10, 24)>, <4, (2, 7, 24)>, <5, (10, 17, 27)>, <7, (2, 6, 24)>, <10, (5, 7, 28)>, <11, (22, 7, 26)>, <15, (3, 20, 29)>, <16, (0, 4, 24)>, <17, (1, 5, 19)>, <18, (22, 26, 23)>, <19, (17, 6, 28)>, <20, (15, 26, 29)>, <22, (11, 21, 26)>, <24, (3, 16, 7)>, <26, (18, 21, 22)>, <27, (4, 13, 5)>, <28, (10, 29, 19)>, <29, (15, 13, 28)>.
