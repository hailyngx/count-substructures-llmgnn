Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (6, 10, 11)
- Node 1: (3, 12, 14)
- Node 2: (4, 5, 10, 13)
- Node 3: (1, 7, 12)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 7, 11)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 5, 9)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 10, 14)
- Node 8: (9, 12, 13)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13)
- Node 10: (0, 2, 7, 9, 12, 13)
- Node 11: (0, 4, 9, 11, 12, 14)
- Node 12: (1, 3, 8, 10, 11)
- Node 13: (2, 8, 9, 10)
- Node 14: (1, 7, 11)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- From node 0: [0]
- From node 1: [0]
- From node 2: [1]
- From node 3: [0]
- From node 4: [1]
- From node 5: [0]
- From node 6: [0]
- From node 7: [2]
- From node 8: [1]
- From node 9: [4]
- From node 10: [2]
- From node 11: [3]
- From node 12: [2]
- From node 13: [1]
- From node 14: [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <7, (4, 10, 14)>
- <7, (4, 7, 10)>
- <11, (0, 9, 11)>
- <11, (9, 11, 12)>
- <11, (9, 11, 14)>
- <13, (8, 9, 13)>
- <13, (10, 13, 9)>
- <13, (10, 13, 2)>
- <13, (10, 13, 9)>
- <14, (1, 7, 11)>
- <14, (7, 11, 14)>
- <14, (11, 12, 14)>
