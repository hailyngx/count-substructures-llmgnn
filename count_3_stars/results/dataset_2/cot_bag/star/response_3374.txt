Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 2}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {4, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 forms 15 3-stars
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 15 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 3 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 57.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (9, 4, 5)>
<0, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (9, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
