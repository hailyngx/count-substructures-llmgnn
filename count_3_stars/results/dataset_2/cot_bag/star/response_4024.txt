Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
Since the graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can create the following adjacency list representation of the graph:

1: [3, 6, 10, 12]
3: [1, 5]
10: [1, 11, 6, 8, 7, 9]
11: [10, 13]
8: [10, 4, 2, 14]
13: [11, 4, 9]
4: [8, 13, 9, 5]
2: [8, 12, 5, 6, 7, 0]
0: [2, 7, 5]
7: [10, 2, 0, 6, 5]
6: [1, 10, 2, 7]
12: [1, 2, 14, 9]
5: [3, 4, 2, 0, 7]
14: [8, 12, 9]
9: [10, 13, 4, 12, 14]

Now we will find the 3-stars in this graph. Firstly, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 12
Node 10 has 6 neighbors: 1, 11, 6, 8, 7, 9
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 10, 4, 2, 14
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 11, 4, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 8, 13, 9, 5
Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 8, 12, 5, 6, 7, 0
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 5
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 10, 2, 0, 6, 5
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 10, 2, 7
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 14, 9
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 2, 0, 7
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 9
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 10, 13, 4, 12, 14

Now, we count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 10: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 13: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 2: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 12: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 5: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 87

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [87].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<8, (4, 13, 9)>
<8, (4, 13, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 2)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 0)>
