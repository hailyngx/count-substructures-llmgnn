Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{7}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 \]

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 99 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 99.

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (2, 8, 14)>
<1, (11, 13, 14)>
<4, (2, 8, 6)>
<5, (7, 12, 4)>
<6, (3, 8, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<10, (7, 14, 0)>
<11, (0, 1, 13)>
<12, (5, 1, 7)>
<13, (2, 11, 12)>
<14, (1, 9, 10)> 

So the final answer is [99].
