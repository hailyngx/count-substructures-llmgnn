Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 1, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {9, 3, 0, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 13, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 13, 14, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 3, 14, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {5, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 4, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 6, 0, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 6, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 13}

We observe that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 have three or more neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node gives us a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 76 \).

So, there are 76 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us \( [76] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 1, 12)>, <0, (5, 3, 12)>, <0, (5, 12, 10)>, <0, (7, 1, 12)>, <0, (7, 3, 12)>, <0, (7, 12, 10)>, <1, (9, 3, 0)>, <1, (9, 0, 12)>, <1, (3, 0, 12)>, <2, (5, 11, 13)>, <2, (5, 13, 12)>, <2, (11, 13, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 13)>, <4, (7, 13, 14)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (9, 2, 10)>, <8, (4, 11, 13)>, <8, (4, 13, 14)>, <8, (11, 13, 14)>, <9, (5, 2, 10)>, <11, (9, 4, 8)>, <11, (9, 8, 2)>, <11, (4, 8, 13)>, <11, (4, 13, 14)>, <11, (8, 13, 14)>, <12, (1, 6, 0)>, <12, (1, 6, 2)>, <12, (1, 0, 10)>, <12, (6, 13, 2)>, <12, (0, 2, 10)>, <13, (4, 6, 11)>, <13, (4, 2, 14)>, <13, (6, 11, 2)>, <13, (11, 2, 14)>
