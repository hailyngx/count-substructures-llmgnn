Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 86 \]

Hence, there are 86 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 6, 13)>
<0, (5, 6, 13)>

<3, (7, 10, 13)>
<3, (11, 13, 1)>
<3, (11, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 11, 13)>
<6, (12, 1, 11)>
<6, (12, 0, 1)>
<6, (12, 0, 13)>
<7, (10, 13, 14)>
<7, (2, 13, 10)>
<7, (2, 13, 14)>
<13, (11, 1, 9)>
<13, (11, 1, 6)>
<13, (11, 2, 6)>

<13, (0, 12, 6)>
<13, (0, 12, 5)>
<13, (0, 12, 4)>
<13, (0, 6, 4)>
<13, (0, 6, 5)>
<13, (0, 6, 5)>
<13, (4, 5, 0)>
<13, (4, 5, 6)>
<13, (4, 5, 0)>

<13, (5, 6, 4)>
<13, (5, 6, 12)>
<13, (5, 12, 0)>
<13, (6, 12, 0)>
<13, (6, 12, 1)>
<13, (6, 12, 0)>
<13, (12, 0, 4)>
<13, (12, 0, 5)>
<13, (12, 0, 6)>
<13, (12, 6, 5)>
<13, (12, 6, 1)>
<14, (13, 2, 7)>
<14, (13, 2, 10)>
<14, (13, 2, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 86.
