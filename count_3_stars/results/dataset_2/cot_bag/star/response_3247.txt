Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 

Response:
The node degrees in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 6

We'll focus on the nodes with degrees 3 or more to identify the 3-stars:
- For nodes 6 and 9, we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \), which can be written as [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 2)>
