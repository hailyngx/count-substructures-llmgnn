Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes in the graph. Let's build the graph with its nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
Edges: (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 15), (9, 19), (10, 8), (10, 4), (10, 13), (11, 15), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 1), (18, 19), (19, 9), (19, 18), (19, 17), (2, 12), (2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 16), (2, 14), (12, 2), (12, 0), (0, 12), (0, 3), (0, 13), (3, 0), (3, 14), (3, 6), (3, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2), (14, 2), (14, 3), (14, 16), (14, 13), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 15), (7, 6), (7, 13), (7, 17), (15, 9), (15, 11), (15, 6), (17, 19), (17, 7), (17, 4), (13, 10), (13, 2), (13, 0), (13, 14), (13, 7), (16, 2), (16, 14), (16, 4), (4, 10), (4, 3), (4, 17), (4, 16)
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
   - <2, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (1, 13, 16)>, <2, (1, 14, 16)>, <2, (13, 14, 16)>, <2, (1, 3, 14)>, <2, (1, 3, 16)>, <2, (1, 14, 16)>, <2, (3, 14, 16)>, <2, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (13, 14, 16)>
  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 17)>
  
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <4, (10, 16, 17)>, <4, (3, 16, 17)>, <4, (3, 13, 17)>, <4, (10, 13, 16)>
  
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with them:
   - <8, (1, 9, 10)>
  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
   - <9, (5, 8, 19)>, <9, (5, 15, 19)>, <9, (8, 15, 19)>, <9, (5, 8, 15)>, <9, (5, 8, 10)>, <9, (5, 10, 15)>, <9, (8, 10, 15)>, <9, (8, 10, 19)>, <9, (8, 15, 19)>, <9, (10, 15, 19)>
  
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
   - <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <13, (0, 7, 17)>, <13, (0, 10, 14)>, <13, (0, 10, 16)>, <13, (0, 14, 16)>, <13, (7, 14, 17)>, <13, (7, 10, 14)>, <13, (7, 10, 16)>, <13, (7, 14, 16)>, <13, (10, 14, 16)>
  
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <15, (6, 9, 11)>, <15, (6, 9, 15)>, <15, (6, 11, 15)>, <15, (9, 11, 15)>
  
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <17, (4, 7, 19)>, <17, (4, 7, 17)>, <17, (4, 13, 19)>, <17, (7, 13, 19)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars yields a total of 43.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [ 43 ].
