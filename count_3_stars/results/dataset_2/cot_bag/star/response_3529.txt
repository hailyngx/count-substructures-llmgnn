Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 11, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 1, 8, 14, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {11, 0, 10, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 3, 4, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 14, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 12: {1, 8, 5, 2, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 4, 2, 7}

The nodes with three or more neighbors that can potentially form a 3-star are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Now summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].
