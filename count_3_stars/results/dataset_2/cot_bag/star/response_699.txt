Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 5, 4, 6, 2  
2: 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 0  
3: 2, 8  
4: 9, 7, 1, 6  
5: 9, 2, 1  
6: 9, 4, 7, 1, 8  
7: 9, 4, 6  
8: 9, 6, 3, 2, 0  
9: 5, 9, 8, 4, 7, 6, 2  


Let's now count the 3-stars in this graph:

From node 2, we can form 4 3-stars: 
<2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 1, 4)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 4)>.

From node 6, we can form 6 3-stars:
<6, (9, 4, 7)>, <6, (9, 4, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 5)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 1, 7)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>.

From node 8, we can form 4 3-stars: 
<8, (9, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 3, 2)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars: [14].
