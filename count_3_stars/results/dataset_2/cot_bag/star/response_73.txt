Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 10) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (3, 28) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 22) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 29) (15, 0) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (8, 20) (8, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 12) (26, 25) (26, 22) (6, 28) (6, 24) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 27) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 23) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 27) (9, 27) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (10, 4) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 18) (23, 3) (23, 2) (23, 13) (27, 8) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:

Node 1: (1, 21), (1, 17), (1, 19)
Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 24), (4, 10)
Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 4), (7, 15), (7, 5)
Node 15: (15, 21), (15, 7), (15, 29), (15, 0)
Node 19: (19, 1), (19, 21), (19, 29), (19, 18)
Node 20: (20, 0), (20, 8), (20, 28)
Node 22: (22, 25), (22, 26), (22, 28), (22, 12)
Node 25: (25, 26), (25, 22), (25, 14)
Node 27: (27, 8), (27, 5), (27, 17), (27, 9)
Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 20), (28, 22), (28, 6), (28, 18)
Node 29: (29, 2), (29, 19), (29, 15)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 35\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (17, 19, 21)>
<4, (7, 10, 24)>
<7, (4, 15, 21)>
<15, (0, 21, 29)>
<19, (1, 21, 29)>
<20, (0, 8, 28)>
<22, (12, 25, 26)>
<25, (14, 22, 26)>
<27, (5, 17, 8)>
<28, (3, 18, 22)>
<29, (2, 15, 19)>
