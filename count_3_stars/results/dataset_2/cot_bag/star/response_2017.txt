Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 16) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 15) (14, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 24) (25, 3) (25, 23) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 29) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 6) (4, 23) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 24) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 15) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 29) (2, 4) (2, 22) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 0) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 24) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 11) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 0) (20, 1) (6, 14) (6, 26) (6, 4) (0, 12) (0, 28) (0, 24) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 4) (29, 13) (29, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
6. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
10. Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
11. Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
12. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
13. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 16, 20>
<3, 11, 25>
<9, 17, 28>
<9, 21, 15>
<10, 7, 29>
<15, 11, 21>
<16, 1, 24>
<18, 5, 22>
<18, 5, 19>
<18, 8, 24>
<19, 5, 28>
<24, 0, 28>
<24, 3, 8>
<24, 16, 1>
<25, 3, 23>
<26, 6, 4>
<26, 6, 14>
<26, 1, 10>
<26, 15, 21>
<28, 0, 12>
