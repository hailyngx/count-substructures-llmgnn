Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list those nodes:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 9, 8, 2, 3, 1
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 3, 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 3, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 0, 1
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 7, 9, 0, 3

From the list above, we see that nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 2 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23]. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9, 8)>
<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<0, (9, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (4, 2, 8)>
