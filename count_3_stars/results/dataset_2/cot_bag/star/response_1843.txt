Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 3) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (21, 13) (21, 2) (8, 23) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 27) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 20) (18, 25) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 3) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 29) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 27) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 28) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 11) (5, 13) (5, 15) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 10) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 28) (10, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (6, 26) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 27) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 14) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 16) (24, 14) (27, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (28, 23) (28, 1) (28, 10) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 18) (14, 19) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 13, 22, 4, 7, 21, 23, 0, 2, 15, 9, 1, 17, 5, 19, 29, 10, 12, 3, 11, 16, 24, 27, 28, and 25. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \).

So, the final answer is [47].    

The unique 3-stars are: <13, (22, 21, 3)>, <22, (9, 19, 25)>, <15, (2, 12, 29)>, <29, (9, 10, 24)>.
