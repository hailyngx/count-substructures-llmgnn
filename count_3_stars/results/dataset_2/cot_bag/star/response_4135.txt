Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 5) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 23) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 10) (0, 20) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 23) (20, 11) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (26, 4) (26, 20) (26, 14) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 27) (17, 18) (17, 6) (27, 18) (27, 9) (27, 19) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 2) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (12, 22) (12, 10) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 23) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 20) (23, 24) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 12) (11, 20) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 18, 19, 10, 25)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 8, 26, 29)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 8, 17, 19)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 5, 15)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 4, 6, 14)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 22, 27)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 2, 12, 28, 29)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 8, 15, 19, 26)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 7, 14, 23)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 0, 2, 17, 24, 27)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 14, 27)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 0, 11, 23, 26)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 9, 12, 13, 25, 28)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 15, 20, 24, 28)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 16, 18, 23)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 4, 14, 20, 26)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 9, 18, 19)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 10, 13, 22, 23, 29)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 4, 10, 28)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node gives us a total of 78 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [78].

Here is a list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (4, 18, 25)>
- <2, (4, 19, 26)>
- <2, (4, 10, 28)>
- <4, (8, 14, 26)>
- <6, (8, 17, 19)>
- <10, (12, 28, 29)>
- <18, (2, 24, 27)>
- <19, (5, 6, 14)>
- <22, (12, 13, 28)>
- <28, (13, 22, 29)>
