Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Applying the given information to construct the graph, we have:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 4), (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7), (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 0), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 0)}

Now, we need to count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 9), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 7). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 7)>, <0, (9, 2, 7)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8). Only 1 3-star can be formed with node 1 as the center: <1, (5, 4, 8)>.

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 4). So, there are 5 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 4)>.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (5, 0, 6)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 0). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 0)>.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3). Only 1 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 1, 3)>.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (5, 3, 7)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (3, 7, 2)>.

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 0). Only 1 3-star can be formed with node 7 as the center: <7, (6, 8, 0)>.

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 7). So, there are 5 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 2)>.

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0). So, there are 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (4, 2, 0)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
