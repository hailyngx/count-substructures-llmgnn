Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described:

```
    1 -- 2
   /|\  /|\
  9 7- 6-0-3
   \| |/ \|/
    4--5--8
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <0, (5, 3, 2)>
- <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <0, (3, 1, 2)>

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- <1, (9, 6, 7)>
- <1, (9, 7, 8)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 5)>
- <1, (9, 4, 8)>
- <1, (9, 8, 6)>
- <1, (9, 6, 2)>
- <1, (7, 4, 3)>
- <1, (7, 4, 5)>
- <1, (7, 5, 6)>
- <1, (7, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- <1, (5, 8, 7)>
- <1, (6, 8, 2)>
- <1, (6, 2, 0)>
- <1, (8, 2, 0)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <2, (6, 1, 9)>
- <2, (6, 1, 7)>
- <2, (6, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <3, (5, 4, 0)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 1, 0)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (9, 1, 7)>

Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- <5, (3, 0, 1)>
- <5, (3, 0, 2)>
- <5, (3, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 1)>
- <5, (4, 1, 6)>
- <5, (7, 1, 6)>
- <5, (7, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 2)>
- <5, (1, 2, 0)>
- <5, (6, 2, 0)>
- <5, (9, 1, 6)>
- <5, (9, 1, 7)>
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <5, (9, 7, 8)>
- <5, (9, 7, 1)>
- <5, (9, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 4)>
- <6, (2, 0, 8)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <7, (9, 4, 1)>
- <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- <7, (9, 1, 8)>
- <7, (4, 3, 1)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <9, (4, 1, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 1)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [72].
