Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 9) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 17) (26, 19) (26, 23) (21, 28) (21, 3) (28, 21) (28, 16) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 16) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (11, 19) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 6) (8, 9) (8, 25) (18, 19) (18, 9) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 23) (0, 4) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 3) (23, 25) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 27) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 25) (14, 12) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 17) (13, 29) (13, 10) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes in this graph, including: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

Let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Next, for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star
- Node 19 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 22 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 23 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 25 forms 6 3-stars
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [57].
