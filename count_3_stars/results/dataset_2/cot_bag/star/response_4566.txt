Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 and 5 have 4 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and 3 have 3 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding those up, we have \( 5 \times 10 + 2 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 50 + 8 + 2 = 60 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
