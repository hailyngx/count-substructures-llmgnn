Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars. 
Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula  \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors, and then count them.
Considering the nodes listed, we have:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 80 \]
Therefore, there are 80 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this number inside brackets gives us the final answer: [80]
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (2, 5, 14)>, <2, (1, 5, 13)>, <3, (2, 9, 13)>, <4, (1, 8, 10)>, <6, (2, 10, 14)>, <8, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (0, 3, 12)>, <10, (0, 4, 6)>, <12, (3, 6, 9)>, <13, (2, 11, 14)>, <14, (1, 6, 12)>
