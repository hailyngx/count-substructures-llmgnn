Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 1) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 15) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (17, 19) (17, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Let's calculate how many 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [35].
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (11, 4, 15)>, <9, (10, 2, 19)>, <10, (11, 15, 18)>, <12, (1, 4, 0)>, <14, (18, 15, 6)>, <16, (1, 18, 0)>, and <18, (16, 10, 2)>.
