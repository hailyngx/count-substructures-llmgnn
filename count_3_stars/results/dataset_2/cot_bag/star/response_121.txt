Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (8, 0, 11), (0, 13, 7), (0, 12, 10). This node forms 3 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 2), (1, 14, 10). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 8, 9), (4, 13, 5), (4, 5, 9). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 1, 9), (5, 4, 13), (5, 11, 14). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 8, 7), (6, 1, 2), (6, 11, 3). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 4, 0), (8, 13, 6), (8, 9, 0). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: (9, 4, 1), (9, 8, 7), (9, 3, 12). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (12, 0, 10), (12, 5, 2), (12, 9, 2). This node forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: (13, 4, 8), (13, 0, 7), (13, 5, 14). This node forms 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3 * 9 = 27.

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we get [27].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 8, 4, 13>, <1, 5, 9, 4>, <2, 1, 6, 14>, <3, 9, 6, 12>, <7, 0, 13, 6>, <10, 0, 12, 2>, <11, 5, 14, 1>.
