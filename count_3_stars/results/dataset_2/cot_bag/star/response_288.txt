Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the above nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 2 3-stars
- Node 3: 2 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 2 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2] = [14]

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (9, 0, 1)>  
<1, (0, 1, 2)>  
<2, (1, 2, 3)>  
<2, (3, 2, 6)>  
<3, (2, 3, 5)>  
<3, (5, 3, 9)>  
<5, (3, 5, 8)>  
<6, (9, 6, 3)>  
<7, (9, 7, 2)>  
<8, (5, 8, 7)>  
<9, (0, 9, 6)>  
<9, (6, 9, 7)>
