Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 6) (4, 5) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 5) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, and 17. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1, we have 3 neighbors (6, 2, 11). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 2, we have 4 neighbors (1, 13, 11). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 3, we have 3 neighbors (16, 13, 19). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 6, we have 4 neighbors (9, 1, 10). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, we have 4 neighbors (18, 16, 19). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 12, we have 4 neighbors (0, 13, 17). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 13, we have 4 neighbors (2, 3, 17). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 16, we have 4 neighbors (3, 0, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 17, we have 5 neighbors (15, 13, 16, 12). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 \) 3-stars inside brackets [].
