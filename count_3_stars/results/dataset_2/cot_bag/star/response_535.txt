Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1: 9, 4, 2
2: 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 0
3: 9, 7, 6, 8
4: 5, 8, 0, 1
5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 4
6: 5, 9, 3, 2
7: 3, 2
8: 5, 4, 0, 3
9: 5, 2, 3, 1, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 56 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
