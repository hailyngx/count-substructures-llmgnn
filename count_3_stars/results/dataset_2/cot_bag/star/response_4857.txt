Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors, and we will compute the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 9, 10)>
2. Node 2: <2, (5, 8, 11)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 13)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 13)>
5. Node 5: <5, (2, 12, 13)>
6. Node 6: <6, (7, 8, 12)>
7. Node 7: <7, (3, 10, 13)>
8. Node 8: <8, (2, 6, 9)>
9. Node 10: <10, (0, 9, 14)>
10. Node 11: <11, (2, 4, 13)>
11. Node 12: <12, (5, 6, 1)>
12. Node 13: <13, (3, 5, 4)>
13. Node 14: <14, (0, 10, 7)>

Since each of these 3-stars is unique, we count each only once. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
