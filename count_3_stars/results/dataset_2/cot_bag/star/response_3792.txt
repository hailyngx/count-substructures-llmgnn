Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 5) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14.

For the node 0, there are 5 choices of 3-stars:
- <0, (10, 11, 12)>
- <0, (10, 4, 12)>
- <0, (10, 14, 5)>
- <0, (11, 4, 12)>
- <0, (11, 14, 5)>

For the node 3, there are 5 choices of 3-stars:
- <3, (1, 11, 4)>
- <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 2)>
- <3, (11, 10, 8)>
- <3, (11, 8, 4)>

For the node 4, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <4, (3, 8, 13)>

For the node 5, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <5, (10, 2, 14)>

For the node 6, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <6, (7, 2, 14)>

For the node 9, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <9, (10, 11, 14)>

For the node 10, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <10, (11, 0, 10)>

For the node 11, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <11, (3, 10, 0)>

For the node 14, there is 1 choice of 3-star:
- <14, (7, 0, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 17.
