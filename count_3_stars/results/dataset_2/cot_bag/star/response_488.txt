Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (7, 18) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's go through each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:

Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 17), (1, 14), (1, 10), (1, 12) - Total of inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<1, (6, 17, 14)>, <1, (6, 17, 10)>, <1, (6, 17, 12)>, <1, (6, 14, 10)>, <1, (6, 14, 12)>, <1, (6, 10, 12)>, <1, (17, 14, 10)>, <1, (17, 14, 12)>, <1, (17, 10, 12)>, <1, (14, 10, 12)>

Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 17), (6, 19) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<6, (5, 1, 17)>, <6, (5, 1, 19)>, <6, (5, 17, 19)>, <6, (1, 17, 19)>

Node 9: (9, 12), (9, 2), (9, 15) - Total of inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<9, (12, 2, 15)>

Node 11: (11, 8), (11, 0), (11, 13), (11, 18) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<11, (8, 0, 13)>, <11, (8, 0, 18)>, <11, (8, 13, 18)>, <11, (0, 13, 18)>

Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 17), (12, 16), (12, 9) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<12, (1, 17, 16)>, <12, (1, 17, 9)>, <12, (1, 16, 9)>, <12, (17, 16, 9)>

Node 13: (13, 3), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 19) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<13, (3, 11, 10)>, <13, (3, 11, 19)>, <13, (3, 10, 19)>, <13, (11, 10, 19)>

Node 14: (14, 1), (14, 16), (14, 3), (14, 15) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<14, (1, 16, 3)>, <14, (1, 16, 15)>, <14, (1, 3, 15)>, <14, (16, 3, 15)>

Node 17: (17, 6), (17, 1), (17, 12), (17, 18) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<17, (6, 1, 12)>, <17, (6, 1, 18)>, <17, (6, 12, 18)>, <17, (1, 12, 18)>

Node 18: (18, 17), (18, 15), (18, 11), (18, 7) - Total of inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<18, (17, 15, 11)>, <18, (17, 15, 7)>, <18, (17, 11, 7)>, <18, (15, 11, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35, which can be written as [35].
