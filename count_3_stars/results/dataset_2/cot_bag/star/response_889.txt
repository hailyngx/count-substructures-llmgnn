Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [1] <4, (6, 9, 7)>
- Node 5: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [1] <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 7: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [] (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [1] <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Putting these together, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
