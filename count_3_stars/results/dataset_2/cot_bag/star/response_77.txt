Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 20) (17, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 27) (24, 22) (24, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (26, 22) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 4) (28, 14) (28, 2) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (19, 0) (19, 23) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 20) (11, 8) (14, 24) (14, 28) (14, 12) (14, 25) (25, 1) (25, 14) (25, 4) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 19) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 22) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 29) (12, 14) (12, 9) (27, 1) (27, 5) (27, 21) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, and 29.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \), 
where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
5. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
6. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
8. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
9. Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
10. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
11. Node 20 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
12. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
13. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
14. Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
15. Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
16. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
17. Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes results in a total of 40 3-stars.  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
