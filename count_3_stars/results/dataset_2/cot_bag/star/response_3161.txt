Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify these nodes and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 29, 11, 25
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (29, 11, 25)>

Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 2, 20, 3
Number of 3-stars with node 29 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<29, (2, 20, 3)>

Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 17, 7, 12, 24, 5
Number of 3-stars with node 14 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<14, (17, 7, 12)>, <14, (17, 7, 24)>, <14, (17, 7, 5)>, <14, (17, 12, 24)>, <14, (17, 12, 5)>, <14, (17, 24, 5)>, <14, (7, 12, 24)>, <14, (7, 12, 5)>, <14, (7, 24, 5)>, <14, (12, 24, 5)>

Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 14, 0, 12
Number of 3-stars with node 17 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<17, (14, 0, 12)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 19, 0, 24
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (19, 0, 24)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 28, 16, 6
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<8, (28, 16, 6)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 14, 28, 25, 20
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (14, 28, 25)>, <5, (14, 28, 20)>, <5, (14, 25, 20)>, <5, (28, 25, 20)>

Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 14, 17, 6, 15
Number of 3-stars with node 12 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<12, (14, 17, 6)>, <12, (14, 17, 15)>, <12, (14, 6, 15)>, <12, (17, 6, 15)>

Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 1
Number of 3-stars with node 11 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<11, (2, 4, 1)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 25, 15, 24, 27
Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (25, 15, 24)>, <9, (25, 15, 27)>, <9, (25, 24, 27)>, <9, (15, 24, 27)>

Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 1, 21, 26, 19
Number of 3-stars with node 10 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<10, (1, 21, 26)>, <10, (1, 21, 19)>, <10, (1, 26, 19)>, <10, (21, 26, 19)>

Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 29, 22, 5, 6
Number of 3-stars with node 20 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<20, (29, 22, 5)>, <20, (29, 22, 6)>, <20, (29, 5, 6)>, <20, (22, 5, 6)>

Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 7, 15, 25, 26
Number of 3-stars with node 23 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<23, (7, 15, 25)>, <23, (7, 15, 26)>, <23, (7, 25, 26)>, <23, (15, 25, 26)>

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 17, 4, 3
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (17, 4, 3)>

Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 29, 0
No 3-star can be formed with node 3 as the center since it does not have at least 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30.
