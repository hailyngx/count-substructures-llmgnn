Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

The graph has 30 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}.

The edges can be represented as a list:
(3, 15), (3, 14), (3, 9), (3, 4), (15, 3), (15, 2), (6, 9), (6, 12), (6, 13), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 28), (2, 15), (2, 29), (2, 26), (2, 13), (29, 2), (29, 16), (28, 9), (28, 18), (7, 12), (7, 5), (7, 1), (12, 6), (12, 7), (12, 21), (12, 14), (12, 22), (26, 2), (26, 25), (26, 11), (1, 7), (1, 25), (1, 14), (1, 24), (16, 29), (16, 10), (8, 9), (8, 18), (10, 16), (10, 21), (10, 22), (10, 25), (21, 12), (21, 10), (21, 4), (21, 5), (25, 26), (25, 1), (25, 10), (25, 27), (27, 25), (27, 11), (27, 5), (14, 3), (14, 12), (14, 1), (0, 11), (0, 23), (13, 6), (13, 2), (11, 26), (11, 27), (11, 0), (19, 17), (19, 20), (24, 1), (24, 23), (4, 3), (4, 9), (4, 21), (20, 19), (20, 23), (22, 12), (22, 10), (22, 17), (17, 19), (17, 22), (17, 18), (23, 0), (23, 24), (23, 20), (18, 28), (18, 8), (18, 17), (5, 7), (5, 21), (5, 27).

Next, let's identify the nodes that are the centers of 3-star graphs. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 55

Therefore, there are 55 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [55].
