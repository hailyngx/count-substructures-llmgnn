Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 12) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 13) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 18) (28, 6) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 26) (29, 18) (29, 23) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 27) (8, 21) (8, 12) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 2) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 4) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 26) (5, 27) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 9) (24, 21) (24, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 14) (1, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 24) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 -- 15 -- 19
|     |     |
24    9     13
|     |  /  |
|     14 -- 16
|        |  /
|        17
|        |
12 -- 4 -- 11 -- 23
|        |  \  |
|        21    29
|        |     |
0 -- 8 -- 10    5
|     |  /  \
|     21    27
|     |     |
24    16 -- 26
|     |  /  |
|     14    13 -- 25
|     |  \  |     |
9 -- 15 -- 20    7
      |     |     |
      19    25 -- 3
            |     |
            27 -- 1
```

From the provided information, we can see that the following nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 15: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 21: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 22: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 26: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 13: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are 36 3-stars in the graph. Listing them uniquely:
