Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors = inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1 has 4 neighbors = inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 has 5 neighbors = inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 4 neighbors = inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors = inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5 has 2 neighbors = no 3-star formed
Node 6 has 4 neighbors = inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7 has 5 neighbors = inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 8 has 6 neighbors = inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors = inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70]. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
