Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 3), (9, 0), (4, 13), (4, 6), (7, 6), (7, 1), (3, 7), (11, 8), (11, 12), (8, 6), (8, 14), (8, 10), (0, 13), (10, 0), (2, 7), (2, 13), (6, 12), (14, 1)

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 5 has 5 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 11 has 6 neighbors
Node 8 has 4 neighbors
Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 12 has 4 neighbors
Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 56

Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (2, 11, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (11, 3, 4)>
<11, (0, 12, 8)>
<11, (3, 4, 12)>
<11, (8, 6, 12)>
<0, (10, 13, 8)>
<0, (13, 2, 6)>
<6, (7, 12, 14)>
