Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The graph with the provided nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- 1: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- 3: {0, 6}
- 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
- 5: {2, 6, 8}
- 6: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- 8: {2, 5, 9}
- 9: {0, 1, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (1, 4, 6)> <2, (1, 5, 8)> <2, (1, 4, 8)> <2, (4, 5, 6)> <2, (4, 8, 6)> <2, (1, 5, 6)> <2, (1, 4, 9)> <2, (7, 8, 9)> <2, (7, 1, 9)> <2, (7, 4, 9)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (0, 1, 6)> <4, (0, 2, 6)> <4, (0, 7, 9)> <4, (1, 2, 6)> <4, (1, 7, 9)> <4, (7, 0, 9)> <4, (2, 5, 6)> <4, (5, 2, 6)> <4, (5, 6, 8)> <4, (2, 8, 6)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (2, 3, 4)> <6, (2, 4, 5)> <6, (4, 5, 8)> <6, (3, 4, 6)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (1, 4, 7)> <9, (1, 7, 8)> <9, (2, 5, 8)> <9, (2, 8, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
