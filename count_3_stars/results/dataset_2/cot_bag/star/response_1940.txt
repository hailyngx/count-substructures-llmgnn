Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 3, 10, 11, 12, 13
- So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0. 

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 8, 9, 11, 13
- So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 1.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 9, 11, 13
- So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 2.

For node 3: 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8, 10
- So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3.

For node 4: 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 14
- So, there is only 1 3-star with node 4.

For node 6: 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 9, 10, 11
- So, there is only 1 3-star with node 6.

For node 7: 
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 13, 14
- So, there is only 1 3-star with node 7.

For node 9: 
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 2
- So, there is only 1 3-star with node 9.

For node 14: 
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 12
- So, there is only 1 3-star with node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (2, 8, 13)>, <2, (1, 9, 13)>, <3, (0, 4, 10)>, <4, (3, 6, 14)>, <6, (4, 10, 11)>, <7, (5, 9, 13)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <14, (4, 8, 12)>.
