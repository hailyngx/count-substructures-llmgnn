Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
There are a total of $20$ nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node $0$ is connected to nodes $5$ and $9$.
- Node $1$ is connected to nodes $2$, $11$, $13$, $17$, and $18$.
- Node $2$ is connected to nodes $1$, $10$, and $17$.
- Node $3$ is connected to nodes $7$ and $13$.
- Node $4$ is connected to nodes $8$, $11$, and $12$.
- Node $5$ is connected to nodes $0$, $17$, and $18$.
- Node $6$ is connected to nodes $7$, $10$, $16$.
- Node $7$ is connected to nodes $3$, $6$.
- Node $8$ is connected to nodes $4$, $11$, $12$, and $17$.
- Node $9$ is connected to nodes $0$, $19$.
- Node $10$ is connected to nodes $2$, $6$, and $17$.
- Node $11$ is connected to nodes $1$, $4$, $8$, $19$.
- Node $12$ is connected to nodes $4$, $8$, $15$.
- Node $13$ is connected to nodes $1$, $3$, $15$, $19$.
- Node $14$ is connected to nodes $15$, $19$.
- Node $15$ is connected to nodes $12$, $13$, and $14$.
- Node $16$ is connected to nodes $6$, $18$.
- Node $17$ is connected to nodes $1$, $2$, $5$, $8$, and $10$.
- Node $18$ is connected to nodes $5$, $16$, and $1$.
- Node $19$ is connected to nodes $9$, $11$, $13$, and $14$.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms $C(4,3) = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms $C(4,3) = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms $C(4,3) = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms $C(5,3) = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms $C(4,3) = 4$ 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of $1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24$ 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is $[24]$.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 13, 15>
- <5, 0, 9>
- <8, 4, 11>
- <8, 4, 12>
- <8, 11, 19>
- <8, 17, 1>
- <11, 1, 13>
- <11, 4, 12>
- <11, 8, 19>
- <13, 1, 15>
- <13, 1, 19>
- <13, 3, 7>
- <13, 3, 19>
- <15, 12, 4>
- <15, 12, 13>
- <17, 1, 18>
- <17, 1, 2>
- <17, 5, 0>
- <17, 8, 4>
- <17, 8, 11>
- <18, 1, 17>
- <19, 11, 13>
- <19, 11, 4>
- <19, 13, 1>
