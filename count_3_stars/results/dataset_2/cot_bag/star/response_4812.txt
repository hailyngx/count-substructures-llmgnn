Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 9, 4, 6
- Node 1: 6, 4, 8
- Node 2: 9, 8, 3
- Node 3: 6, 8, 7, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8, 6
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 8, 7, 0, 6, 5

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- For Node 0, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 3, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 4, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 6, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- For Node 8, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For Node 9, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20] = 62

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 2)>
