Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as follows:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 60.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
[<4, (7, 13, 14)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>, <14, (4, 13, 3)>, <11, (4, 5, 13)>]
