Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 27) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 27) (21, 5) (21, 25) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 4) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 15) (20, 25) (15, 11) (15, 25) (15, 27) (15, 17) (27, 16) (27, 1) (27, 15) (27, 24) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 13) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 8) (4, 19) (6, 24) (6, 12) (28, 9) (28, 7) (28, 12) (0, 14) (0, 22) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 24) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 19) (13, 23) (13, 17) (7, 25) (7, 28) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 22) (17, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 17) (22, 0) (22, 19) (22, 17) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 10) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1:
There are 3 neighbors connected to node 1: 2, 5, and 27. So there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1 as the center.

Node 2:
There are also 3 neighbors connected to node 2: 1, 29, and 14. So there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 2 as the center.

Node 4:
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 4: 11, 29, 8, and 19. So there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. 

Node 5:
There are also 4 neighbors connected to node 5: 1, 21, 29, and 10. So there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

Node 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29:
These nodes all have 3 neighbors connected to them, so each forms only 1 3-star. 

Adding the total number of 3-stars from all relevant nodes: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of 21 3-stars in this graph:

[21]
