Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 6, node 10, and node 12. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these three nodes:

1. Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 11, 14)>
- <6, (5, 8, 4)>
- <10, (9, 1, 11)>
- <10, (1, 12, 0)>
- <12, (11, 5, 14)>
- <12, (5, 14, 0)>
