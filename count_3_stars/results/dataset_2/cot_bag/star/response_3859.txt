Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges: 
- 0: {14, 10, 11, 13}
- 1: {3, 14, 4, 8}
- 2: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- 3: {9, 1, 7, 2, 5}
- 4: {1, 8, 12, 13, 10, 5}
- 5: {3, 4, 2}
- 6: {9, 11, 13}
- 7: {3, 12, 14, 2, 13}
- 8: {9, 1, 4}
- 9: {6, 8, 10, 3}
- 10: {9, 4, 12, 0}
- 11: {6, 0, 13, 2}
- 12: {4, 7, 10}
- 13: {6, 4, 7, 0, 11}
- 14: {1, 7, 0}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the method described earlier:

1. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 4 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

Thus, inside brackets [], we have 50 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<4, (1, 8, 12)>
<4, (1, 10, 12)>
<4, (8, 10, 12)>
<7, (3, 12, 14)>
<7, (3, 12, 13)>
<7, (12, 14, 13)>
<7, (3, 13, 14)>
<13, (6, 0, 11)>
<13, (6, 2, 11)>
<13, (0, 11, 2)>
<13, (6, 11, 2)>
