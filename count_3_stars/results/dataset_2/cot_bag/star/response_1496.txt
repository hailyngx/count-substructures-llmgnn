Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (5, 9, 10, 13, 7)
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (8, 4, 6, 0, 13, 7)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (9, 8, 12, 0, 2)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 8, 1)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (5, 11, 14, 2)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (13, 12, 2, 1)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (5, 4, 2, 3)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (5, 4, 14, 3, 1)
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 1, 13)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (10, 2, 1, 14, 7)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (9, 6, 0, 13)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 94 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [94].
