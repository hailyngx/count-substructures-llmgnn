Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 8, 0, 9, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node.

2. Node 6: This node has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with this node.

3. Node 4: This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node.

4. Node 8: This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with this node.

5. Node 0: This node has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with this node.

6. Node 9: This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node.

7. Node 7: This node has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with this node.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
