Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (5, 16) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (19, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (15, 18) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 0) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of those nodes.

From the list of edges provided, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8, 17} (degree 3)
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 13, 14, 19} (degree 4)
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 16, 18} (degree 5)
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 10, 12, 13} (degree 4)
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 17} (degree 5)
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 12, 14} (degree 3)
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 11, 14, 15} (degree 4)
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 4, 9} (degree 3)
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 11, 12, 18} (degree 4)
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 12, 18} (degree 3)
- Node 16: Neighbors {2, 5, 17} (degree 3)
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 8, 16} (degree 3)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars centered at nodes with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each eligible node gives us:

1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 17)>, <1, (13, 14, 19)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <2, (0, 8, 16)>, <2, (0, 8, 18)>, <2, (3, 8, 16)>, <2, (8, 16, 18)>, <4, (8, 10, 13)>, <4, (8, 10, 12)>, <4, (10, 12, 13)>, <8, (0, 2, 17)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 17)>, <8, (4, 6, 17)>, <8, (6, 17, 4)>, <11, (3, 12, 14)>, <12, (4, 11, 14)>, <13, (1, 9, 14)>, <14, (1, 11, 18)>, <14, (11, 12, 18)>.
