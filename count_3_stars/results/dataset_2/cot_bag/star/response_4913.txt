Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (3, 20) (25, 18) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 22) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (15, 17) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 7) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 23) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 27) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (4, 10) (4, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (23, 26) (23, 28) (5, 1) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 9) (9, 11) (9, 20) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 24) (27, 22) (27, 19) (27, 16) (29, 10) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
1. Node 22 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
11. Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
12. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
13. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
16. Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, 21, 1>
<4, 10, 9>
<7, 12, 2>
<7, 14, 6>
<8, 2, 12>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 17, 15>
<9, 11, 10>
<11, 22, 1>
<12, 0, 24>
<14, 11, 10>
<16, 19, 27>
