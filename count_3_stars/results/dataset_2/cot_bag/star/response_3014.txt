Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with three or more neighbors: 4, 7, 14, 17, 10, 11, 6, 9, and 15.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 and 17 both have 3 neighbors, so each forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10, 11, 6, 9, and 15 all have 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the final count is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 15)>, <4, (0, 3, 16)>, <4, (0, 11, 13)>, <4, (2, 7, 1)>, <4, (2, 11, 13)>,
<4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (11, 3, 13)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <14, (11, 16, 17)>, <17, (5, 10, 14)>.
