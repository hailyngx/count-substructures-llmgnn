Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 14) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 87 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [87].

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
