Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective degrees are:  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 5: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 10: degree 3  
Node 11: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 4  
Node 13: degree 4  
Node 14: degree 4  

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is part of <4, (7, 13, 12)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (7, 11, 13)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (7, 11, 2)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (12, 13, 1)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (12, 13, 11)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (12, 11, 3)> 3-star
- Node 4 is part of <4, (12, 11, 13)> 3-star

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is part of <5, (9, 13, 2)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (9, 2, 8)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (9, 2, 14)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (9, 8, 14)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (13, 7, 2)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (13, 7, 14)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (13, 12, 7)> 3-star
- Node 5 is part of <5, (13, 12, 14)> 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
