Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6}

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 55 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>

For a total of 17 unique 3-stars.
