Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 9, 3
- Node 1: 13, 7, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5, 13, 12, 10, 11
- Node 3: 9, 0, 4, 10, 8
- Node 4: 14, 12, 3, 10, 1
- Node 5: 2, 11, 10
- Node 6: 9, 11, 12, 8
- Node 7: 9, 10, 1
- Node 8: 6, 14, 12, 1, 3
- Node 9: 6, 3, 7, 0
- Node 10: 5, 7, 4, 2, 3
- Node 11: 6, 5, 14, 2
- Node 12: 6, 4, 2, 8
- Node 13: 14, 2, 1
- Node 14: 4, 11, 8, 13

By examining the list, we can see that the nodes 1, 4, 8, and 14 each have exactly three neighbors, so there are four 3-stars formed with these nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (13, 7, 8)>
- <4, (14, 3, 10)>
- <8, (6, 12, 14)>
- <14, (4, 11, 13)>
