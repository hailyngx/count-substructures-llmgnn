Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 11) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 18) (0, 11) (0, 6) (7, 15) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 20 nodes, we first identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 15, 11, 6, 2, 19
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 12, 11
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 15, 0, 12
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 17, 8
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 5, 18
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 11, 6
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 15
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 12
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 18, 14
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 5, 10
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 15, 11, 8, 10
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 17, 9
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 17, 0, 19
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 13, 5, 2
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 13
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 9, 10
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 16, 12, 14, 5
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 4, 19, 2
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 13
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 17, 16, 4, 10

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
1. For nodes with 5 neighbors (like node 3), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. For nodes with 4 neighbors (like nodes 15, 11, 12, 17, 6, 10, 5), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each, so a total of \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \) 3-stars.
3. For nodes with 3 neighbors (like nodes 4, 13, 19), there is only 1 3-star each, so a total of 3 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 28 + 3 = 41 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].
