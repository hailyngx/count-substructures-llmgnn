Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 13) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 9) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 6) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 16) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1, 18, 7, 15  
Node 1: 17, 0  
Node 2: 9, 11, 18, 6  
Node 3: 11, 14, 19  
Node 4: 9  
Node 5: 9, 17, 16, 7  
Node 6: 10, 2, 15  
Node 7: 5, 0  
Node 8: 9, 19, 15  
Node 9: 5, 8, 4, 2  
Node 10: 6, 18  
Node 11: 3, 2  
Node 12: 16, 13  
Node 13: 12, 19, 16  
Node 14: 3, 15  
Node 15: 0, 8, 14, 6  
Node 16: 5, 12, 17, 19, 13  
Node 17: 5, 1, 16  
Node 18: 10, 2, 0  
Node 19: 3, 8, 13, 16  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:  
Node 0: [3]  
Node 1: [0]  
Node 2: [1]   
Node 3: [0]   
Node 5: [3]  
Node 6: [0]  
Node 7: [1]  
Node 8: [2]  
Node 9: [1]  
Node 10: [0]  
Node 11: [0]  
Node 12: [0]  
Node 13: [0]  
Node 15: [1]   
Node 16: [5]  
Node 17: [1]  
Node 18: [0]  
Node 19: [1]  

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated: [18]  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 15, 18)>  
<5, (7, 9, 17)>  
<8, (15, 16, 19)>  
<9, (2, 4, 8)>  
<16, (12, 13, 17)>
