Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 27) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 11) (20, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 23) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 1) (1, 12) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 23) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 18) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 21) (17, 9) (17, 22) (21, 20) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 15) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 10) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 18) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 29) (15, 11) (19, 21) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (18, 28) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 3) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (10, 20) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 27) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 15) (25, 24) (25, 18) 

Response:
We first note that not all nodes have three or more neighbors, so we will only consider those nodes when counting the number of 3-star subgraphs. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28.

Let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors, therefore no 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, therefore no 3-star.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 10: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 11: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 15: 5 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 18: 5 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 19: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 20: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 21: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 22: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 24: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 26: 3 neighbors, [1 3-star].
- Node 28: 4 neighbors, [1 3-star].

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us [17].
