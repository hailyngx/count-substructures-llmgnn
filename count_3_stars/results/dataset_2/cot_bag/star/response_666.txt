Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
Node 3: 2, 4, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 7: 0, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

Node 1: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 4: C(6, 3) = 20
Node 5: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 74

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>

<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
