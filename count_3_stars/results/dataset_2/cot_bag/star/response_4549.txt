Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
\[inom{15}{3} = 455\]

There are 15 nodes, but only nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Only 1 possible 3-star <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: 2 possible 3-stars <4, (5, 8, 13)> and <4, (0, 6, 13)>
- Node 5: Only 1 possible 3-star <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 8: 2 possible 3-stars <8, (0, 12, 14)> and <8, (4, 6, 13)>
- Node 9: Only 1 possible 3-star <9, (5, 7, 12)>
- Node 11: 1 possible 3-star <11, (1, 3, 14)>
- Node 12: 1 possible 3-star <12, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 13: 1 possible 3-star <13, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 14: 1 possible 3-star <14, (1, 7, 11)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
