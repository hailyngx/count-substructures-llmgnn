Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}

The 3-stars in this graph are:
- [17]
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>


So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
