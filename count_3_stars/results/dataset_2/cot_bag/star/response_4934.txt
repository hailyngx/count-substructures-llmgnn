Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (22, 9) (22, 10) (24, 7) (24, 13) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 9) (4, 28) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 8) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 4) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 29) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 26) (6, 15) (29, 14) (29, 11) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 12) (2, 27) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 21) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 7) (20, 27) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 8) (25, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 25) (5, 15) (5, 20) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors: {9, 26, 3}
- Node 1 with neighbors: {17, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 2 with neighbors: {27, 15, 3, 21}
- Node 4 with neighbors: {9, 28}
- Node 8 with neighbors: {9, 27, 25, 21}
- Node 10 with neighbors: {22, 15, 12, 13}
- Node 12 with neighbors: {26, 10, 1, 13}
- Node 13 with neighbors: {24, 10, 18, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25 \)

So, there are 25 3-stars in this graph when considering unique combinations. Thus, the final answer is [25].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (17, 11, 12)>

- <1, (11, 12, 18)>
- <2, (27, 15, 3)>
- <2, (27, 15, 21)>
- <2, (15, 3, 21)>
- <2, (27, 3, 21)>
- <8, (9, 27, 25)>
- <8, (9, 27, 21)>
