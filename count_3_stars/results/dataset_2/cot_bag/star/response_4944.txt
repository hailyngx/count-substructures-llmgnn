Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 1

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 5
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- We have 1 node with 5 neighbors, which contributes 1 3-star.
- We have 9 nodes with 4 neighbors, which contribute \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each, totaling 36 3-stars.
- We have 2 nodes with 3 neighbors, which contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each, totaling 2 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 36 + 2 = 39.

The unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 8, 13)>
<5, (0, 6, 10)>
<3, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (5, 0, 10)>
<8, (1, 4, 13)>
<9, (0, 11, 12)>
<10, (5, 6, 7)>
<11, (4, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 8, 13)>
<13, (1, 4, 8)>
<13, (2, 8, 14)>
<13, (7, 1, 2)>
