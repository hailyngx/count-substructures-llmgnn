Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 10, 9, 0
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9, 13, 7, 11
- Node 3: 7, 14, 12, 4
- Node 4: 3, 13, 0, 6
- Node 5: 12, 11, 0, 14
- Node 6: 8, 13, 0, 7, 11, 4
- Node 7: 3, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 11, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 12
- Node 10: 1, 13, 12
- Node 11: 2, 8, 5, 6
- Node 12: 3, 5, 9, 14, 10
- Node 13: 2, 4, 10, 6
- Node 14: 3, 5, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 each have three or more neighbors.
- For these nodes, the number of 3-stars formed is:
  - Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
  - Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
  - Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74], and they are:
<0, (1, 5, 4)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 10, 9)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>, <1, (10, 9, 0)>, <1, (5, 11, 6)>, 
<2, (8, 9, 13)>, <2, (8, 9, 12)>, <2, (8, 13, 12)>, <2, (8, 7, 11)>, 
<3, (7, 14, 12)>, 
<4, (13, 10, 6)>, 
<5, (12, 11, 14)>, <5, (12, 11, 0)>, <5, (12, 0, 14)>, <5, (11, 0, 14)>, 
<6, (8, 13, 11)>, <6, (8, 13, 4)>, <6, (8, 0, 7)>, <6, (13, 4, 0)>, 
<11, (8, 5, 6)>, <11, (8, 5, 6)>, 
<12, (9, 10, 14)>, <12, (9, 10, 6)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 14)>
