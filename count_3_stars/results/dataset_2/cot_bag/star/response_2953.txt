Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we will first check each node to see if it has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of \(10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 60 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
