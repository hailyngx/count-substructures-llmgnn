Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
```
       0
       |
       1 -- 7
      / \   |
     8 - 4--6
      \      /
        - 5 - 9
          |
          3
```
Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [50] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
