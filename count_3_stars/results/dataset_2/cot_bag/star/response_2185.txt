Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Considering every node, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0, 3), (0, 3, 7), (0, 6, 9), (0, 6, 8) => [4 Choose 3] = 4 3-stars
<Node 0, (6, 0, 3)>
<Node 0, (0, 3, 7)>
<Node 0, (0, 6, 9)>
<Node 0, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 8), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 2), (1, 5, 4) => [5 Choose 3] = 10 3-stars
<Node 1, (1, 3, 5)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 8)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 4)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 2)>
<Node 1, (1, 5, 4)>

Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 8), (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 2), (3, 5, 4), (3, 5, 8) => [6 Choose 3] = 20 3-stars
<Node 3, (3, 1, 5)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 8)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 4)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 2)>
<Node 3, (3, 5, 4)>
<Node 3, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (5, 1, 3), (5, 1, 4), (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 8), (5, 3, 4) => [5 Choose 3] = 10 3-stars
<Node 5, (5, 1, 3)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 4)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 2)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 8)>
<Node 5, (5, 3, 4)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9, 0) => 1 3-star
<Node 6, (6, 9, 0)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 3, 0), (7, 3, 8), (7, 3, 2), (7, 0, 8) => [4 Choose 3] = 4 3-stars
<Node 7, (7, 3, 0)>
<Node 7, (7, 3, 8)>
<Node 7, (7, 3, 2)>
<Node 7, (7, 0, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 1, 3), (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 2), (8, 3, 7) => [4 Choose 3] = 4 3-stars
<Node 8, (8, 1, 3)>
<Node 8, (8, 1, 7)>
<Node 8, (8, 1, 2)>
<Node 8, (8, 3, 7)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 6, 2) => 1 3-star
<Node 9, (9, 6, 2)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 54
So, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<Node 0, (6, 0, 3)>
<Node 0, (0, 3, 7)>
<Node 0, (0, 6, 9)>
<Node 0, (0, 6, 8)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 5)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 8)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 4)>
<Node 1, (1, 3, 2)>
<Node 1, (1, 5, 4)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 5)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 8)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 4)>
<Node 3, (3, 1, 2)>
<Node 3, (3, 5, 4)>
<Node 3, (3, 5, 8)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 3)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 4)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 2)>
<Node 5, (5, 1, 8)>
<Node 5, (5, 3, 4)>
<Node 6, (6, 9, 0)>
<Node 7, (7, 3, 0)>
<Node 7, (7, 3, 8)>
<Node 7, (7, 3, 2)>
<Node 7, (7, 0, 8)>
<Node 8, (8, 1, 3)>
<Node 8, (8, 1, 7)>
<Node 8, (8, 1, 2)>
<Node 8, (8, 3, 7)>
<Node 9, (9, 6, 2)>
