Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 26) (10, 18) (11, 3) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (3, 11) (3, 5) (27, 8) (27, 19) (27, 13) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 16) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 15) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 8) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 23) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 15) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 25) (14, 21) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 22) (22, 16) (22, 2) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (6, 26) (24, 19) (1, 29) (1, 7) (1, 0) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (21, 5) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 1) (23, 4) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 21) (25, 14) (25, 2) (28, 14) (28, 2) (28, 15) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be found as follows:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 3, 19, 26, 16, 21. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5.
  <5, (3, 19, 26)>, <5, (3, 19, 16)>, <5, (3, 19, 21)>, <5, (3, 26, 16)>, <5, (3, 26, 21)>, <5, (3, 16, 21)>, <5, (19, 26, 16)>, <5, (19, 26, 21)>, <5, (19, 16, 21)>, <5, (26, 16, 21)>

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: nodes 10, 4, 20, 12. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 18.
  <18, (10, 4, 20)>, <18, (10, 4, 12)>, <18, (10, 20, 12)>, <18, (4, 20, 12)>

- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: nodes 27, 17, 12, 2, 23. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 13.
  <13, (27, 17, 12)>, <13, (27, 17, 2)>, <13, (27, 17, 23)>, <13, (27, 12, 2)>, <13, (27, 12, 23)>, <13, (27, 2, 23)>, <13, (17, 12, 2)>, <13, (17, 12, 23)>, <13, (17, 2, 23)>, <13, (12, 2, 23)>

- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: nodes 9, 1, 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 29.
  <29, (9, 1, 8)>

- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 14, 7, 22. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 16.
  <16, (5, 14, 7)>, <16, (5, 14, 22)>, <16, (5, 7, 22)>, <16, (14, 7, 22)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 29 3-stars in this graph:
[29].
