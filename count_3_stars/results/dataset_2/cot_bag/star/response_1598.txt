Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 28) (14, 17) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 27) (17, 11) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 29) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 15) (28, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 21) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 7) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 23) (2, 16) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 26) (25, 7) (0, 10) (0, 23) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 20) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 26) (20, 1) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 26) (23, 2) (23, 0) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) (24, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes forms. Finally, we'll sum up the total count of 3-stars.

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 21, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {22, 3, 8, 24}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17, 18, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {12, 4, 9, 6}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 17, 6, 1, 26}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 19, 28}
- Node 17: Neighbors {14, 16, 5, 27, 11}
- Node 19: Neighbors {15, 5, 2, 10, 9}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 10, 9}
- Node 22: Neighbors {13, 18, 2, 4, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors {7, 11, 16}
- Node 27: Neighbors {17, 12}
- Node 29: Neighbors {13, 18, 12}

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars each of these nodes forms:
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 5 3-stars
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 17: 5 3-stars
- Node 19: 5 3-stars
- Node 21: 1 3-star
- Node 22: 5 3-stars
- Node 26: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star
- Node 29: 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes listed above, we have:
1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (15, 21, 4)>
- <4, (22, 3, 8)>
- <5, (17, 18, 19)>
- <8, (12, 4, 9)>
- <11, (13, 17, 6)>
- <15, (3, 19, 28)>
- <17, (14, 16, 5)>
- <19, (15, 2, 10)>
- <21, (3, 10, 9)>
- <22, (13, 18, 2)>
- <26, (7, 11, 16)>
- <27, (17, 12)>
- <29, (13, 18, 12)>
