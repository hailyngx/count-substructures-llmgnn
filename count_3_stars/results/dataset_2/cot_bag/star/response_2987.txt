Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 9, 4, 2, 7
- Node 1: 9, 3, 8, 7
- Node 2: 5, 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7, 6
- Node 4: 5, 9, 8, 0
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 4
- Node 6: 5, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 0, 2
- Node 8: 5, 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5, 4, 1, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 7, 9)>,
