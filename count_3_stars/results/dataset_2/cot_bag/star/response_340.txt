Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 4) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, and 12.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (3, 5, 6, 11, 12) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (1, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14) -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (3, 8, 9, 12) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 7, 12) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 5, 6, 3) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: (1, 5, 7, 9) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58 3-stars

Thus, the final answer is [58].
