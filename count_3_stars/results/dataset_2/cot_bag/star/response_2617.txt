Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (10, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 19) (12, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 1) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 3, 5, 17, 4, 8, 14, 2, 13, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found:
<14, (3, 11, 19)>
<2, (7, 13, 17)>
<3, (11, 14, 19)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 15)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<13, (2, 6, 7)>
<17, (2, 6, 11)>
