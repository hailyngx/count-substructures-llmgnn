Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (16, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (14, 18) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 19) 

Response:
The nodes have the following degrees:  
0: 4  
1: 4  
2: 3  
3: 2  
4: 5  
5: 3  
6: 4  
7: 3  
8: 4  
9: 2  
10: 3  
11: 2  
12: 5  
13: 3  
14: 2  
15: 3  
16: 1  
17: 3  
18: 4  
19: 2  

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars and list them:  
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:  
<4, (0, 5, 10)>,  
<4, (0, 6, 10)>,  
<4, (5, 6, 10)>,  
<4, (6, 8, 10)>,  
<4, (0, 5, 6)>,  
<4, (0, 5, 10)>,  
<4, (0, 4, 6)>,  
<4, (4, 5, 6)>,  
<4, (4, 5, 10)>,  
<4, (4, 6, 10)>  

- Node 12 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:  
<12, (0, 6, 19)>,  
<12, (6, 8, 19)>,  
<12, (6, 12, 19)>,  
<12, (6, 12, 19)>,  
<12, (0, 12, 19)>,  
<12, (6, 12, 19)>,  
<12, (12, 18, 19)>,  
<12, (6, 12, 19)>,  
<12, (18, 19, 3)>,  
<12, (18, 19, 12)>  

Putting this together, we get a total of [20] 3-stars.
