Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: node 4, node 7, and node 0. 

For node 4:
- It has 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 13, 3
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 9, 13)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 13, 3)>, <4, (9, 13, 3)>

For node 7:
- It has 5 neighbors: 4, 0, 11, 9, 13
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (4, 0, 11)>, <7, (4, 0, 9)>, <7, (4, 0, 13)>, <7, (4, 11, 9)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (4, 9, 13)>, <7, (0, 11, 9)>, <7, (0, 11, 13)>, <7, (0, 9, 13)>, <7, (11, 9, 13)>

For node 0:
- It has 5 neighbors: 7, 2, 12, 1, 6
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (7, 2, 12)>, <0, (7, 2, 1)>, <0, (7, 2, 6)>, <0, (7, 12, 1)>, <0, (7, 12, 6)>, <0, (7, 1, 6)>, <0, (2, 12, 1)>, <0, (2, 12, 6)>, <0, (2, 1, 6)>, <0, (12, 1, 6)>

Final total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 = 24]
