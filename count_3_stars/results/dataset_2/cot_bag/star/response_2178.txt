Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 17, 14, 0, 2, 8, 3, 11, 5, 13, 10, 15, 18, 16, 1, and 12.

Since each of these nodes can form a 3-star, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8. Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
11. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
12. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
13. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
14. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
15. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
16. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, we have a total of 28 3-stars. 

Therefore, putting the final number inside brackets [] gives us: [28]

The unique 3-stars found are:
