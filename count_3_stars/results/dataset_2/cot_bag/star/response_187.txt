Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 10) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 5) (7, 2) (19, 17) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, 17, 15, 14, 3, 10, 18, 0, and 13.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (2, 12, 7)>
<9, (6, 14, 1)>
<6, (9, 12, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 10, 3)>
<3, (8, 4, 10)>
<10, (8, 16, 3)>
<18, (5, 15, 0)>
<0, (17, 4, 18)>
<13, (3, 10, 18)>
