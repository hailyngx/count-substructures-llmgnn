Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors  
Node 1 has 2 neighbors  
Node 4 has 5 neighbors  
Node 7 has 3 neighbors  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors  
Node 13 has 6 neighbors  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors  
Node 11 has 5 neighbors  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
Node 12 has 4 neighbors  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
Node 10 has 5 neighbors  
Node 0 has 2 neighbors  
Node 14 has 5 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 74 \)

Therefore, there are 74 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [74].

Examples of the unique 3-stars found in this graph:   
<6, (1, 8, 14)>  
<9, (4, 12, 14)>  
<4, (7, 8, 13)>  
<13, (1, 3, 4)>  
<3, (0, 11, 14)>  
<11, (2, 8, 13)>  
<2, (4, 10, 12)>  
<12, (2, 5, 13)>  
<10, (0, 2, 14)>
