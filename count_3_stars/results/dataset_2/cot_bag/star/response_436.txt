Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {7, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 8, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 2, 1}

Since we have the information about each node's neighbors, we can now calculate the number of 3-star graphs in this configuration. 

- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Combining all the 3-stars formed by each node, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48.  

Therefore, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 2)>, <1, (7, 8, 2)>, <1, (7, 6, 2)>.
