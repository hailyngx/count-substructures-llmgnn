Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 24) (22, 13) (22, 10) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (9, 6) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 29) (8, 27) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 14) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 3) (28, 14) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (27, 4) (27, 8) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (15, 23) (15, 1) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (10, 22) (10, 5) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 12) (3, 28) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 5) (24, 13) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 25) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 20) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 12) (29, 13) (29, 8) (20, 27) (20, 16) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) (25, 24) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, and we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 29 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 20 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with itself as the center. 
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 
Node 25 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star with itself as the center. 

Adding up all these 3-stars yields a total of \(10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
