Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by constructing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 7), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 2), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 5), (0, 1), (0, 5)

Now, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 8, 9}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors {4, 5, 6, 9, 2}. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has neighbors {4, 6, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has neighbors {1, 5}. It forms no 3-star.

Total 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 38. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38]. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>
