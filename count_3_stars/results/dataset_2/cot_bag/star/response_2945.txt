Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
There are several crucial aspects to consider when calculating the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

1. Identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 24, 10, and 19
   - Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 15, 17, 9, 16, 21
   - Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 14, 13, 22, 11
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 8, 7, 0
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 21, 26
   - Node 21 has 5 neighbors: 14, 8, 6, 0, 4
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 22, 21, 4, 20
   - Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 6, 13, 1, 18, 9
   - Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 3, 0, 12, 4, 16
   - Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 11, 24, 23

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
   - For nodes 3, 14, 17, 21, and 10, we can form 1 3-star for each as they have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them, resulting in 5 3-stars.
   - For nodes 6, 8, and 20, we can form \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each, as they have exactly 5 neighbors. This results in 30 3-stars.
   - For node 27, we can form \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it.

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
   - Total = 5 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 30 (from nodes with 5 neighbors) + 1 (from node 27) = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 10, 19)>
<14, (15, 17, 9)>
<17, (14, 13, 22)>
<21, (14, 8, 6)>
<10, (3, 0, 12)>
<6, (22, 21, 4)>
<8, (2, 21, 26)>
<20, (6, 13, 1)>
<27, (11, 24, 23)>
