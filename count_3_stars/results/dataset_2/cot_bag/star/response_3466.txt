Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 9, 13, 4, 14, 12
- Node 1: 8, 14, 11, 12
- Node 2: 8, 13, 6, 12
- Node 3: 8, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 8, 0, 14, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 11
- Node 6: 5, 10, 3, 2
- Node 7: 3, 10
- Node 8: 13, 4, 2, 3, 1
- Node 9: 5, 10, 0, 12
- Node 10: 9, 13, 6, 7
- Node 11: 5, 14, 1
- Node 12: 9, 13, 2, 0, 1
- Node 13: 8, 12, 2, 10, 0
- Node 14: 8, 4, 11, 1, 0

By observing the list of neighboring nodes for each node, we can see that there are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which means this graph has 6 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 9, 13, 12>
2. <1, 8, 13, 12>
3. <2, 8, 13, 12>
4. <3, 8, 4, 14>
5. <5, 9, 6, 11>
6. <6, 10, 3, 2>
