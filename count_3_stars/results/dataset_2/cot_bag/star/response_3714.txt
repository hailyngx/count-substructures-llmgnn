Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 19) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 10) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 17)>, <4, (2, 9, 6)>, <10, (5, 19, 18)>, <11, (10, 16, 15)>, <15, (11, 3, 17)>, <16, (11, 8, 17)>, <17, (15, 2, 0)>, <18, (10, 19, 13)>, <19, (18, 8, 0)>
