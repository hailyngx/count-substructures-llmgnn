Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 38 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 3)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 3)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 0, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 0, 7)>
- <4, (6, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (6, 8, 2)>
