Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 17) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 10) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 1:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 2:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 3:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 4:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
12. Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
13. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 27 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
