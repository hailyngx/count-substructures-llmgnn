Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 16) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (17, 1) (17, 4) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (13, 9) (18, 6) (19, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 15) (16, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's identify these nodes and count the number of 3-stars formed by each one:

1. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (4, 15).
2. Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 16, 17, 6).
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 9, 11).
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (5, 15, 18).
5. Node 8 has 5 neighbors (2, 11, 12, 14, 15).
6. Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 11, 13, 5).
7. Node 12 has 5 neighbors (7, 8, 10, 14, 19).
8. Node 14 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 12).
9. Node 15 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8).
10. Node 16 has 2 neighbors (4, 15).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58, indicated as [58].
