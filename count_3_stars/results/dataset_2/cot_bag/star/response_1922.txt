Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14. We'll find the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 4 neighbors of node 0 which form 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 12, 13)>
So, there is [1] 3-star with node 0 as the center.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2 which form 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
<2, (3, 9, 13)>, <2, (3, 9, 10)>, <2, (3, 10, 13)>, <2, (9, 10, 13)>
So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 3:
There are 6 neighbors of node 3 which form 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
<3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 11)>, <3, (1, 8, 5)>, <3, (1, 8, 3)>, <3, (1, 11, 5)>, <3, (1, 11, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 11)>, <3, (5, 6, 13)>, <3, (6, 13, 7)>, <3, (9, 10, 14)>
So, there are [10] 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

For node 4:
There are 5 neighbors of node 4 which form 9 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
<4, (0, 6, 13)>, <4, (0, 6, 14)>, <4, (0, 9, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 11)>, <4, (6, 13, 7)>, <4, (7, 11, 14)>, <4, (7, 13, 11)>, <4, (7, 13, 14)>, <4, (9, 10, 14)>
So, there are [9] 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors of node 5 which form 6 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
<5, (1, 3, 11)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 3)>, <5, (3, 6, 11)>, <5, (6, 7, 11)>, <5, (6, 11, 7)>
So, there are [6] 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

For node 6:
There are 4 neighbors of node 6 which form 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (3, 5, 13)>, <6, (4, 7, 13)>, <6, (5, 11, 7)>, <6, (7, 13, 4)>
So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For node 7:
There are 5 neighbors of node 7 which form 8 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
<7, (4, 11, 14)>, <7, (4, 13, 11)>, <7, (11, 5, 14)>, <7, (13, 4, 14)>, <7, (13, 11, 14)>, <7, (13, 14, 4)>, <7, (13, 14, 1)>, <7, (14, 11, 1)>
So, there are [8] 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

For node 9:
There are 5 neighbors of node 9 which form 5 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
<9, (3, 10, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <9, (4, 13, 10)>, <9, (10, 14, 4)>, <9, (13, 0, 4)>
So, there are [5] 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

For node 10:
There are 3 neighbors of node 10 which form 1 3-star with node 10 as the center: <10, (9, 14, 4)>
So, there is [1] 3-star with node 10 as the center.

For node 11:
There are 4 neighbors of node 11 which form 3 3-stars with node 11 as the center:
<11, (5, 7, 14)>, <11, (5, 6, 7)>, <11, (7, 14, 13)>
So, there are [3] 3-stars with node 11 as the center.

For node 13:
There are 4 neighbors of node 13 which form 3 3-stars with node 13 as the center:
<13, (4, 7, 14)>, <13, (7, 14, 1)>, <13, (9, 0, 4)>
So, there are [3] 3-stars with node 13 as the center.

For node 14:
There are 5 neighbors of node 14 which form 6 3-stars with node 14 as the center:
<14, (0, 9, 13)>, <14, (4, 7, 13)>, <14, (7, 11, 1)>, <14, (7, 13, 1)>, <14, (9, 10, 4)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>
So, there are [6] 3-stars with node 14 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of [56] 3-stars in this graph.
