Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 110 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [110].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, 0, 6>
- <2, 5, 12>
- <2, 6, 12>
- <2, 9, 8>
- <3, 1, 11>
- <3, 2, 5>
- <4, 5, 14>
- <5, 2, 6>
- <5, 4, 14>
- <6, 0, 14>
- <7, 6, 12>
- <8, 1, 10>
- <8, 10, 11>
- <11, 7, 1>
- <13, 3, 7>
- <14, 0, 12>
