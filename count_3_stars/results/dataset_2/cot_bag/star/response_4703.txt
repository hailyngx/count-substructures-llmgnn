Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 7}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 2: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 4: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors
- Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 7: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 8: $ \binom{6}{3} = 20$
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each applicable node: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
