Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 18) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: 11, 16, and 9. 

For node 11: 
- There are 3 neighbors (3, 19, 4), so there is 1 3-star formed with this node. 
- Thus, we have <11, (3, 19, 4)>. 

For node 16:
- There are 3 neighbors (7, 13, 18), so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Thus, we have <16, (7, 13, 18)>. 

For node 9:
- There are 4 neighbors (3, 4, 10, 0), so there are 1 3-stars formed with this node.
- Thus, we have <9, (3, 4, 10)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
