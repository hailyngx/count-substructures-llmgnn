Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 0) (9, 28) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 8) (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 17) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 25) (0, 9) (0, 5) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 5) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 25) (20, 17) (25, 29) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 24) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 18) (28, 9) (28, 26) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 21) (3, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (21, 23) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 12) (5, 0) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 27) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 10) (12, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars found for each node gives a total of 52 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, 5, 27>
<2, 11, 14>
<4, 19, 27>
<13, 20, 22>
<16, 26, 3>
<17, 19, 7>
<18, 8, 11>
<20, 17, 29>
<21, 2, 4>
<23, 1, 24>
<25, 1, 6>
<29, 17, 13>
