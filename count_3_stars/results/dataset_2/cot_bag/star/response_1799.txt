Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
We'll first draw the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Edges:
- Node 0: {4, 12, 13, 11, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 12, 5, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 2, 12, 0, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 10, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 14, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 11, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 13, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {13, 2, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 12, 10, 14, 0}
- Node 14: {13, 11, 1, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 12, Node 13

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 12, 13)>
<2, (6, 9, 12)>
<3, (4, 2, 12)>
<4, (7, 0, 10)>
<6, (7, 2, 11)>
<12, (13, 2, 0)>
<13, (9, 8, 12)>
