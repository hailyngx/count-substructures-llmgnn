Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Given the number of nodes and edges, we can construct the graph and determine the 3-stars formed:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9. It has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5. The 3-stars are:
    <5, (1, 2, 4)>, 
    <5, (1, 2, 7)>, 
    <5, (1, 2, 8)>, 
    <5, (1, 2, 9)>, 
    <5, (1, 4, 7)>, 
    <5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
    <5, (1, 4, 9)>, 
    <5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
    <5, (1, 7, 9)>, 
    <5, (1, 8, 9)>, 
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>, 
    <5, (2, 4, 8)>, 
    <5, (2, 4, 9)>, 
    <5, (2, 7, 8)>, 
    <5, (2, 7, 9)>, 
    <5, (2, 8, 9)>, 
    <5, (4, 7, 8)>, 
    <5, (4, 7, 9)>, 
    <5, (4, 8, 9)>, 
    <5, (7, 8, 9)>.

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, but only 4 of them can form a 3-star with node 4 because one node is missing. Therefore, node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
    <4, (1, 6, 7)>, 
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>, 
    <4, (1, 6, 3)>, 
    <4, (6, 7, 8)>.

- Node 7 has the same situation as node 4, it can also form 4 3-stars:
    <7, (3, 4, 9)>, 
    <7, (3, 9, 2)>, 
    <7, (3, 9, 0)>, 
    <7, (4, 9, 2)>.

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [28].
