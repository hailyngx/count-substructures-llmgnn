Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We have the following nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 15, 2, 23, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 25, 24, 29)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 3, 13, 18, 10)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 21, 16, 29, 23)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 7, 27)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 6, 20, 17)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 25, 4)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 21, 0, 2)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 22, 24, 18, 5, 23)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 3, 26, 12, 1)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 24, 14, 10)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 8, 4)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 25, 26)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 22, 19, 15)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 6, 7, 26)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 9, 7)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 26, 29)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 6, 11, 19)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 11, 15, 12)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 3, 7, 5)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 9, 0)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 24, 19, 14)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 8, 2)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 1, 12, 2)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 13, 17, 10)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 25, 1, 4, 2)

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21 can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star
- Node 27 can form 1 3-star
- Node 26 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 17 can form 1 3-star
- Node 18 can form 1 3-star
- Node 11 can form 1 3-star
- Node 23 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 can form 1 3-star
- Node 19 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29 can form 1 3-star
- Node 28 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star
- Node 20 can form 1 3-star
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].
