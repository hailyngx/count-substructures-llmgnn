Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 10) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 8, 13, 5, 0, 7, 2, 12, 6, 11, 14, 10, 3, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 84.
