Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 17) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 13) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 25) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 3) (11, 21) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 17) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 24) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 3) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 14) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 5) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 13) (9, 0) (9, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (25, 9) (3, 18) (3, 26) (3, 24) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 23) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 21) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 13) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph.
Let's analyze these nodes to find the 3-stars:

Node 21:
This node has 6 neighbors: 7, 23, 11, 2, 14, 21. This allows us to form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
<21, (7, 11, 2)>
<21, (7, 11, 14)>
<21, (7, 11, 21)>
<21, (7, 2, 14)>
<21, (7, 2, 21)>
<21, (7, 14, 21)>
<21, (11, 2, 14)>
<21, (11, 2, 21)>
<21, (11, 14, 21)>
<21, (2, 14, 21)>

Node 27:
This node has 3 neighbors: 12, 17, 1. This allows us to form 1 3-star.
<27, (12, 17, 1)>

Node 0:
This node has 4 neighbors: 20, 16, 9, 26. This allows us to form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<0, (20, 16, 9)>
<0, (20, 16, 26)>
<0, (20, 9, 26)>
<0, (16, 9, 26)>

Node 2:
This node has 4 neighbors: 21, 8, 6, 25. This allows us to form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<2, (21, 8, 6)>
<2, (21, 8, 25)>
<2, (21, 6, 25)>
<2, (8, 6, 25)>

Node 8:
This node has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 19, 22. This allows us to form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<8, (7, 2, 19)>
<8, (7, 2, 22)>
<8, (7, 19, 22)>
<8, (2, 19, 22)>

Node 4:
This node has 4 neighbors: 18, 19, 14, 29. This allows us to form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<4, (18, 19, 14)>
<4, (18, 19, 29)>
<4, (18, 14, 29)>
<4, (19, 14, 29)>

Node 18:
This node has 3 neighbors: 4, 19, 3. This allows us to form 1 3-star.
<18, (4, 19, 3)>

Node 10:
This node has 3 neighbors: 29, 15, 16. This allows us to form 1 3-star.
<10, (29, 15, 16)>

Node 5:
This node has 3 neighbors: 1, 22, 24. This allows us to form 1 3-star.
<5, (1, 22, 24)>

Node 26:
This node has 3 neighbors: 0, 23, 3. This allows us to form 1 3-star.
<26, (0, 23, 3)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 41 3-stars.
