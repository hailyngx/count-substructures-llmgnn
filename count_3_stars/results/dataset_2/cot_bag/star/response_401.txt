Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (0, 8) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided information:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
- Edges: (11, 16), (11, 13), (11, 5), (16, 7), (16, 17), (16, 4), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (9, 7), (14, 3), (14, 5), (17, 8), (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 15), (12, 2), (12, 19), (5, 6), (5, 14), (5, 19), (5, 3), (19, 3), (19, 13), (8, 10), (8, 0), (1, 15), (1, 18), (15, 4), (2, 10), (4, 15), (10, 18)

Now, we'll analyze each node to count the 3-stars:

Node 0: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star.
Node 1: {6, 15, 18}
Node 2: {6, 10, 12}
Node 3: {5, 14, 19}
Node 4: {15, 16, 2}
Node 5: {3, 11, 14}
Node 6: {1, 2, 5}
Node 7: {9, 12, 15}
Node 8: {0, 10, 17}
Node 9: {7}
Node 10: {2, 8, 13, 18}
Node 11: {5, 13, 16}
Node 12: {7, 2, 19}
Node 13: {10, 11, 19}
Node 14: {3, 5}
Node 15: {1, 4, 7}
Node 16: {4, 11, 17}
Node 17: {8, 16}
Node 18: {1, 10}
Node 19: {3, 5, 12, 13}

Now we count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 3 3-stars
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 3 3-stars
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 3-stars
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 3 3-stars

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [32] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found:

<1, 6, 18>
<1, 15, 4>
