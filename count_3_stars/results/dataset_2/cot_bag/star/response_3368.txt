Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 14) (12, 19) (12, 14) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
In this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors in order to find the number of 3-stars formed.

The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 19.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 35 3-stars ([]).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 14, 16)>, <3, (0, 14, 18)>, <3, (4, 14, 10)>, <3, (14, 18, 13)>, <4, (7, 11, 10)>, <8, (2, 19, 15)>, <8, (6, 2, 17)>, <8, (19, 15, 13)>, <8, (19, 15, 19)>, <10, (7, 11, 4)>, <10, (7, 11, 4)>, <10, (7, 11, 4)>, <10, (7, 11, 4)>, <10, (13, 15, 19)>, <14, (3, 10, 19)>, <14, (3, 10, 19)>, <14, (3, 12, 19)>, <14, (10, 19, 13)>, <14, (10, 19, 13)>, <19, (8, 15, 13)>
