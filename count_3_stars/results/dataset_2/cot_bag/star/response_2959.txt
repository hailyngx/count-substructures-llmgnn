Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 4) (10, 15) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 19) (3, 8) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 12) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 16, 7, 1
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 11, 18, 12, 10, 15
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 11, 18, 19
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 17, 8, 13
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 7, 6, 17, 3
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 7, 15, 12
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 16, 5, 4
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 4, 1, 10, 9
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 11, 0, 2
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 17, 14, 19
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star per node (total 6 3-stars)
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 15: 4 3-stars
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars together: 
6 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 36 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 7>
<4, 10, 12>
<4, 10, 15>
<4, 12, 15>
<4, 15, 9>
<5, 11, 18>
<6, 13, 17>
<8, 13, 19>
<13, 17, 19>
<13, 6, 8>
