Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 9) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 19) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 20 nodes and the given edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Edges:
(11, 10) (11, 2)
(16, 8) (16, 9)
(5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17)
(9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10)
(3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4)
(15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7)
(4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17)
(7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17)
(10, 11) (10, 9)
(1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18)
(14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8)
(17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14)
(2, 11) (2, 18)
(18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2)
(8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6)
(19, 1) (19, 0)
(0, 19)
(6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13)
(12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1)
(13, 7) (13, 6)
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <5, (9, 12, 17)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <9, (5, 4, 10)>, <9, (4, 3, 15)>, <9, (3, 15, 7)>, <9, (15, 7, 4)>, <9, (15, 7, 17)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <3, (4, 15, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <4, (9, 7, 17)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <15, (9, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <7, (15, 4, 17)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
    - <14, (17, 8, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 28 \).

Therefore, the answer is [28].
