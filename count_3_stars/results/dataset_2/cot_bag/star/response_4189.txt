Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 25) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 26) (6, 28) (6, 25) (28, 6) (28, 23) (19, 26) (19, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (2, 4) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 20) (20, 5) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 29) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 27) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 22) (29, 24) (14, 12) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 29) (22, 7) (22, 29) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are 16 nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {(9, 26, 17), (9, 26, 16)}
2. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {(26, 9, 17), (26, 9, 16), (26, 19, 29), (26, 19, 6)}
3. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {(5, 0, 7)}
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {(3, 15, 1)}
5. Node 15 has 3 neighbors: {(15, 3, 1)}
6. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {(1, 3, 15), (1, 3, 13), (1, 15, 23)}
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {(7, 5, 20), (7, 5, 12), (7, 5, 29), (7, 5, 22), (7, 12, 20)}
8. Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {(12, 7, 20), (12, 7, 24), (12, 7, 14), (12, 7, 19), (12, 20, 24)}
9. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {(6, 26, 25), (6, 28, 23)}
10. Node 19 has 5 neighbors: {(19, 26, 17), (19, 26, 24), (19, 26, 27), (19, 12, 17), (19, 12, 24)}
11. Node 2 has 2 neighbors with 0 3-stars.
12. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {(18, 2, 10), (18, 2, 16), (18, 10, 27), (18, 10, 0)}
13. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {(17, 9, 8), (17, 9, 19), (17, 20, 7), (17, 20, 19)}
14. Node 20 has 4 neighbors: {(20, 5, 7), (20, 7, 12), (20, 7, 17), (20, 17, 7)}
15. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: {(16, 9, 29)}
16. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {(10, 4, 18)}

Adding all the 3-stars found for each node together, we get a total of [37] unique 3-stars:
<9, 26, 17>, <9, 26, 16>, <26, 19, 29>, <26, 19, 6>, <5, 0, 7>, <3, 15, 1>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 15, 23>, <7, 5, 20>, <7, 5, 12>, <7, 5, 29>, <7, 5, 22>, <7, 12, 20>, <12, 7, 24>, <12, 7, 14>, <12, 7, 19>, <12, 20, 24>, <6, 26, 25>, <6, 28, 23>, <19, 26, 24>, <19, 26, 27>, <19, 12, 17>, <19, 12, 24>, <18, 2, 10>, <18, 2, 16>, <18, 10, 27>, <18, 10, 0>, <17, 9, 8>, <17, 9, 19>, <17, 20, 7>, <17, 20, 19>, <20, 5, 7>, <20, 7, 12>, <20, 7, 17>, <20, 17, 7>, <16, 9, 29>, <10, 4, 18>
