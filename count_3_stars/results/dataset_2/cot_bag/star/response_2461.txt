Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 21) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (15, 20) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 19) (24, 26) (24, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (26, 25) (28, 14) (28, 23) (28, 18) (16, 15) (16, 20) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 29) (12, 3) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 7) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (22, 20) (22, 19) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 10) (29, 14) (29, 12) (29, 1) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 11) (7, 5) (0, 21) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 19) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 13) (5, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 6, 9, 8, 23, 2, and 18.
  
For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 7, and 23.
- There is a 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (9, 23, 7)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 21, and 0.
- There is a 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (6, 21, 0)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 23, 20, 26, and 7.
- There are 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (23, 20, 26)>, <8, (23, 20, 7)>, <8, (23, 26, 7)>, <8, (20, 26, 7)>.

For node 23:
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 6, 8, 18, 7, and 28.
- There are 10 3-stars with node 23 as the center: <23, (6, 8, 18)>, <23, (6, 8, 7)>, <23, (6, 8, 28)>, <23, (6, 18, 7)>, <23, (6, 18, 28)>, <23, (6, 7, 28)>, <23, (8, 18, 7)>, <23, (8, 18, 28)>, <23, (8, 7, 28)>, <23, (18, 7, 28)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 18, 12, 27, and 4.
- There are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (18, 12, 27)>, <2, (18, 12, 4)>, <2, (18, 27, 4)>, <2, (12, 27, 4)>.

For node 18:
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 23, 2, 28, and 25.
- There are 4 3-stars with node 18 as the center: <18, (23, 2, 28)>, <18, (23, 2, 25)>, <18, (23, 28, 25)>, <18, (2, 28, 25)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 24.
