Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: 3-star count = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: 3-star count = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: 3-star count = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: 3-star count = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: 3-star count = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: 3-star count = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: 3-star count = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: 3-star count = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: 3-star count = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: 3-star count = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up:
\( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 43 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [43]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
