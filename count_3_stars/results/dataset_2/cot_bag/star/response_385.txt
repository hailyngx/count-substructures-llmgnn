Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 68 \]

So, there are 68 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (5, 1, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 5)>
<6, (8, 0, 9)>
<6, (8, 0, 5)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (8, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 6)>
