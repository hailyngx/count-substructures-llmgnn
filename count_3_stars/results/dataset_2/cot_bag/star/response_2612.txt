Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 : 5 neighbors
- Node 1 : 4 neighbors
- Node 3 : 2 neighbors
- Node 4 : 3 neighbors
- Node 5 : 4 neighbors
- Node 7 : 4 neighbors
- Node 8 : 4 neighbors
- Node 9 : 4 neighbors
- Node 11 : 3 neighbors
- Node 12 : 3 neighbors
- Node 14 : 4 neighbors
- Node 15: 2 neighbors
- Node 16: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 2 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 19 form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Nodes 4, 11, and 12 form 1 3-star each.

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 8 \times 4 + 3 = 35 \) 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [35].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 19)>, <1, (0, 2, 14)>, <5, (2, 7, 10)>, <7, (0, 5, 19)>, <8, (0, 6, 18)>, <9, (5, 12, 14)>, <11, (3, 4, 19)>, <14, (1, 9, 10)>
