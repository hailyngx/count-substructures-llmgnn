Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 4, 8, 14
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 3, 8, 13
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7
- 3-stars: [1, (2, 4, 8)]

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8, 0
- 3-stars: [1, (2, 4, 8)]

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 8, 0, 14, 7
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 2, 11, 12
- 3-stars: [1, (2, 4, 8)]

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 3, 10, 9, 5
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 2, 5, 0
- 3-stars: [1, (2, 4, 8)]

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 10
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 10:
- Neighbors: 14, 7, 9
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 11:
- Neighbors: 6, 13, 12
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 12:
- Neighbors: 6, 11, 13, 9
- 3-stars: [1]

Node 13:
- Neighbors: 2, 0, 11, 12, 9
- 3-stars: [1, (2, 4, 8)]

Node 14:
- Neighbors: 1, 0, 5, 10
- 3-stars: [1]

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get:
\[ [1] + [1] + [1, (2, 4, 8)] + [1, (2, 4, 8)] + [1] + [1, (2, 4, 8)] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1] + [1, (2, 4, 8)] + [1] = [13] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 13. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
