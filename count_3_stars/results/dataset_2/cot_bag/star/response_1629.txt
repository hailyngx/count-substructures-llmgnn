Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (17, 12) (17, 13) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) (11, 12) (11, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 19.
Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: \( 10+4+0+0+4+10+4+4+4+1 = 41 \)

Therefore, there are 41 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 4, 6)>, <0, (10, 4, 16)>, <0, (10, 6, 4)>, <0, (10, 6, 16)>, <0, (10, 16, 4)>, <0, (10, 16, 6)>, <2, (8, 1, 19)>, <2, (8, 15, 13)>, <2, (8, 15, 19)>, <2, (8, 15, 2)>, <2, (15, 13, 19)>, <2, (15, 13, 2)>, <2, (15, 19, 2)>, <2, (16, 0, 18)>, <2, (16, 0, 19)>, <2, (16, 1, 18)>, <2, (16, 1, 19)>, <2, (16, 18, 0)>, <2, (16, 18, 1)>, <4, (10, 0, 6)>, <4, (10, 0, 16)>, <5, (9, 13, 17)>, <12, (7, 11, 17)>, <12, (7, 11, 0)>, <12, (7, 17, 11)>, <12, (7, 17, 13)>, <12, (7, 17, 12)>, <12, (7, 11, 12)>, <12, (11, 0, 17)>, <12, (11, 7, 17)>, <12, (11, 17, 7)>, <12, (11, 17, 12)>, <12, (11, 7, 12)>, <13, (9, 17, 15)>, <15, (2, 13, 19)>, <16, (0, 1, 18)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [41].
