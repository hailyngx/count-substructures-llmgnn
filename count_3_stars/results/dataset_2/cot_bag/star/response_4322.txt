Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 5, node 6, node 9, node 7, and node 0 have 5 neighbors each. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, and nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 have less than 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of the nodes with 5 neighbors:
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Since all these nodes have the same number of neighbors and form the same number of 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \).

The total number of 3-stars formed by the graph is 50.

Therefore, the final answer is [50].
