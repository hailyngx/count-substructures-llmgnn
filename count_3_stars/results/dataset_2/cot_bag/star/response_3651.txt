Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes and 60 edges provided in the graph. Let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
(0, 8), (0, 10)
(1, 12)
(2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 19)
(3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 18), (3, 19)
(4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 16)
(5, 2), (5, 13), (5, 15)
(6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 14)
(7, 11), (7, 14)
(8, 0), (8, 10), (8, 13), (8, 16)
(9, 6), (9, 10), (9, 16)
(10, 0), (10, 4), (10, 8)
(11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 6), (11, 7), (11, 17)
(12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 16)
(13, 5), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 18)
(14, 4), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 18)
(15, 5)
(16, 4), (16, 8), (16, 12)
(17, 11)
(18, 3), (18, 13), (18, 14)
(19, 2), (19, 3)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, Node 1 has 1 neighbor, Node 9 has 3 neighbors, Node 12 has 4 neighbors, Node 13 has 4 neighbors, Node 16 has 3 neighbors, and Node 18 has 3 neighbors.

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we find:

\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<9, (6, 11, 14)>
<12, (1, 3, 13)>
<13, (5, 8, 18)>
<16, (4, 8, 12)>
<18, (3, 13, 14)>
