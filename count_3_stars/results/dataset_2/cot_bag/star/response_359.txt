Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 1: Can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: Can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: Can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: Can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: Can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 75

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [75].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
