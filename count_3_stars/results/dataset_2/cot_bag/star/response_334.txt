Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 10, 13, and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
5. Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
6. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
7. Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 88

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [88].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 6, 12)>, <9, (5, 6, 10)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 11, 13)>, <10, (9, 6, 12)>, <13, (1, 11, 8)>, <7, (6, 3, 11)>
