Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has neighbors 7, 9, 13, 0, and 6.
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 19, and 17.
- Node 9 has neighbors 15, 4, 10, and 1.
- Node 13 has neighbors 3, 4, 18, and 2.
- Node 15 has neighbors 3, 9, and 12.
- Node 16 has neighbors 10, 8, and 18.
- Node 18 has neighbors 11, 16, and 13.
- Node 19 has neighbors 7 and 5.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 22 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (4, 17, 19)>
<9, (1, 4, 10)>
<13, (2, 4, 18)>
