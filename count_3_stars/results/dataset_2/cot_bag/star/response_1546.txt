Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 13, 14.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 11, 13, 14.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 13.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 14.
    - Total number of 3-stars: 1
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 10.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 11, 12, 13.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 2, 10, 12, 13.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 10, 11.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 13 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 14.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
12. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9.
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
\( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 75 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 75 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we have [75].
