Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 9: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 4: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
Node 8: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 5: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 0: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
Node 2: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
Node 3: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
Node 1: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

Summing these up: $ 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 51 $

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<8, (6, 4, 3)>
<5, (4, 1, 0)>
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<2, (4, 0, 3)>
<3, (9, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 5)>
