Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

1: 17  
2: 4, 6, 10, 16  
3: 4, 7, 14  
5: 7, 18, 19  
8: 9, 11, 13, 15  
12: 6, 9, 16, 19  

1. Node 2 can form 1 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 16)>  
2. Node 3 can form 1 3-star: <3, (4, 7, 14)>  
3. Node 5 can form 1 3-star: <5, (7, 18, 19)>  
4. Node 8 can form 1 3-star: <8, (9, 11, 13)>  
5. Node 12 can form 1 3-star: <12, (6, 9, 16)>  

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
