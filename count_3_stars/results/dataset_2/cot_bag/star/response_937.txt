Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 11) (2, 18) (2, 26) (13, 18) (13, 26) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 20) (26, 0) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 7) (10, 3) (10, 29) (16, 28) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 14) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 24) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 19) (21, 17) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 23) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 14) (14, 28) (14, 9) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 21) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 24) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors, namely nodes: 15, 27, 18, 8, 5, 22, 12, 28, 26, 1, 3, 19, 11, 25, 17, 24, and 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 15 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 27 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 18 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 8 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 22 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 12 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 28 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 26 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 1 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 3 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 19 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
13. Node 11 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
14. Node 25 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
15. Node 17 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
16. Node 24 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
17. Node 29 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 45 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
