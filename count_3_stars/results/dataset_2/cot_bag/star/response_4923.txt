Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 1) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 29) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 3) (1, 17) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 5) (26, 27) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (5, 1) (5, 26) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 29) (28, 27) (28, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 25) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 23) (21, 15) (21, 26) (21, 9) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 22) (14, 8) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 8) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 28) (24, 8) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 25) (25, 1) (25, 12) (25, 19) (25, 23) (23, 15) (23, 13) (23, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 3) (29, 18) (29, 11) (29, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 21) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with their number of neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 1 neighbor
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 10: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 12: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 13: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 15: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 16: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 21: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 22: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 23: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 25: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 26: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 27: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 29: C(3, 3) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [48] \]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 48.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 15, 20>, <1, 17, 26>, <1, 5, 26>, <1, 25, 26>, <2, 18, 12>, <2, 18, 29>, <2, 19, 25>, <2, 19, 29>, <4, 7, 13>, <8, 14, 16>, <8, 16, 24>, <9, 11, 21>, <9, 13, 23>, <10, 17, 1>, <10, 17, 1>, <12, 18, 25>, <21, 22, 27>
