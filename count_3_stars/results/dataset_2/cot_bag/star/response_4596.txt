Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 22, 20, 11, 19
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 17, 14, 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 27, 21, 13
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 26, 15, 6
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 23, 24, 18
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 26, 23, 24, 4
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 19, 14, 2
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 24, 14
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 26, 28, 27
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 0, 15, 25
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 27, 1, 7, 8
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 10, 4, 11
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 21, 1, 2
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 22, 0, 20, 7
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 28, 3, 17
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 23, 19, 0
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors: 22, 5, 18, 29, 6
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors: 12, 29, 6, 8, 5
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 9, 6, 4
- Node 27 has 6 neighbors: 9, 12, 14, 16, 3, 27
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 9, 21, 13
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 23, 25, 24

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 1: [1] = 1
- Node 3: [1] = 1
- Node 4: [1] = 1
- Node 5: [1] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 7: [1] = 1
- Node 8: [1] = 1
- Node 9: [1] = 1
- Node 11: [1] = 1
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 15: [1] = 1
- Node 17: [1] = 1
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 21: [1] = 1
- Node 22: [1] = 1
- Node 23: [inom{5}{3} ] = 10
- Node 24: [inom{5}{3} ] = 10
- Node 26: [1] = 1
- Node 27: [inom{6}{3} ] = 20
- Node 28: [1] = 1
- Node 29: [1] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 60
