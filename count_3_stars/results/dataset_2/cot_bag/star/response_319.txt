Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 7, 1, and 2. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

So, the answer is [28].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 9, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 3)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
