Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (19, 9) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
Node 0: 7, 1, 13
Node 1: 6, 10, 0, 2
Node 2: 17, 6, 18, 12
Node 3: 10, 4
Node 4: 12, 16, 3
Node 5: 11, 7, 8
Node 6: 9, 1, 2, 12
Node 7: 0, 5
Node 8: 10, 11, 5
Node 9: 6, 15, 16, 19
Node 10: 11, 3, 8, 1
Node 11: 19, 5, 8, 10
Node 12: 6, 2, 4
Node 13: 17, 0, 15
Node 15: 17, 9, 13
Node 16: 9, 18, 4
Node 17: 14, 13, 2, 15
Node 18: 2, 16
Node 19: 9, 11

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 12, and 17: <2, (6, 12, 17)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 9, and 12: <6, (1, 9, 12)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 15, and 16: <9, (6, 15, 16)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 11, and 3: <10, (1, 11, 3)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 8, and 19: <11, (5, 8, 19)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 15, and 17: <13, (0, 15, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars = 6. So, the final answer is [6].
