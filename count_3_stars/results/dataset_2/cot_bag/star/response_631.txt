Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 12) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 19) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {16, 10, 17}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 13, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 10, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 15}
- Node 4: {15, 8, 13}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 19, 12}
- Node 7: {17, 18, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 2}
- Node 11: {16, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 1, 14, 18, 6}
- Node 13: {5, 4, 1}
- Node 14: {18, 12}
- Node 15: {3, 4}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 0, 7}
- Node 18: {9, 14, 7, 12}
- Node 19: {16, 7, 2, 6}

Now, we look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 (4 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 (4 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 (5 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17 (3 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18 (4 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 (4 neighbors) contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the contributions from each node: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32]. 

Unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (16, 10, 17)>
- <1, (5, 17, 13)>
- <1, (5, 13, 3)>
- <1, (13, 1, 12)>
- <2, (11, 10, 19)>
- <4, (15, 8, 13)>
- <5, (13, 1, 3)>
- <6, (8, 19, 12)>
- <8, (4, 13, 1)>
- <12, (1, 14, 18)>
- <13, (5, 1, 4)>
- <16, (11, 0, 19)>
- <17, (1, 0, 7)>
- <18, (12, 14, 6)>
- <19, (16, 7, 2)>
- <19, (16, 7, 6)>
