Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. We can then calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 10, 2, 6 (Total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 6, 4, 5, 9 (Total: 5 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 6, 9, 11, 14 (Total: 5 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 10, 2, 8, 13 (Total: 5 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 12, 14, 13 (Total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 12, 5, 14 (Total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 11, 12, 14, 4 (Total: 5 neighbors)
- Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 9, 14, 4 (Total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 7, 2, 8, 13, 9 (Total: 5 neighbors)
- Node 14 has neighbors: 11, 7, 8, 9, 4 (Total: 5 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 51 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 10)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 12)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 9, 14)>
- <5, (3, 8, 13)>
- <5, (8, 12, 13)>
- <9, (3, 4, 11)>
- <9, (4, 11, 14)>
- <12, (7, 8, 13)>
- <14, (7, 8, 9)>
