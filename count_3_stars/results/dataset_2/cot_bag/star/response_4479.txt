Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

So, the final answer is [58].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 4)>
- <2, (1, 8, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 9, 8)>
- <7, (1, 9, 4)>
- <7, (3, 9, 8)>
- <7, (3, 9, 4)>
- <8, (9, 3, 7)>
- <8, (9, 3, 4)>
- <9, (7, 3, 4)>
