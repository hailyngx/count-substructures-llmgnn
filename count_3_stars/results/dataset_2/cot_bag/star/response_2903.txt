This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (3, 23) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 24) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 24) (9, 3) (9, 6) (1, 25) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 29) (22, 0) (22, 24) (22, 25) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 19) (2, 16) (2, 24) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 28) (28, 16) (28, 0) (28, 13) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 29) (27, 29) (27, 20) (10, 12) (17, 4) (17, 26) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 10) (12, 26) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 2) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 20) (29, 21) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 8) (8, 21) (8, 29) (8, 20) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (20, 27) (20, 26) (20, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Edges:
- Node 0: {7, 22, 28}
- Node 1: {25}
- Node 2: {16, 24}
- Node 3: {9, 23}
- Node 4: {7, 17}
- Node 5: {14, 18, 23}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 24}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 24}
- Node 8: {20, 21, 29}
- Node 9: {3, 6}
- Node 10: {12}
- Node 11: {13, 15, 19, 24}
- Node 12: {10, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 13: {11, 18, 28}
- Node 14: {5, 19}
- Node 15: {11, 26}
- Node 16: {2, 12, 28}
- Node 17: {4, 26}
- Node 18: {5, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 19: {11, 14, 23, 29}
- Node 20: {8, 26, 27}
- Node 21: {8, 26, 29}
- Node 22: {0, 24, 25}
- Node 23: {3, 5, 19}
- Node 24: {2, 6, 7, 11, 22}
- Node 25: {1, 22, 29}
- Node 26: {12, 15, 17, 20, 21}
- Node 27: {20, 29}
- Node 28: {7, 13, 16}
- Node 29: {8, 19, 21, 25, 27}

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 have 3 or more neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{27}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{28}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{26}{3} = 12856 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12856, which can be represented as [12856].
