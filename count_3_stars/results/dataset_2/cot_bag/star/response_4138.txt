Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 2) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 14, and their connections are as described by the given edges. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 0, 14, and 2. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1. These 3-stars are: 
    - <1, (4, 7, 0)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 14)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 2)>
    - <1, (4, 0, 14)>
    - <1, (4, 0, 2)>
    - <1, (4, 14, 2)>
    - <1, (7, 0, 14)>
    - <1, (7, 0, 2)>
    - <1, (7, 14, 2)>
    - <1, (0, 14, 2)>

2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 9, 3, 12, 1, and 10. Similarly, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2. These 3-stars are:
    - <2, (9, 3, 12)>
    - <2, (9, 3, 1)>
    - <2, (9, 3, 10)>
    - <2, (9, 12, 1)>
    - <2, (9, 12, 10)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 10)>
    - <2, (3, 12, 1)>
    - <2, (3, 12, 10)>
    - <2, (3, 1, 10)>
    - <2, (12, 1, 10)>

3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors which form 10 3-stars as well.

4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors which form 10 3-stars too.

The rest of the nodes have less than 3 neighbors and therefore cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \). So, the final answer is [40].
