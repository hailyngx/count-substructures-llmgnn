Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 6) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 28) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 29) (18, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 8) (2, 9) (2, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 20) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 5) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 27) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 6) (1, 22) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 20) (3, 13) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 3) (28, 5) (17, 11) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 19) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 20) (23, 16) (23, 29) (15, 26) (27, 6) (27, 29) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 23) (29, 27) (29, 24) (24, 8) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 29) (24, 13) (19, 11) (19, 25) (20, 16) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 5) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 55

Putting the final number inside brackets []:
[55]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (16, 20, 28)>
<7, (0, 10, 21)>
<18, (2, 25, 29)>
<21, (6, 10, 29)>
