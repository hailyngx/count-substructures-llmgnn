Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The node degrees in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 5
- Node 12 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 6
- Node 14 has degree 4

We will now determine the 3-stars in this graph. 

For each node with degree 3 or more, we calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 76 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [76].

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
- <2, (0, 3, 14)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 13, 14)>
- <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- <2, (6, 11, 14)>
- <2, (6, 12, 14)>
- <3, (0, 2, 14)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 14)>
- <3, (6, 11, 12)>
- <3, (6, 11, 14)>
- <4, (7, 8, 13)>
- <6, (7, 9, 14)>
- <8, (1, 4, 13)>
- <8, (4, 7, 13)>
- <8, (4, 13, 12)>
- <8, (7, 6, 13)>
- <8, (7, 13, 14)>
- <12, (0, 2, 14)>
- <12, (2, 6, 14)>
- <12, (6, 11, 14)>
- <13, (4, 7, 8)>
- <13, (4, 8, 1)>
- <13, (7, 6, 8)>
- <13, (7, 8, 14)>
