Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 10.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 11.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives:
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 76 \)

So, the final count of 3-stars is [76].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 10)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 10)>, <1, (4, 7, 10)>, <1, (4, 10, 11)>, <1, (7, 10, 11)>, <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (8, 10, 14)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>, <3, (2, 4, 10)>, <3, (4, 7, 10)>, <3, (10, 14, 11)>, <4, (2, 7, 10)>, <4, (2, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 10, 12)>, <5, (0, 13, 4)>, <5, (0, 13, 11)>, <5, (0, 13, 12)>, <5, (4, 7, 12)>, <5, (5, 11, 13)>, <5, (5, 11, 4)>, <5, (5, 12, 13)>, <5, (7, 12, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 12)>, <6, (6, 7, 12)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 76, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
