Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 7) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The graph with the provided nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 14), (0, 12), (1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 0), (1, 12), (2, 6), (2, 10), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 11), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 14), (8, 10), (8, 12), (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 12), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 13), (7, 11), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 11), (9, 0), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 14), (10, 2), (11, 9), (11, 1), (11, 4), (11, 13), (11, 7), (12, 6), (12, 1), (12, 8), (12, 0), (12, 14), (13, 5), (13, 3), (13, 11), (13, 7), (14, 1), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 12), (14, 10)

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Total number of 3-stars = [7]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 1, 14)>
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<4, (3, 8, 10)>
<7, (6, 11, 13)>
<8, (9, 4, 10)>
<11, (9, 1, 13)>
<12, (6, 1, 14)>
