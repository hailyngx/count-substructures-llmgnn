Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

1: {4, 3}
2: {5, 7, 1, 6}
3: {1, 6, 8}
4: {9, 8, 0, 1, 6}
5: {9, 6, 2, 7}
6: {5, 4, 7, 3, 2}
7: {5, 9, 6, 2, 8}
8: {4, 7, 3, 0}
9: {5, 4, 7, 0}

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For node 1, there are only 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
For node 2, it has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4c3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 3, it has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For node 4, it has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5c3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 5, it has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4c3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 6, it has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5c3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 7, it has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5c3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 8, it has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4c3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 9, it has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4c3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
