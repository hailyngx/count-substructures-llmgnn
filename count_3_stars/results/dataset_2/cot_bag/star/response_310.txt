Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 16) (1, 7) (1, 12) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {4, 11, 2}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {9, 13, 6, 12}
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 13, 2, 15}
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {10, 0, 12, 17}
Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {10, 11, 1, 15, 3}
Node 14 has 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 18}
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {11, 6, 19, 15}
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: {4, 17, 6}

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we get:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
