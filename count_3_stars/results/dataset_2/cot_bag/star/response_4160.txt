Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 12) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (1, 10) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each such node forms.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 3, 15, 0, 10, 19, 6, 14, 5, 12, 2, 18, 7, and 4.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of [30] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<11, 5, 15>
<16, 3, 4>
<3, 15, 19>
<0, 9, 10>
<6, 0, 19>
<14, 13, 4>
<5, 12, 18>
<12, 5, 19>
<2, 13, 7>
<7, 17, 18>
<4, 15, 16>
