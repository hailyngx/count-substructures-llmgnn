Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 7) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 19) (18, 8) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 13) (8, 16) (8, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 4) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 4) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 14, 17
- Node 1: 0, 4, 10
- Node 2: 9, 13
- Node 3: 4, 12, 13
- Node 4: 1, 3, 17
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 12, 13
- Node 7: 0, 5, 15
- Node 8: 16, 18
- Node 9: 2, 5, 13, 17
- Node 10: 1, 11, 16
- Node 11: 10, 12, 14, 16, 17
- Node 12: 3, 6, 11
- Node 13: 2, 3, 6, 9, 19
- Node 14: 0, 11
- Node 15: 7
- Node 16: 8, 10, 11, 19
- Node 17: 0, 4, 9, 11
- Node 18: 8, 19
- Node 19: 8, 13, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors which have the potential to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:
\[ [ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{19}{3} ] = [ \text{Total number of 3-stars} ] \]

\[ [ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{9}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{13}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{19}{3} ] = [ 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 84 + 120 + 165 + 286 + 560 + 680 + 969 ] = [ 2904 ] \]

Therefore, there are 2904 3-stars in the given graph. Let's now list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 4, 17)>
- <0, (7, 5, 17)>
- <0, (14, 11, 1)>
- <0, (17, 11, 4)>
- <0, (17, 13, 4)>
- <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- <1, (10, 16, 11)>
- <3, (4, 12, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 17)>
- <7, (0, 5, 17)>
- <9, (2, 13, 6)>
- <9, (5, 7, 17)>
- <9, (13, 19, 2)>
- <10, (1, 11, 16)>
- <11, (10, 16, 1)>
- <11, (12, 3, 4)>
- <13, (9, 2, 19)>
- <13, (3, 6, 12)>
- <16, (8, 18, 19)>
- <17, (0, 7, 5)>
