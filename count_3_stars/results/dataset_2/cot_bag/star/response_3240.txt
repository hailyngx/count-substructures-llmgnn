Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 13, 3, 11, 12, 1, 0, 10, and 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 99 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final number to put inside brackets is [99].
