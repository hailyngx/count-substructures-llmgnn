Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 6, 9, 1, 8, 4, and 7.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 68 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

List of unique 3-stars:
<6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (6, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 1)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 0, 8)>.
