Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 44 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (9, 0, 3)>
<4, (9, 0, 5)>
<4, (9, 3, 1)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (9, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 0, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<3, (7, 1, 9)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
