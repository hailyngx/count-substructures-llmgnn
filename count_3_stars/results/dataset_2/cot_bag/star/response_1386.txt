Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (18, 16) (18, 17) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (19, 7) (19, 0) (9, 0) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the above information:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47 \]

Therefore, there are 47 unique 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 14, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 19)>, <0, (1, 14, 10)>, <0, (5, 12, 4)>, 
<2, (7, 19, 0)>, <2, (8, 6, 7)>, <2, (8, 7, 19)>, <2, (12, 4, 13)>, <4, (7, 19, 0)>, 
<4, (12, 17, 18)>, <4, (13, 3, 6)>, <4, (13, 1, 1)>, <5, (12, 4, 13)>, <7, (2, 11, 10)>, 
<7, (2, 12, 4)>, <7, (2, 8, 6)>, <12, (2, 8, 6)>, <13, (1, 14, 10)>, <13, (1, 14, 5)>, 
<13, (1, 0, 19)>, <13, (1, 0, 9)>, <13, (4, 7, 19)>, <15, (16, 18, 17)>, <15, (16, 18, 17)>, 
<15, (16, 18, 17)>, <15, (17, 12, 4)>, <17, (12, 4, 13)>, <17, (12, 4, 13)>, <17, (12, 4, 13)>, 
<17, (18, 16, 15)>, <17, (18, 16, 15)>, <17, (18, 16, 15)>, <17, (18, 16, 15)>, <18, (16, 15, 17)>, 
<18, (16, 15, 17)>, <18, (16, 15, 17)>
