Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 7) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

Let's calculate this for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].
