Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are two nodes with less than 3 neighbors in the graph: node 15 and node 16, and hence they do not form any 3-stars. Let's analyze the remaining nodes to see how many 3-stars are formed:

For node 0: (0, 9, 12), (0, 7, 5) -- Total: 2
For node 1: (1, 6, 12), (1, 11, 5), (1, 8, 3) -- Total: 3
For node 2: (2, 4, 0), (2, 5, 7) -- Total: 2
For node 3: (3, 8, 5), (3, 13, 4), (3, 12, 0) -- Total: 3
For node 4: (4, 10, 13), (4, 3, 12), (4, 2, 5) -- Total: 3
For node 5: (5, 8, 3), (5, 7, 1), (5, 2, 7) -- Total: 3
For node 6: (6, 1, 12), (6, 14, 13), (6, 12, 0) -- Total: 3
For node 7: (7, 9, 0), (7, 10, 5), (7, 0, 12) -- Total: 3
For node 8: (8, 5, 3), (8, 1, 12), (8, 3, 13) -- Total: 3
For node 9: (9, 11, 14), (9, 7, 0), (9, 12, 6) -- Total: 3
For node 10: (10, 11, 14), (10, 7, 5), (10, 4, 13) -- Total: 3
For node 11: (11, 9, 14), (11, 1, 5), (11, 10, 4) -- Total: 3
For node 12: (12, 0, 3), (12, 6, 1), (12, 13, 4) -- Total: 3
For node 13: (13, 3, 12), (13, 4, 10), (13, 6, 14) -- Total: 3
For node 14: (14, 6, 13), (14, 9, 11), (14, 10, 11) -- Total: 3

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get: 42. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 9, 12>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 6, 12>, <1, 11, 5>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 4, 0>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 13, 4>, <3, 12, 0>, <4, 10, 13>, <4, 3, 12>, <4, 2, 5>, <5, 8, 3>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 1, 12>, <6, 14, 13>, <6, 12, 0>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 10, 5>, <7, 0, 12>, <8, 5, 3>, <8, 1, 12>, <8, 3, 13>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 7, 0>, <9, 12, 6>, <10, 11, 14>, <10, 7, 5>, <10, 4, 13>, <11, 9, 14>, <11, 1, 5>, <11, 10, 4>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 6, 1>, <12, 13, 4>, <13, 3, 12>, <13, 4, 10>, <13, 6, 14>, <14, 6, 13>, <14, 9, 11>, <14, 10, 11>.
