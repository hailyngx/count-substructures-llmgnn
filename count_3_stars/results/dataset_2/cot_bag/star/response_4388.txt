Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, one 3-star is formed with the node itself as the central node.

Calculating for the eligible nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Nodes 5, 9, 1, 10, 11, 7, 12, 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

So, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 10, 3)>
<4, (9, 4, 13)>
<8, (1, 8, 14)>
<5, (9, 5, 14)>
<9, (10, 9, 1)>
<1, (10, 1, 3)>
<10, (11, 10, 2)>
<11, (5, 11, 0)>
<7, (11, 7, 14)>
<12, (2, 12, 13)>
<13, (4, 13, 7)>
<5, (7, 5, 11)>
<5, (7, 5, 14)>
<11, (7, 11, 14)>
<12, (7, 12, 13)>
<5, (9, 5, 7)>
<11, (9, 11, 5)>
