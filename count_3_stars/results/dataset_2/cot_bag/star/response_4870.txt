Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's summarize the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54 \]

So, there are a total of 54 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (7, 8, 2)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>,
<2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>, <7, (0, 8, 3)>, 
<7, (8, 6, 3)>, <7, (8, 6, 1)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 2)>, 
<8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>.
