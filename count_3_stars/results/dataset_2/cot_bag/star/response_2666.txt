Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8. 

For node 1:
The neighbors of node 1 are {5, 9, 4, 3, 2}. 
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars that can be formed using node 1. 
Unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>

For node 3:
The neighbors of node 3 are {7, 6, 1, 0, 8}.
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars that can be formed using node 3.
Unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
<3, (7, 6, 1)>
<3, (7, 6, 0)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>

For node 4:
The neighbors of node 4 are {9, 8, 1, 6}.
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed using node 4.
Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>

For node 8:
The neighbors of node 8 are {5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0}.
There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars that can be formed using node 8.
Unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<8, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<8, (5, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
<8, (5, 2, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (4, 3, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<8, (7, 3, 2)>
<8, (7, 3, 0)>
<8, (7, 2, 0)>
<8, (3, 2, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44 \)
So, the final number of 3-stars: [44]
