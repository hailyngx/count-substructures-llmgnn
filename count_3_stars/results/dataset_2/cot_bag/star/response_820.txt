Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's draw the graph with the given information:
          
                    9----8----7----5
                    |         |     
                    3----6----1
                     \___|
                     |  0
                     4---2
​
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, and 9.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 7.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
