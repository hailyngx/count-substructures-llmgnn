Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 8) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (8, 15) (8, 9) (13, 17) (13, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 14) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges:
- 0: {4, 5, 10}
- 1: {4, 6}
- 2: {5, 14, 17}
- 3: {7, 18, 19}
- 4: {0, 5, 6, 14, 18}
- 5: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- 6: {1, 4, 7}
- 7: {3, 6, 10, 12}
- 8: {9, 15}
- 9: {5, 8, 12, 15}
- 10: {0, 7, 14, 16}
- 11: {13, 17}
- 12: {7, 9}
- 13: {11, 17}
- 14: {0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 16}
- 15: {8, 9}
- 16: {10, 14, 18}
- 17: {2, 11, 13}
- 18: {3, 4, 16}
- 19: {3}

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 44

So, there are 44 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 10)>
<9, (5, 8, 12)>
<10, (0, 14, 16)>
<14, (1, 10, 16)> 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
