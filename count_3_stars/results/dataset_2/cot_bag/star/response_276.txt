Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 18) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (17, 15) (17, 12) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 44, and we represent them as follows:
\[ [44] \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (15, 1, 18)>
<4, (7, 4, 18)>
<5, (2, 5, 19)>
<7, (4, 7, 18)>
<8, (16, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<10, (0, 10, 15)>
<12, (2, 12, 13)>
<15, (0, 15, 17)>
<16, (1, 8, 16)>
<18, (6, 7, 18)>
<19, (5, 10, 19)>
