Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 25) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 19) (3, 28) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 23) (13, 11) (13, 4) (22, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 19) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 15) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 6) (24, 9) (24, 26) (10, 27) (10, 7) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 23) (28, 3) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 23) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 21) (23, 25) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 4) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 11 (neighbors: 16, 13, 6, 20, 25)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 0, 25)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 9, 14, 27, 21, 29)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 1, 27, 26, 4, 6)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 11, 25, 8, 22)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 17, 12, 8, 23)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 1, 19, 24, 15)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 14, 17, 10, 19)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 17, 4, 18)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 16, 15, 23)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 11, 14, 19, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 9, 10, 6, 18)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 13, 29, 19, 23)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 25, 0, 21, 4)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 29, 15, 28, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59

So, there are a total of 59 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [59].
