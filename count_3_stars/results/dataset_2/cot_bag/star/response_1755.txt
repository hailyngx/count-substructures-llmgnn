Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
