Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 22) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 9) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 24) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 16) (9, 2) (18, 20) (18, 3) (22, 1) (22, 4) (22, 17) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 3) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 23) (26, 2) (26, 6) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 18) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 24) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 25) (23, 19) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 8) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 6) (24, 28) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 25) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 19) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 10) (13, 25) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 13) (19, 23) (19, 14) 

Response:
We'll first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 14), (1, 22), (1, 7) - forms 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 29), (2, 26), (2, 9), (2, 20) - forms 1 3-star
Node 12: (12, 21), (12, 0), (12, 27), (12, 28), (12, 3) - forms 1 3-star
Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 6), (14, 4), (14, 19) - forms 1 3-star
Node 15: (15, 8), (15, 17), (15, 10) - forms 1 3-star
Node 17: (17, 22), (17, 23), (17, 15), (17, 29) - forms 1 3-star
Node 20: (20, 21), (20, 29), (20, 18), (20, 2) - forms 1 3-star
Node 24: (24, 29), (24, 10), (24, 6), (24, 28) - forms 1 3-star
Node 27: (27, 0), (27, 12), (27, 16) - forms 1 3-star
Node 29: (29, 2), (29, 17), (29, 20), (29, 24) - forms 1 3-star

So, there are 9 3-stars in total. 

Putting this count inside brackets, we get [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (14, 7, 22)>
<2, (20, 9, 26)>
<12, (27, 0, 3)>
<14, (11, 4, 6)>
<15, (8, 17, 10)>
<17, (22, 23, 29)>
<20, (21, 18, 2)>
<24, (29, 10, 6)>
<27, (12, 0, 16)>
  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
