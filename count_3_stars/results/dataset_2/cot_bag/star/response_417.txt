Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with more than two neighbors are: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (6, 7, 17)>
<4, (6, 8, 17)>
<6, (3, 4, 11)>
<7, (3, 9, 18)>
<8, (4, 15, 17)>
<10, (6, 16, 17)>
<12, (5, 11, 18)>
<13, (0, 14, 15)>
<15, (8, 13, 19)>
<16, (2, 3, 10)>
<17, (10, 12, 4)>
<19, (0, 14, 15)>
