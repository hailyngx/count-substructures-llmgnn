Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 1) (15, 1) (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 23) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 0) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 19) (17, 26) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 20) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 6) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (28, 12) (25, 16) (25, 10) (25, 17) (25, 18) (27, 19) (27, 8) (26, 22) (26, 11) (26, 29) (26, 17) (9, 22) (9, 8) (8, 27) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 5) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (23, 13) (23, 4) (6, 20) (14, 2) (12, 28) (12, 8) (21, 22) (21, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 25) (18, 5) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 27) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 62 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 7, 15)>, <4, (7, 11, 23)>, <8, (5, 9, 21)>, <10, (0, 19, 25)>, <11, (16, 24, 26)>, <16, (11, 18, 29)>, <18, (10, 16, 25)>, <20, (0, 2, 6)>, <22, (9, 13, 26)>, <26, (17, 22, 29)>.
