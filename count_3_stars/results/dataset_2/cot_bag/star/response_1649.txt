Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (9, 3) (9, 10) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 12) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 

Node 0, degree 4  
Node 2, degree 4  
Node 3, degree 4  
Node 4, degree 4  
Node 6, degree 4  
Node 8, degree 3  
Node 10, degree 3  
Node 11, degree 4  
Node 12, degree 3  
Node 13, degree 4  
Node 15, degree 3  
Node 16, degree 3  
Node 17, degree 4  
Node 19, degree 3  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32 \]

So, there are 32 total 3-stars in this graph (<1, (4, 0, 5)>, <2, (8, 16, 7)>, <3, (17, 11, 6)>, <4, (12, 15, 0)>, <5, (0, 3, 17)>, <6, (13, 10, 17)>, <8, (16, 2, 15)>, <10, (1, 9, 13)>, <11, (17, 2, 18)>, <12, (4, 15, 11)>, <13, (6, 19, 10)>, <15, (12, 4, 8)>, <16, (7, 2, 8)>, <17, (11, 3, 6)>, <19, (2, 13, 1)>)
