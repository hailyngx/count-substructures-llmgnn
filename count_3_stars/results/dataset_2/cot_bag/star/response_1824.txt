Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are provided in the given list.  
Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions from all nodes, we get 
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

For the unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 8, 4)>, <2, (1, 8, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (8, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>
