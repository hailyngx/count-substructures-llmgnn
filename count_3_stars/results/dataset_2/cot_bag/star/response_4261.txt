Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 72

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [72].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 13)>
<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<9, (0, 10, 14)>
<11, (0, 12, 14)>
