Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
This graph is a bit intricate, so let's first find the nodes with three or more neighbors and then count the 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 8, 13, 4, 18, 0, 16, 7, 10, 6, 11, 19, 1, 14, 3, 15, 9, 5, 17.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

1. Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
2. Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
3. Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
4. Node 18: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
5. Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
6. Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
7. Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
8. Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
9. Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
10. Node 11: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
11. Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
12. Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
13. Node 14: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
14. Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
15. Node 15: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
16. Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
17. Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
18. Node 17: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <8, (13, 5, 1)>, <13, (8, 10, 18)>, <4, (11, 6, 2)>, <18, (10, 7, 3)>, <0, (16, 17, 9)>, <16, (0, 7, 15)>, <7, (8, 18, 16)>, <10, (13, 18, 19)>, <6, (4, 2, 1)>, <11, (4, 19, 5)>, <19, (10, 12, 11)>, <1, (8, 6, 14)>, <14, (12, 1, 3)>, <3, (18, 16, 14)>, <15, (16, 12, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 15)>, <5, (8, 1, 11)>.
