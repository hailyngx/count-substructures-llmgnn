Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented as follows:
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\} \]

Given the information provided, we can see that the nodes and their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 11, 5, 4, 2
- Node 1: 15, 11, 12
- Node 2: 16, 7, 0
- Node 3: 10, 16, 19
- Node 4: 18, 0, 14, 15
- Node 5: 13, 8, 17, 0
- Node 6: 9, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 6, 5
- Node 9: 6, 19, 12
- Node 10: 3, 11, 12, 14
- Node 11: 1, 10, 14, 0
- Node 12: 9, 1, 10
- Node 13: 5, 17
- Node 14: 10, 11, 4, 19
- Node 15: 1, 4
- Node 16: 3, 18, 2, 17
- Node 17: 5, 13, 16
- Node 18: 4, 16
- Node 19: 9, 3, 14

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<0, (11, 5, 4)>, <0, (11, 5, 2)>, <0, (11, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>

For Node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<1, (15, 11, 12)>

For Node 3:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<3, (10, 16, 19)>

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<4, (18, 16, 2)>, <4, (18, 16, 17)>, <4, (16, 2, 17)>, <4, (18, 2, 17)>

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<5, (13, 17, 16)>, <5, (13, 17, 4)>, <5, (13, 16, 4)>, <5, (17, 16, 4)>

For Node 10:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<10, (11, 14, 19)>, <10, (11, 14, 4)>, <10, (11, 19, 4)>, <10, (14, 19, 4)>

For Node 11:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<11, (10, 14, 19)>, <11, (10, 14, 4)>, <11, (10, 19, 4)>, <11, (14, 19, 4)>

For Node 16:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<16, (18, 2, 17)>, <16, (18, 2, 4)>, <16, (18, 17, 4)>, <16, (2, 17, 4)>

For Node 19:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<19, (9, 14, 3)>

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
