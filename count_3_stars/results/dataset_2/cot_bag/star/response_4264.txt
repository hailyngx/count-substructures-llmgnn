Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 24) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 29) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 24) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 13) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 23) (26, 3) (26, 11) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 22) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 23) (10, 5) (21, 14) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 4) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 6) (22, 24) (22, 4) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 25) (9, 18) (9, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 9) (0, 2) (29, 14) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 27) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 29) (11, 6) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 21) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 1
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 1
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 4
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 4
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 2
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 2

From the degrees, we see there are 7 nodes with degree >= 3: 0, 3, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25
Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are [40] 3-stars in this graph.
And the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 17, 26)>
- <13, (20, 23, 29)>
- <14, (17, 21, 29)>
- <15, (0, 24, 28)>
- <24, (0, 15, 22)>
- <25, (16, 23, 27)>
