Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with 6 neighbors
- Node 1 with 5 neighbors
- Node 2 with 4 neighbors
- Node 3 with 2 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 5 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors
- Node 7 with 4 neighbors
- Node 8 with 5 neighbors
- Node 9 with 5 neighbors
- Node 10 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors
- Node 12 with 5 neighbors
- Node 13 with 5 neighbors
- Node 14 with 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 0 3-stars
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node with 4 neighbors, so a total of  \[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \] 3-stars
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node with 5 neighbors, so a total of \[ 9 \times 10 = 90 \] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \[ 0 + 8 + 90 = 98 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ [98] \]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (5, 1, 13)>
- <1, (4, 0, 13)>
- <2, (7, 10, 13)>
- <3, (5, 4, 11)>
- <4, (8, 1, 11)>
- <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- <6, (0, 12, 14)>
- <7, (5, 9, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 10)>
- <9, (8, 5, 12)>
- <10, (8, 0, 2)>
- <11, (4, 8, 13)>
- <12, (9, 7, 6)>
- <13, (12, 1, 2)>
- <14, (9, 2, 6)>
