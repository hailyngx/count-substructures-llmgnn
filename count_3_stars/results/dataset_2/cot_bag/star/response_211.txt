Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 2) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 13) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars: [12].  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 19, 2)>, <1, (10, 11, 17)>, <2, (0, 7, 17)>, <3, (0, 6, 19)>, <4, (8, 14, 5)>, <5, (11, 14, 18)>, <7, (2, 8, 17)>, <9, (0, 5, 19)>, <11, (1, 12, 15)>, <13, (6, 10, 18)>, <14, (2, 4, 19)>, <18, (5, 13, 14)>.
