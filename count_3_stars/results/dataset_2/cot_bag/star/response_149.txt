Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 13, 12, 7, 14, 0, 10, and 11. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 83 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [83]. Some of the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 3, 10)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 14)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<13, (2, 7, 12)>
<12, (6, 1, 13)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>
<14, (8, 7, 13)>
<0, (9, 8, 11)>
<10, (6, 3, 13)>
<11, (8, 0, 12)>
