Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2, 13, 0, 11, 14, and 12.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:

1. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.
2. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node.
3. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the central node.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.
6. Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.
7. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.
8. Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 13 as the central node.
9. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star can be formed with node 0 as the central node.
10. Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 11 as the central node.
11. Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 14 as the central node.
12. Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 12 as the central node.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 83\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [83].

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (7, 1, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 3, 11)>, <3, (1, 9, 2)>, <6, (4, 7, 11)>, <9, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (4, 3, 5)>, <13, (7, 2, 5)>, <0, (13, 11, 12)>, <11, (1, 6, 13)>, <14, (3, 9, 10)>, <12, (9, 8, 0)>.
