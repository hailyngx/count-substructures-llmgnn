Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

For node 0: It has three neighbors (4, 8, 9) so it forms [] = 3 3-stars.
For node 1: It has four neighbors (4, 3, 5, 6) so it forms [] = 4 3-stars.
For node 2: It has three neighbors (7, 8, 9) so it forms [] = 3 3-stars.
For node 3: It has two neighbors (1, 6) so it forms no 3-stars.
For node 4: It has seven neighbors (7, 9, 0, 5, 1, 6) so it forms [] = 7 3-stars.
For node 5: It has four neighbors (4, 1, 8) so it forms [] = 4 3-stars.
For node 6: It has five neighbors (4, 7, 1, 3) so it forms [] = 5 3-stars.
For node 7: It has five neighbors (4, 6, 9, 2, 8) so it forms [] = 5 3-stars.
For node 8: It has four neighbors (7, 2, 5, 0) so it forms [] = 4 3-stars.
For node 9: It has six neighbors (4, 7, 1, 2, 0) so it forms [] = 6 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(3 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 6 = 36\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
