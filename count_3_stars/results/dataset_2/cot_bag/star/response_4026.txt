Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 7
Node 3: 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of 38 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 38 [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (5, 7, 9)>  
<4, (2, 3, 7)>  
<5, (6, 7, 8)>  
<6, (1, 4, 8)>  
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
