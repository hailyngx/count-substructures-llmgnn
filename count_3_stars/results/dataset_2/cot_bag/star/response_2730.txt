Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 8, 6, 2, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9, 0}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 5, 0, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {7, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 0, 2}

Node 4, 7, and 9 meet the condition of having at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 3)>

For Node 7:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>

For Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (7, 1, 0)>, <9, (7, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 0, 2)>, <9, (2, 0, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
