Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as shown below:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 9}
- 1: {4, 7, 3, 6, 9}
- 2: {4, 8, 5, 6, 9}
- 3: {1, 0, 9, 8}
- 4: {7, 0, 1, 2}
- 5: {7, 2, 0}
- 6: {1, 2}
- 7: {4, 0, 5, 1}
- 8: {3, 2, 0}
- 9: {1, 3, 2, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

By summing up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 56 3-stars in the graph ([]).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 1)>
<0, (7, 1, 4)>
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (3, 0, 9)>
