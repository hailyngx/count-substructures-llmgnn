Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 6, 1, 7, 2, and 8.

For node 6: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, all with node 6 as the center. 
For node 1: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, all with node 1 as the center. 
For node 7: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, all with node 7 as the center. 
For node 2: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, all with node 2 as the center. 
For node 8: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, all with node 8 as the center. 

So the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (6, 1, 3)>.
