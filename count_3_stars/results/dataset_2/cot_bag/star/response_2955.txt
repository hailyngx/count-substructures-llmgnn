Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 13) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 15) (12, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 17) (0, 3) (0, 17) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
11. Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
12. Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
13. Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
14. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
16. Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (6, 14, 2)>, <2, (12, 15, 14)>, <4, (5, 10, 11)>, <6, (1, 8, 18)>, <8, (6, 17, 19)>, <9, (13, 15, 18)>, <10, (2, 4, 5)>, <11, (4, 17, 19)>, <12, (2, 15, 18)>, <15, (1, 9, 12)>, <17, (0, 8, 11)>, <18, (6, 9, 17)>, <19, (8, 11, 2)>.
