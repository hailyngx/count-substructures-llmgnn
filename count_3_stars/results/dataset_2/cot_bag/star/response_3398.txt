Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors as follows:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8, 14, 12}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8, 10, 12}
Node 3: Neighbors {1}
Node 4: Neighbors {8, 11, 12, 13, 14}
Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 13, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {5, 12}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 11}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10, 13}
Node 10: Neighbors {2, 6, 9, 11}
Node 11: Neighbors {4, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Node 12: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 11, 13}
Node 13: Neighbors {4, 6, 9, 12}
Node 14: Neighbors {1, 4, 11, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [0 C 3] = 1 3-star
<0, (1, 8, 14)>

Node 1: [6 C 3] = 20 3-stars
<1, (0, 2, 14)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 13)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 10, 11)>, <1, (2, 10, 6)>, <1, (2, 10, 8)>, <1, (2, 12, 11)>, <1, (2, 12, 4)>, <1, (2, 12, 13)>, <1, (4, 11, 12)>, <1, (4, 11, 13)>, <1, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 14)>, <1, (4, 13, 12)>, <1, (4, 13, 9)>, <1, (11, 14, 4)>, <1, (14, 0, 1)>

Node 2: [4 C 3] = 4 3-stars
<2, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <2, (8, 10, 6)>, <2, (12, 4, 13)>

Node 4: [5 C 3] = 10 3-stars
<4, (0, 8, 12)>, <4, (0, 8, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 7)>, <4, (0, 12, 11)>, <4, (0, 12, 13)>, <4, (7, 12, 11)>, <4, (7, 12, 2)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <4, (11, 14, 0)>, <4, (14, 1, 11)>

Node 6: [5 C 3] = 10 3-stars
<6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 1, 10)>, <6, (5, 1, 13)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (10, 2, 8)>, <6, (10, 2, 12)>, <6, (10, 11, 4)>, <6, (10, 11, 14)>, <6, (8, 0, 1)>, <6, (8, 11, 4)>

Node 8: [5 C 3] = 10 3-stars
<8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 11)>, <8, (1, 4, 14)>, <8, (2, 12, 11)>, <8, (2, 12, 13)>, <8, (6, 10, 2)>, <8, (6, 10, 11)>, <8, (6, 10, 13)>, <8, (10, 11, 14)>, <8, (11, 12, 4)>

Node 10: [4 C 3] = 4 3-stars
<10, (1, 6, 2)>, <10, (1, 6, 13)>, <10, (2, 8, 6)>, <10, (6, 8, 11)>

Node 11: [5 C 3] = 10 3-stars
<11, (4, 8, 12)>, <11, (4, 8, 14)>, <11, (4, 12, 7)>, <11, (4, 12, 0)>, <11, (4, 12, 13)>, <11, (7, 12, 0)>, <11, (7, 12, 2)>, <11, (7, 12, 13)>, <11, (12, 14, 0)>, <11, (14, 1, 4)>

Node 12: [6 C 3] = 20 3-stars
<12, (0, 2, 7)>, <12, (0, 2, 11)>, <12, (0, 2, 13)>, <12, (0, 7, 4)>, <12, (0, 11, 13)>, <12, (2, 4, 8)>, <12, (2, 4, 13)>, <12, (2, 8, 6)>, <12, (4, 7, 13)>, <12, (4, 11, 14)>, <12, (7, 4, 13)>, <12, (7, 4, 11)>, <12, (7, 2, 13)>, <12, (7, 2, 11)>, <12, (11, 14, 0)>, <12, (13, 4, 9)>, <12, (13, 7, 2)>, <12, (13, 9, 4)>, <12, (13, 9, 11)>, <12, (13, 11, 4)>

Node 13: [4 C 3] = 4 3-stars
<13, (4, 6, 12)>, <13, (6, 10, 2)>, <13, (6, 10, 11)>, <13, (6, 12, 4)>

From the calculations above, we have a total of [1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = 93 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [93].
