Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, and node 3.

For node 1, it has 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 9, 11, 12), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving node 1 are <1, (5, 9, 11)>, <1, (5, 9, 12)>, <1, (5, 11, 12)>, and <1, (9, 11, 12)>.

For node 2, it has 6 neighbors (nodes 4, 12, 0, 3, 1, 10), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving node 2 are <2, (4, 12, 0)>, <2, (4, 12, 3)>, <2, (4, 12, 1)>, <2, (4, 12, 10)>, <2, (4, 0, 3)>, <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 10)>, <2, (4, 3, 1)>, <2, (4, 3, 10)>, <2, (4, 1, 10)>, <2, (12, 0, 3)>, <2, (12, 0, 1)>, <2, (12, 0, 10)>, <2, (12, 3, 1)>, <2, (12, 3, 10)>, <2, (12, 1, 10)>, <2, (0, 3, 1)>, <2, (0, 3, 10)>, <2, (0, 1, 10)>, <2, (3, 1, 10)>.

For node 3, it has 5 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 11, 2, 10), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 3 are <3, (5, 6, 11)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 10)>, <3, (5, 11, 2)>, <3, (5, 11, 10)>, <3, (5, 2, 10)>, <3, (6, 11, 2)>, <3, (6, 11, 10)>, <3, (6, 2, 10)>, <3, (11, 2, 10)>.

Therefore, there are a total of \( 4 + 20 + 10 = 34 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So the final answer is [34].
