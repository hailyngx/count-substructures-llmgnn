Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can determine the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 0, 8, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6, 9, 2, 5, 4}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 0, 9, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 0, 2, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 0}

By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we find that only Node 1 and Node 3 can form 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
   <1, (3, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 7)>, <1, (5, 8, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 7)>
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <3, (1, 9, 2)>, <3, (1, 9, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 2)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 2, 5)>, <3, (9, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 0)>, <3, (6, 4, 0)>, <3, (4, 0, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 = 30
Thus, the result is: [30]
