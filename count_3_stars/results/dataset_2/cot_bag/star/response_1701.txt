Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 20) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 14) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 4) (8, 19) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 3) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 2) (24, 7) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 1) (15, 28) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (25, 9) (25, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 5) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (12, 16) (12, 23) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 28) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 15) (28, 2) (6, 4) (6, 29) (6, 23) (29, 22) (29, 11) (29, 6) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 2) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 24) (7, 23) (3, 20) (5, 11) (5, 16) (23, 21) (23, 12) (23, 6) (23, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the given formula:
1. For nodes with 3 neighbors: 
   - Nodes: 4 (Node 4), 6 (Node 6), 9 (Node 9), 11 (Node 11), 16 (Node 16), 18 (Node 18), 20 (Node 20), 29 (Node 29)
   - Total 3-stars: 0

2. For nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
   - Nodes: 1 (Node 1), 2 (Node 2), 7 (Node 7), 10 (Node 10), 14 (Node 14), 15 (Node 15), 19 (Node 19), 21 (Node 21), 22 (Node 22), 23 (Node 23), 26 (Node 26), 28 (Node 28)
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \)

Summing up, we get: \( 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 15, 19)>, <2, (1, 14, 22)>, <7, (1, 19, 23)>, <10, (7, 19, 21)>, <14, (1, 19, 25)>, <15, (7, 28, 26)>, <19, (1, 2, 10)>, <21, (10, 22, 23)>, <22, (14, 21, 28)>, <23, (7, 21, 6)>, <26, (1, 15, 20)>, <28, (2, 15, 22)>
