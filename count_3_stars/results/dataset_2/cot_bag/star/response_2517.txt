Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we look for nodes with three or more neighbors. We identify nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as having at least three neighbors each.

The counts of 3-stars formed from each node with three or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4] = [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>

The final answer is [15].
