Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 26) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 6) (22, 18) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 7) (25, 28) (8, 4) (8, 5) (17, 20) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (9, 19) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 6) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 2) (21, 29) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 6) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 29) (28, 25) (28, 3) (28, 0) (2, 21) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 0) (12, 24) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 23) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 27) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 20) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 27) (24, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (29, 21) (29, 26) (29, 15) (10, 20) (10, 23) (27, 9) (27, 11) (27, 6) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 18, 20, 25, 21, 9, 13, 3, 26, 28, 6, 17, 15, 19 and 23.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 23 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 60 3-stars. 
Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [60]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (25, 16, 11)>, <18, (22, 6, 16)>, <20, (17, 6, 10)>, <21, (9, 29, 3)>, <9, (19, 14, 27)>, <6, (13, 27, 14)>, <23, (13, 19, 10)>.
