Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 10}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 5, 9, 13, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 3: [3 + 1]
- Node 4: [1 + 1 + 1]
- Node 5: [1 + 1 + 1]
- Node 7: [3 + 1 + 1]
- Node 8: [3 + 1]
- Node 9: [3 + 1]
- Node 10: [1 + 1 + 1]
- Node 11: [3 + 1 + 1]
- Node 12: [1 + 1 + 1]
- Node 13: [1 + 1 + 1]

Adding these up, we get:
\[ [0] + [1] + [3 + 1] + [1 + 1 + 1] + [1 + 1 + 1] + [3 + 1 + 1] + [3 + 1] + [3 + 1] + [1 + 1 + 1] + [3 + 1 + 1] + [1 + 1 + 1] + [1 + 1 + 1] = 25\]

Therefore, there are a total of 25 three-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 7, 4)>, <3, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (2, 10, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 5)>, <4, (7, 1, 12)>, <4, (12, 8, 11)>, <5, (7, 13, 11)>, <7, (13, 11, 5)>, <7, (13, 11, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 1)>, <8, (3, 11, 12)>, <9, (3, 6, 1)>, <9, (3, 11, 13)>, <10, (2, 4, 14)>,  <10, (3, 14, 10)>, <11, (3, 9, 5)>
