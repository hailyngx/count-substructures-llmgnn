Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 18) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 18) (16, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (11, 0) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 11) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: 1

Total number of 3-stars: [4*9 + 1] = 37

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 11)>
<1, (0, 10, 12)>
<2, (0, 3, 14)>
<3, (9, 13, 17)>
<4, (5, 6, 10)>
<5, (4, 16, 17)>
<10, (1, 4, 18)>
<14, (2, 8, 13)>
<17, (3, 5, 10)>
<18, (7, 10, 19)>
<19, (6, 12, 14)>
