Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

For node 0: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<0, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 1: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<1, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 2: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<2, (3, 4, 7)>

For node 3: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
<3, (0, 1, 8)>

For node 4: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
<4, (6, 9, 2)>

For node 7: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<7, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 8: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 9: 
- Number of 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 57
