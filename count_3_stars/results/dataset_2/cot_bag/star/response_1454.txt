Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node. So, we have \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 4, 5, and 7, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each node. So, we have \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 30 = 50 \), which I'll denote as [50].

Let's now list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
