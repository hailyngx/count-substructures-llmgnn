Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up these numbers, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 4)>
