Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 (3-stars)
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 (3-stars)
- Node 9: As it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
