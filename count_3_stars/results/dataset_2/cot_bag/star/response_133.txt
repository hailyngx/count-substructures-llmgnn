Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
With 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 12, 2, and 4.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 14, and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 8, and 14.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 6, and 13.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 10.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 0, 4, and 13.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 0, 3, and 14.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 13.
10. Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 3, 6, 13, and 14.
11. Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 3, 1, and 6.
12. Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 0, 1, 8.
13. Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 7, 6.
14. Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 2, 0, 3.

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 can form 3 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 can form 6 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 10 can form 6 3-stars since it has 6 neighbors.
- Node 11 can form 5 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 13 can form 2 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 14 can form 2 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (5, 11, 4)>, <2, (7, 1, 14)>, <3, (10, 11, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>, <6, (10, 11, 0)>, <6, (10, 13, 6)>, <6, (3, 11, 4)>, <8, (7, 12, 0)>, <8, (7, 8, 0)>, <8, (2, 7, 14)>, <8, (7, 13, 0)>, <8, (2, 1, 14)>, <8, (2, 14, 0)>, <10, (5, 11, 3)>, <10, (5, 11, 6)>, <10, (11, 13, 7)>, <10, (3, 14, 12)>, <10, (3, 6, 13)>, <10, (14, 2, 0)>, <11, (5, 10, 3)>, <11, (1, 4, 6)>, <11, (1, 6, 13)>, <11, (4, 9, 13)>, <11, (9, 13, 7)>, <12, (14, 0, 8)>, <13, (9, 10, 7)>, <13, (9, 6, 13)>, <14, (10, 12, 0)>, <14, (10, 3, 8)>.
