Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 27) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 21) (25, 3) (25, 10) (25, 8) (28, 9) (28, 8) (29, 9) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 20) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 16) (21, 11) (21, 6) (23, 5) (23, 11) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 2) (12, 24) (22, 4) (22, 14) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 22) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 18) (14, 22) (14, 20) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 16) (20, 14) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
There are certain nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which could potentially form 3-stars. Let's identify those nodes:

1. Node 2: Connected to 4 other nodes (5, 7, 15, 12)
2. Node 3: Connected to 4 other nodes (1, 25, 27, 13)
3. Node 5: Connected to 4 other nodes (9, 26, 2, 23)
4. Node 8: Connected to 4 other nodes (25, 28, 20, 16)
5. Node 9: Connected to 5 other nodes (5, 29, 0, 28, 27)
6. Node 10: Connected to 3 other nodes (1, 11, 25)
7. Node 11: Connected to 3 other nodes (10, 23, 21)
8. Node 12: Connected to 3 other nodes (2, 26, 24)
9. Node 13: Connected to 5 other nodes (3, 16, 24, 18, 27)
10. Node 15: Connected to 3 other nodes (1, 26, 2)
11. Node 16: Connected to 5 other nodes (6, 8, 24, 13, 20)
12. Node 20: Connected to 5 other nodes (7, 26, 8, 16, 14)
13. Node 24: Connected to 4 other nodes (12, 16, 13, 18)
14. Node 26: Connected to 4 other nodes (5, 15, 20, 12)
15. Node 27: Connected to 5 other nodes (9, 3, 6, 18, 13)
16. Node 28: Connected to 2 other nodes (9, 8)
17. Node 29: Connected to 1 other node (9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (9, 2, 23)>
    - <5, (9, 2, 26)>
    - <5, (9, 2, 5)>
    - <5, (9, 23, 5)>
2. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <9, (5, 0, 28)>
    - <9, (5, 0, 27)>
    - <9, (5, 0, 9)>
    - <9, (5, 28, 9)>
    - <9, (5, 27, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 27, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 28, 9)>
    - <9, (27, 28, 9)>
    - <9, (5, 27, 3)>
    - <9, (5, 9, 29)>
3. Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <13, (16, 18, 27)>
    - <13, (18, 24, 27)>
    - <13, (16, 18, 24)>
    - <13, (16, 18, 13)>
    - <13, (16, 24, 27)>
    - <13, (16, 13, 24)>
    - <13, (16, 13, 27)>
    - <13, (18, 24, 13)>
    - <13, (18, 24, 18)>
    - <13, (18, 24, 27)>
4. Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <16, (6, 20, 24)>
    - <16, (6, 16, 24)>
    - <16, (6, 20, 16)>
    - <16, (6, 13, 16)>
    - <16, (6, 13, 24)>
    - <16, (20, 8, 24)>
    - <16, (20, 14, 16)>
    - <16, (20, 14, 24)>
    - <16, (8, 14, 20)>
    - <16, (8, 13, 16)>
5. Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <20, (7, 8, 16)>
    - <20, (7, 14, 20)>
    - <20, (7, 8, 20)>
    - <20, (7, 14, 16)>
    - <20, (7, 20, 26)>
    - <20, (7, 20, 14)>
    - <20, (8, 14, 20)>
    - <20, (26, 14, 20)>
    - <20, (26, 8, 20)>
    - <20, (26, 8, 16)>
6. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <26, (15, 12, 2)>
    - <26, (15, 20, 2)>
    - <26, (15, 12, 26)>
    - <26, (15, 12, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48\). So, the final answer is [48].
