Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 17) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (15, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 5) (28, 23) (28, 17) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 12) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 11) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 12) (22, 8) (22, 9) (1, 25) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 7) (10, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (6, 17) (6, 19) (29, 20) (29, 10) (29, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (16, 7) (16, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 29) (12, 24) (24, 23) (24, 12) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 25: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 23: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 18: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 21: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 28: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 13: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 26: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 9: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 22: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 11: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 14: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 19: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 29: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 7: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 24: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 16: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 27: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 0: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 1: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 17: 5 choose 3 = 10

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each eligible node:
4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].
