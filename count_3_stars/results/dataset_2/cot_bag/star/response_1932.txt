Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (1, 2) (3, 19) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 15) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of them forms:

1. Node 4: Node 4 has 5 neighbors (nodes 7, 9, 10, 14, 15).
   Number of 3-stars formed by node 4 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   
2. Node 6: Node 6 has 4 neighbors (nodes 9, 5, 17, 14).
   Number of 3-stars formed by node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
3. Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (nodes 19, 0, 12, 3).
   Number of 3-stars formed by node 8 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
4. Node 12: Node 12 has 4 neighbors (nodes 8, 13, 0, 18).
   Number of 3-stars formed by node 12 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
5. Node 15: Node 15 has 3 neighbors (nodes 16, 4, 18).
   Number of 3-stars formed by node 15 = 1

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
