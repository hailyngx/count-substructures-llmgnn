Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 26) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (0, 10) (0, 21) (0, 29) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (22, 20) (22, 21) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 24) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 5) (12, 4) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 29) (20, 22) (20, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (28, 7) (28, 25) (4, 11) (4, 12) (19, 5) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 17) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 6) (10, 7) (14, 1) (24, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 12) (13, 3) (13, 27) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 25) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 24) (25, 13) (25, 29) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 24) (7, 23) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 18) (29, 25) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 27) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 29. Let's go ahead and identify the 3-stars in this graph using the provided information.

### Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors

### Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \times 5 + \binom{4}{3} \times 6 + \binom{3}{3} \times 1 + \binom{4}{3} \times 3 + \binom{5}{3} \times 10 = 1 + 20 + 24 + 1 + 12 + 50 = 108 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [108].
