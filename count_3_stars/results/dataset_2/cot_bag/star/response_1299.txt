Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each such node.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 50

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
