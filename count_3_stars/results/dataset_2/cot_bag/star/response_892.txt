Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed for each of these nodes:

Node 3:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <3, (9, 16, 18)>, <3, (9, 16, 3)>, <3, (9, 18, 3)>, <3, (16, 18, 3)>

Node 4:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <4, (17, 18, 11)>, <4, (17, 18, 3)>, <4, (17, 11, 3)>, <4, (18, 11, 3)>

Node 8:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <8, (6, 13, 11)>, <8, (6, 13, 8)>, <8, (13, 11, 8)>, <8, (6, 11, 8)>

Node 10:
- Total neighbors: \( 5 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: <10, (13, 5, 7)>, <10, (13, 12, 10)>, <10, (13, 7, 10)>, <10, (13, 3, 10)>, <10, (5, 7, 10)>, <10, (5, 12, 10)>, <10, (5, 3, 10)>, <10, (7, 12, 10)>, <10, (7, 3, 10)>, <10, (12, 3, 10)>

Node 13:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <13, (8, 2, 11)>, <13, (8, 2, 13)>, <13, (8, 10, 7)>, <13, (2, 10, 13)>

Node 14:
- Total neighbors: \( 3 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <14, (17, 0, 5)>

Node 15:
- Total neighbors: \( 2 \)
- Number of 3-stars: No 3-stars can be formed.

Node 16:
- Total neighbors: \( 3 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <16, (9, 1, 3)>

Node 17:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <17, (14, 18, 4)>, <17, (18, 4, 11)>, <17, (14, 4, 17)>, <17, (14, 18, 17)>

Node 18:
- Total neighbors: \( 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <18, (17, 4, 11)>, <18, (17, 4, 3)>, <18, (17, 11, 18)>, <18, (4, 11, 3)>

Adding up the 3-stars from each node:
\( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [45] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 45.
