Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 0) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (5, 10) (5, 15) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33 \). 
So, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 14)>
<1, (8, 13, 16)>
<2, (0, 7, 14)>
<3, (0, 17, 6)>
<4, (3, 18, 9)>
<8, (1, 13, 16)>
<9, (0, 10, 18)>
<10, (5, 8, 15)>
<11, (4, 6, 17)>
<13, (2, 14, 7)>
<15, (5, 18, 19)>
<18, (9, 15, 19)>
<19, (8, 15, 18)>
