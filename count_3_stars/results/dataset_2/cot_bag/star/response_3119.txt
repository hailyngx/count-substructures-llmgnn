Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 8) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 13) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 23) (22, 19) (22, 17) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 23) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 14) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 18) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 16) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 5) (0, 19) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 10) (2, 27) (2, 1) (14, 15) (21, 19) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 1) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 23) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (18, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to find the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29), there is only 1 3-star possible.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we use the formula  $ \binom{n}{3} $ to find the number of 3-stars. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars and find the unique 3-stars. 

1- Nodes with 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1: <1, (6, 11, 4)>
   - Node 4: <4, (1, 11, 5)>
   - Node 5: <5, (4, 18, 7)>
   - Node 8: <8, (9, 12, 25)>
   - Node 13: <13, (27, 26, 16)>
   - Node 15: <15, (17, 14, 10)>
   - Node 16: <16, (13, 29, 23)>
   - Node 18: <18, (24, 29, 5)>
   - Node 20: <20, (17, 29, 22)>
   - Node 23: <23, (26, 16, 24)>
   - Node 24: <24, (26, 18, 23)>
   - Node 25: <25, (8, 29, 1)>
   - Node 29: <29, (20, 25, 18)>

2- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
   - Node 6:  $ \binom{4}{3} $ = 4 3-stars
   - Node 17:  $ \binom{5}{3} $ = 10 3-stars
   - Node 19:  $ \binom{5}{3} $ = 10 3-stars
   - Node 26:  $ \binom{4}{3} $ = 4 3-stars
   - Node 27:  $ \binom{3}{3} $ = 1 3-star
   - Node 28:  $ \binom{4}{3} $ = 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30 3-stars

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [30].
