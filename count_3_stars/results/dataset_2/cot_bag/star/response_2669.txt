Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (27, 5) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 16) (2, 18) (2, 23) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 12) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 21) (22, 17) (22, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 26) (12, 14) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 10) (10, 19) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 6) (11, 6) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 25) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 23) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 19) (23, 2) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 0) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 4) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 25) (25, 24) (25, 28) (4, 16) (4, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 28) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 45. So, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (14, 27, 28)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<7, (19, 21, 28)>
<13, (14, 21, 16)>
<14, (5, 13, 14)>
<16, (27, 4, 16)>
<17, (20, 26, 22)>
<18, (2, 12, 23)>
<23, (0, 18, 23)>
<24, (11, 24, 25)>
<26, (6, 17, 26)>
<27, (5, 16, 27)>
<28, (4, 5, 28)>
