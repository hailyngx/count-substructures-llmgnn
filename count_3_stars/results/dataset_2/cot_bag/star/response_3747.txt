Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
(4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 6), (4, 3), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 2), 
(1, 14), (1, 9), (1, 8), 
(3, 4), (3, 13), (3, 8), 
(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 0), 
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 5), (8, 11), 
(5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 10), 
(13, 3), (13, 11), (13, 10), (13, 6), 
(0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), 
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8), (9, 12), 
(12, 4), (12, 9), (12, 14), 
(6, 4), (6, 13), (6, 0), (6, 11), 
(11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 6), (11, 14), 
(14, 1), (14, 12), (14, 11), (14, 10), 
(10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 13), (10, 14)
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 7, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 14, 9, 8
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9, 10, 0
- Node 3: 4, 13, 8
- Node 4: 7, 12, 6, 3
- Node 5: 8, 0, 10
- Node 6: 4, 13, 0, 11
- Node 7: 4, 0, 11, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 2, 9, 5, 11
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8, 12
- Node 10: 2, 5, 13, 14
- Node 11: 7, 8, 13, 6, 14
- Node 12: 4, 9, 14
- Node 13: 3, 11, 10, 6
- Node 14: 1, 12, 11, 10

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 6
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 12, 3
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 11, 2
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 9
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 13, 14
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 10, 11
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, 12

Adding up the 3-stars for each applicable node, we get a total of 14 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 12, 3)>, <7, (0, 11, 2)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 9)>, <11, (7, 13, 14)>, <13, (3, 10, 11)>, <14, (1, 10, 12)>
