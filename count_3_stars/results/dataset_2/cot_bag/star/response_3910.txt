Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 0) (21, 7) (21, 15) (22, 23) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 26) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 16) (20, 12) (20, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (9, 7) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (28, 8) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 12) (25, 26) (25, 9) (25, 6) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 19) (14, 8) (14, 19) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 19) (6, 10) (6, 25) (1, 22) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 1) (16, 4) (4, 15) (4, 16) (13, 29) (13, 9) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 20) 

Response:
There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions from each node, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 21> <7, 10, 3> <9, 24, 8> <15, 17, 21> <19, 12, 24> <22, 23, 1> <26, 16, 1>
