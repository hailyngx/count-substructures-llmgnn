Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 19) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are 38 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (7, 9, 15)>
<5, (7, 9, 13)>
<5, (9, 13, 15)>
<5, (9, 13, 15)>
<5, (9, 13, 15)>
<5, (9, 13, 15)>
<6, (1, 9, 16)>
<7, (5, 9, 15)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<7, (9, 10, 13)>
<7, (9, 10, 13)>

<9, (7, 10, 13)>
<11, (3, 19, 2)>
<13, (5, 9, 15)>
<15, (5, 9, 13)>
<16, (6, 12, 7)>
<19, (11, 2, 18)>

Putting this in brackets: [38]
