Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 18) (9, 1) (9, 24) (9, 23) (1, 9) (1, 21) (1, 16) (1, 19) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 10) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 17) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 5) (11, 26) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 7) (4, 12) (4, 25) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 22) (22, 3) (22, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 12) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 25) (8, 25) (8, 16) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 7) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 25) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 16) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 18) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 1
- Node 12 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 5
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 3
- Node 22 has degree 3
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 4
- Node 25 has degree 4
- Node 26 has degree 5
- Node 27 has degree 2
- Node 28 has degree 2
- Node 29 has degree 3

Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 2\times \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + 2\times \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + 2\times \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = [69]\).
