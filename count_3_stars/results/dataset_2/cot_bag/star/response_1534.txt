Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 2) (19, 5) (19, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 5) (15, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 17) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 17) (8, 16) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 5, 9, 6, 1, 15, 2, 17, 0, 3, 7, 14, 4, and 16. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 15 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
6. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so no 3-star is formed.
9. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
10. Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
11. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 35 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35]. The unique 3-stars are: <5, (9, 15, 19)>, <9, (5, 6, 12)>, <6, (9, 1, 14)>, <1, (6, 12, 14)>, <3, (5, 7, 14)>, <7, (6, 3, 17)>, <14, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (9, 10, 16)>, and <16, (2, 4, 8)>.
