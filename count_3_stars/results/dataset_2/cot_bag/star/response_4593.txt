Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (15, 18) (15, 8) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [36].
