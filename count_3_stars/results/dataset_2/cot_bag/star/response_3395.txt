Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 1
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 2

Next, let's look at nodes with a degree of 3 or more, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 18.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (10, 11, 18)>, 
<1, (3, 12, 13)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 13)>, 
<3, (1, 14, 19)>, 
<5, (2, 12, 17)>, 
<9, (3, 5, 11)>, 
<10, (0, 14, 18)>, 
<11, (0, 9, 18)>, 
<12, (1, 5, 17)>, 
<17, (5, 12, 18)>
