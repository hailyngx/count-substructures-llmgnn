Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 8, 10)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 11)>
<4, (0, 2, 10)>
<5, (6, 7, 13)>
<6, (2, 5, 12)>
<7, (0, 10, 14)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<10, (1, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 12)>
<13, (1, 5, 11)>
<14, (7, 10, 14)>
