Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 1, 3, 8, 13, 2, 5, 6, 11, 4, 0, 10, 14, and 9.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
4. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
6. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
8. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
9. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
11. Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
13. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of \(4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 82 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 14)>, 
<3, (1, 14, 10)>, 
<8, (1, 13, 11)>, 
<8, (13, 4, 0)>, 
<8, (2, 11, 6)>, 
<8, (6, 2, 5)>, 
<13, (8, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (8, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 9, 6)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 10)>, 
<6, (8, 13, 2)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 10)>, 
<11, (3, 8, 7)>, 
<4, (13, 12, 14)>, 
<0, (8, 13, 10)>, 
<10, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<14, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<14, (5, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (7, 12, 2)>
