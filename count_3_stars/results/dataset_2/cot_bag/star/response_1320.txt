Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 5 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
