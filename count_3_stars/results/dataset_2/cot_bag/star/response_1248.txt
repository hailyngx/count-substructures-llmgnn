Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 13) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 21) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 24) (7, 18) (7, 1) (3, 13) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 29) (21, 22) (21, 9) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 18) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 29) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 2) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 26) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 15) (20, 29) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 20) (29, 24) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 14) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 23) (15, 28) (16, 25) (16, 2) (16, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (28, 8) (28, 15) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 4) (24, 29) (24, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 24) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 15) (12, 1) (12, 17) (17, 19) (17, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 13, 22, 5, 9, 4, 3, 25, 21, 0, 27, 26, 18, 8, 29, 10, 15, 16, 1, 24, 19, 2, 23, and 17.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each such node:

1. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 22, 26, 5, 3, 15. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 13, 10, 21, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 13, 9, 9. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
4. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 21. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 23, 0, 24. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
6. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 13, 25, 23. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
7. Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 3, 16, 29. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
8. Node 21 has 2 neighbors: 22, 9. No 3-star can be formed.
9. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 27, 18, 26. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
10. Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 0, 18, 6. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
11. Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 13, 0, 18, 2. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
12. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 7, 0, 27, 26. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
13. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 22, 9, 28, 15. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
14. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 25, 6, 20, 24. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
15. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 22, 1, 14. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
16. Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 13, 8, 23, 28. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
17. Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 25, 2, 14. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
18. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 19, 12. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
19. Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 4, 29, 2. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
20. Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 17. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
21. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 26, 16, 11, 24. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
22. Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 4, 3, 15. Only 1 3-star can be formed.
23. Node 17 has 2 neighbors: 19, 12. No 3-star can be formed.

We found a total of 50 3-stars.

So the final count of 3-stars is [50].
