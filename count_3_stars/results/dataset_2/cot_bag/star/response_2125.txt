Response:
There are 30 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars around it:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 20, 17, 29, 25, 6. This node forms  [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
<0, (20, 17, 29)> <0, (20, 17, 25)> <0, (20, 17, 6)> <0, (20, 29, 25)> <0, (20, 29, 6)> <0, (20, 25, 6)> <0, (17, 29, 25)> <0, (17, 29, 6)> <0, (17, 25, 6)> <0, (29, 25, 6)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 20, 27, 18. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<1, (3, 20, 27)> <1, (3, 20, 18)> <1, (3, 27, 18)> <1, (20, 27, 18)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 17, 14, 4. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<3, (1, 17, 14)> <3, (1, 17, 4)> <3, (1, 14, 4)> <3, (17, 14, 4)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 26, 23. This node forms 1 3-star.
<6, (0, 26, 23)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 21, 16, 28, 8. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<7, (21, 16, 28)> <7, (21, 16, 8)> <7, (21, 28, 8)> <7, (16, 28, 8)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 24, 14, 13. This node forms 1 3-star.
<9, (24, 14, 13)>

Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 3, 8, 9, 2, 12. This node forms  [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
<14, (3, 8, 9)> <14, (3, 8, 2)> <14, (3, 8, 12)> <14, (3, 9, 2)> <14, (3, 9, 12)> <14, (3, 2, 12)> <14, (8, 9, 2)> <14, (8, 9, 12)> <14, (8, 2, 12)> <14, (9, 2, 12)>

Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 7, 13, 4. This node forms 1 3-star.
<16, (7, 13, 4)>

Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 20, 26, 25, 24. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<19, (20, 26, 25)> <19, (20, 26, 24)> <19, (20, 25, 24)> <19, (26, 25, 24)>

Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 11, 1, 0, 19. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<20, (11, 1, 0)> <20, (11, 1, 19)> <20, (11, 0, 19)> <20, (1, 0, 19)>

Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 7, 23, 25, 15. This node forms  [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
<21, (7, 23, 25)> <21, (7, 23, 15)> <21, (7, 25, 15)> <21, (23, 25, 15)>

Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 19, 9, 18. This node forms 1 3-star.
<24, (19, 9, 18)>

Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 19, 5, 6. This node forms 1 3-star.
<26, (19, 5, 6)>

Node 27 has 3 neighbors: 1, 18, 13. This node forms 1 3-star.
<27, (1, 18, 13)>

Node 29 has 2 neighbors: 11, 0. This node doesn't form any 3-stars.

After analyzing each node, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
