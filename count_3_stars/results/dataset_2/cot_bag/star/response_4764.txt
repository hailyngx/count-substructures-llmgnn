Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

We can see that the nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 64

So, the total number of 3-stars is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
