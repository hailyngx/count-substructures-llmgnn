This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 7, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 14, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 11, 5, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 1, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 11, 8, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 0, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 1, 7, 2}

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, so [1] 3-star.
  <0, (9, 7, 2)>

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so [4] 3-stars.
  <1, (3, 5, 4)>
  <1, (3, 8, 5)>
  <1, (4, 8, 7)>
  <1, (4, 8, 1)>

- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors, so [1] 3-star.
  <2, (8, 14, 0)>

- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so [4] 3-stars.
  <3, (1, 5, 4)>
  <3, (1, 8, 5)>
  <3, (4, 8, 7)>
  <3, (4, 8, 1)>

- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors, so [10] 3-stars.
  <4, (6, 1, 3)>
