Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (22, 28) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 29) (15, 20) (15, 6) (0, 27) (0, 7) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 16) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 18) (21, 2) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 25) (17, 23) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 10) (29, 3) (29, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 28) (9, 27) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 23) (24, 25) (2, 21) (2, 11) (16, 27) (16, 9) (16, 6) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 24) (25, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 28) (10, 18) (10, 12) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 9) (23, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 12) 

Response:
There are five nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 7, 9, 18, and 23. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

1. Node 3:
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <3, (1, 5, 7)>
        - <3, (1, 5, 29)>
        - <3, (5, 7, 23)>
        - <3, (7, 21, 23)>

2. Node 7:
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <7, (1, 3, 21)>
        - <7, (3, 21, 23)>
        - <7, (3, 21, 7)>
        - <7, (3, 23, 9)>

3. Node 9:
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <9, (8, 11, 16)>
        - <9, (8, 11, 23)>
        - <9, (8, 16, 27)>
        - <9, (8, 23, 25)>
        - <9, (11, 20, 23)>
        - <9, (11, 20, 27)>
        - <9, (11, 20, 9)>
        - <9, (11, 23, 25)>
        - <9, (11, 23, 27)>
        - <9, (16, 23, 27)>

4. Node 18:
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <18, (4, 10, 21)>
        - <18, (4, 21, 26)>
        - <18, (10, 12, 18)>
        - <18, (11, 18, 21)>

5. Node 23:
    - Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <23, (7, 17, 25)>
        - <23, (9, 11, 23)>
        - <23, (9, 16, 23)>
        - <23, (9, 23, 25)>
        - <23, (16, 23, 25)>
        - <23, (17, 23, 25)>
        - <23, (17, 25, 28)>
        - <23, (21, 23, 25)>
        - <23, (25, 27, 23)>
        - <23, (25, 27, 28)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 32, which we put inside brackets: [32].
