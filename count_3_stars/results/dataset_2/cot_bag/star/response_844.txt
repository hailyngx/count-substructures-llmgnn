Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 13, 23}
- Node 1: {5, 18, 27}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 25, 27}
- Node 3: {6, 10, 21, 28}
- Node 4: {20, 27}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11, 13, 22}
- Node 6: {3, 15}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 19}
- Node 8: {2, 17, 21}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 9, 22}
- Node 11: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 12: {17, 19, 27}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 18, 25}
- Node 14: {19, 29}
- Node 15: {6, 16, 17}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {8, 12, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 13, 26, 28}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 20: {4, 22, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 8}
- Node 22: {5, 10, 20}
- Node 23: {0}
- Node 24: {20, 26, 29}
- Node 25: {2, 13}
- Node 26: {18, 24}
- Node 27: {1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 28: {3, 18}
- Node 29: {14, 16, 24}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars each node forms:
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1] = [52] \]

Therefore, there are 52 unique 3-stars present in the given graph.
