Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are three nodes with fewer than three neighbors: node 1, node 4, and node 15. Therefore, these nodes cannot be the center of any 3-star.
      
Let's analyze the remaining nodes:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 6 has 4 neighbors, node 8 has 4 neighbors, node 10 has 4 neighbors, node 11 has 4 neighbors, and node 13 has 5 neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 5: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- For node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 8: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 10: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 11: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- For node 13: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

Adding these up gives a total of 36 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 14, 3)>
<0, (1, 9, 14)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<5, (2, 13, 6)>
<5, (3, 14, 11)>
<6, (0, 14, 3)>
<6, (12, 3, 7)>
<8, (12, 1, 0)>
<8, (13, 2, 5)>
<10, (9, 7, 2)>
<10, (7, 12, 3)>
<11, (14, 8, 10)>
<13, (6, 12, 7)>
<13, (4, 3, 5)>
