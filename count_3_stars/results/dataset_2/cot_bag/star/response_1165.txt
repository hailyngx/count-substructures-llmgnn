Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 6 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 0)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
