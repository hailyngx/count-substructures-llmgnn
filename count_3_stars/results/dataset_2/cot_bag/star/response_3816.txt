Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [38].
