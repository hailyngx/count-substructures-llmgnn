Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 9, 6, 3, 4, 8, 2
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 2, 4, 0
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 0, 7, 2
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 6, 3, 8, 7, 0
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 6, 1, 8, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 74

So, the final answer is: [74]
List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
