Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 19) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 17) (3, 10) (0, 16) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (19, 9) (19, 5) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 1 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 2 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 5 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 6 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 7 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 9 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 11 (with 2 neighbors)
- Node 12 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 13 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 15 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 16 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 17 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 18 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 19 (with 2 neighbors)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (Nodes: 6, 15, 16, 17):
- From each 3-neighbor node, one 3-star is formed with the corresponding three neighbors.
- Total 3-stars = 4

For nodes with 4 neighbors (Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 18):
- Total 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 = 64 \)

For nodes with 5 neighbors (Node: 12):
- Total 3-stars formed = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up all 3-stars:
4 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 64 (from nodes with 4 neighbors) + 10 (from nodes with 5 neighbors) = 78

So, there are a total of 78 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 2, 7> 
<0, 2, 12> 
<0, 7, 12> 
<1, 4, 5> 
<1, 4, 15> 
<1, 5, 12> 
<1, 5, 15> 
<2, 5, 12> 
<2, 5, 19> 
<2, 7, 18> 
<5, 12, 15> 
<6, 9, 13> 
<7, 9, 18> 
<9, 18, 19> 
<12, 13, 4>
