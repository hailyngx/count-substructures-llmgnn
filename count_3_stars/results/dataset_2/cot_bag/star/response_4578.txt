Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we find the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 54 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 54 and we list the unique 3-stars inside <> such as:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)> 

So, the final answer is [54].
