Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
In this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars associated with each.

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 15, 6, 9, 2, 4.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 3, 10, 18, 11.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 16, 4.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 17, 0.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 13, 2, 14.
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 8, 17, 1, 7.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 13, 12, 10.
Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 10, 14, 19.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 6, 13, 2, 4.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 16, 11.
Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 9, 0.
Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 12, 18, 11.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 15, 0, 19, 1.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 8, 12.
Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 15, 7, 12.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 13.
Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 15, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 33

Putting this final number in brackets: [33]
