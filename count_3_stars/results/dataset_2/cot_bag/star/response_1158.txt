Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 8) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 27) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 20) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 0) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 16) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 2) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 20) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 25) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 29) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 27) (9, 28) (25, 6) (25, 4) (20, 10) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 21) (20, 16) (1, 24) (1, 2) (1, 28) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 1) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 18) (27, 17) (27, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, no 3-stars formed.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, no 3-stars formed.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, no 3-stars formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 78 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (12, 8, 16)>, <2, (13, 15, 21)>, <3, (13, 15, 4)>, <4, (22, 3, 25)>, <5, (7, 10, 29)>, <7, (20, 18, 5)>, <8, (22, 6, 0)>, <10, (17, 5, 20)>, <13, (22, 2, 3)>, <14, (17, 18, 29)>, <16, (26, 21, 20)>, <17, (10, 29, 27)>, <20, (10, 7, 12)>, <21, (26, 20, 2)>, <22, (13, 4, 8)>, <26, (24, 6, 16)>, <28, (1, 18, 9)>.
