Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 1) (27, 6) (27, 8) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 24) (11, 21) (11, 20) (28, 16) (28, 5) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 22) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 23) (8, 27) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 20) (9, 12) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 10) (18, 16) (18, 7) (19, 29) (19, 20) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (26, 0) (26, 5) (21, 11) (21, 5) (10, 0) (10, 22) (10, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 3) (6, 27) (6, 17) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 13) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 25) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 12) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 20) (14, 25) (4, 1) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 14) (20, 11) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (27, 10, 26), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (27, 15, 4, 22), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (29, 28, 26, 21, 3), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (27, 24, 25, 12), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors (17, 8, 9, 13), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (10, 3, 24, 12), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (27, 29, 20, 25), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (28, 22, 18, 23), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors (6, 12, 15, 7), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors (11, 9, 19, 14), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors (1, 16, 10), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors (15, 16, 25), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors (29, 8, 13), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors (8, 23, 14), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 21), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors (0, 14, 1), so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors (19, 14, 24), so there is 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars we calculated, we get a total of 43 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
