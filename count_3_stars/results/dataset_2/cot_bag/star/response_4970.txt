Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 17) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 16) (19, 4) (19, 14) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 16) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 17) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 11) (17, 12) (16, 4) (16, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \).

Therefore, there are a total of 42 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 16, 19)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 16)>, 
<5, (7, 13, 18)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (5, 11, 13)>, 
<10, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<11, (7, 13, 17)>.
