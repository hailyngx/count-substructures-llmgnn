Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
Graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges:
0 -- 6 -- 8
|    |    |
5 -- 3 -- 1
|         |
7 -- 9    4
|
2
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: has 6 neighbors (6, 3, 5, 2, 8, 7), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 1: has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7), so there is 1 3-star.  
Node 3: has 5 neighbors (6, 1, 7, 5, 0), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 4: has 4 neighbors (1, 8, 2, 5), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5: has 6 neighbors (6, 3, 4, 2, 0, 7), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 6: has 4 neighbors (5, 3, 8, 0), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 59 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
