Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 7

We can see that nodes 5, 9, and 1 have exactly 3 neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>,
  <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>,
  <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>

There are a total of 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [24].
