Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 6, 10, 14
- Node 1: 5, 3, 11, 10
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 1, 11, 4, 13
- Node 4: 3, 10, 13, 7
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 0
- Node 6: 9, 3, 2, 0, 13
- Node 7: 9, 10, 8, 4, 12
- Node 8: 12, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 13, 0
- Node 10: 1, 0, 12, 7, 4
- Node 11: 1, 3, 14
- Node 12: 8, 10, 7, 14
- Node 13: 9, 6, 3, 4
- Node 14: 11, 12, 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

For node 0, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- <0, (5, 9, 10)>
- <0, (5, 9, 14)>
- <0, (5, 6, 10)>
- <0, (5, 6, 14)>
- <0, (5, 10, 14)>
- <0, (9, 6, 10)>
- <0, (9, 6, 14)>
- <0, (9, 10, 14)>
- <0, (6, 10, 14)>

Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 do not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

For node 8, there is inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star.

For node 11 and 12, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star each:
- <11, (1, 3, 14)>
- <12, (7, 10, 14)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
