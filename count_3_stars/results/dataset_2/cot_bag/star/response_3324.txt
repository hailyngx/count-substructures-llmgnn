Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} \) = 0 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 42 3-stars.

So the total number of 3-stars is 42, which means we have 42 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [42]
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
