Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: [1].
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: [10].
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: [10].
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: [1].
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: [4].
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: [10].
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: [10].
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: [4].

Summing up all the 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50 \)

So, there are 50 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (6, 7, 13)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 12)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 10)>, 
<5, (8, 10, 12)>, 
<5, (11, 10, 12)>, 
<5, (11, 8, 12)>, 
<6, (3, 14, 4)>, 
<6, (3, 14, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 13)>, 
<6, (14, 1, 12)>, 
<7, (3, 11, 13)>, 
<10, (2, 8, 12)>, 
<10, (5, 8, 12)>, 
<11, (2, 8, 12)>, 
<13, (0, 3, 5)>
