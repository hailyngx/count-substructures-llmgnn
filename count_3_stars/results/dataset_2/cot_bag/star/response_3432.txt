Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 25) (16, 8) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 3) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 3) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 4) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (22, 6) (23, 1) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (12, 14) (26, 11) (26, 21) (26, 20) (9, 11) (9, 25) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 27) (25, 9) (25, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 5) (0, 28) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 19) (24, 29) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 22) (6, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
7. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
9. Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
11. Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
12. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
14. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
15. Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-star counts: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 11, 20)>, <4, (1, 19, 29)>, <5, (8, 19, 28)>, <11, (1, 26, 29)>, <13, (3, 8, 18)>, <14, (11, 12, 24)>, <16, (8, 10, 25)>, <20, (1, 5, 27)>, <24, (10, 14, 29)>, <25, (16, 19, 27)>, <26, (11, 21, 20)>, <27, (15, 25, 20)>, <28, (0, 5, 24)>, <29, (2, 4, 10)>
