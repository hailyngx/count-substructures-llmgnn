Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 3, 2
- Node 1: 9, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 0
- Node 3: 4, 7, 0
- Node 4: 9, 6, 7, 1, 3
- Node 5: 6, 2, 0
- Node 6: 5, 9, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 4, 3, 2, 1
- Node 8: 9, 6, 0, 1
- Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 1

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 2 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us [12].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
<8, (9, 0, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
