Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 8 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 56 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 131 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 131 3-stars in this graph.
