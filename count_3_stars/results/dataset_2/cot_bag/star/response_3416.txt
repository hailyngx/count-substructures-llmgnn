Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 13) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

So, there are \([31]\) 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (11, 4, 19)>, <2, (6, 15, 19)>, <4, (11, 7, 17)>, <5, (4, 6, 15)>, <6, (2, 5, 13)>, <7, (4, 12, 19)>, <12, (7, 13, 17)>, <13, (6, 12, 3)>, <14, (0, 18, 1)>, <15, (2, 5, 9)>, <17, (4, 12, 8)>
