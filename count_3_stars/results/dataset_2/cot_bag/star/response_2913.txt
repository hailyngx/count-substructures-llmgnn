Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 12) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 15) (29, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 0) (28, 24) (26, 24) (26, 27) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 26) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 27) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 3) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 3) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 19) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (3, 13) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 18) (0, 28) (0, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 27) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 1) (18, 14) (16, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36

So, there are 36 3-stars in total. 

Putting this inside brackets, we have [36].

The unique 3-stars found are <8, (7, 9, 12)>, <8, (12, 13, 25)>, <8, (3, 12, 15)>, <8, (15, 9, 29)>, <8, (17, 22, 4)>, <8, (10, 11, 23)>, <10, (11, 18, 19)>, <11, (19, 0, 4)>, <12, (3, 13, 14)>, <12, (2, 22, 27)>, <12, (8, 10, 23)>, <12, (25, 20, 16)>, <15, (6, 5, 1)>, <20, (25, 12, 8)>, <20, (18, 11, 19)>, <20, (3, 13, 14)>, <20, (16, 27, 9)>, <22, (17, 8, 13)>, <22, (2, 12, 15)>, <22, (4, 21, 24)>, <22, (27, 26, 24)>, <23, (10, 8, 7)>, <24, (21, 4, 22)>, <27, (26, 24, 21)>.
