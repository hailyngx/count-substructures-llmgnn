Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 4
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 5

Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:
- Nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14 have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
  - Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58, which we will represent as [58].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (11, 5, 14)>
- <5, (11, 2, 14)>
- <7, (6, 8, 1)>
- <9, (3, 13, 7)>
