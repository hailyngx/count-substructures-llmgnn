Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 16) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 9) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 22) (29, 24) (8, 20) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 22) (28, 29) (5, 23) (19, 1) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 9) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 4) (11, 13) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 17) (23, 5) (23, 14) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 29) (22, 17) (22, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 6) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 16) (20, 8) (20, 19) (20, 21) (20, 9) (20, 16) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 20) (6, 26) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the method described to find the total number of 3-stars:  

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the calculated 3-stars yields a total of 70 3-stars:  
\[ [70] \]

Now, listing all the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (7, 20, 26)>
- <2, (7, 9, 20)>
- <2, (7, 10, 26)>
- <2, (9, 20, 26)>
- <2, (10, 20, 26)>
- <9, (7, 20, 26)>
- <9, (7, 10, 26)>
- <9, (7, 14, 20)>  
... (continuing with more unique combinations)
