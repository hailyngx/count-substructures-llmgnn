Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 59 \]

Therefore, there are 59 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ <0, (3, 8, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 11)>, <3, (0, 8, 10)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 14)> \]

Putting the final count in brackets: [59].
