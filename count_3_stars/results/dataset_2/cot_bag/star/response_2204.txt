Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 8) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 11, 16, 15, 7, 2, 18, 5, 19, 6, 14, 4, 9, 0, 12, 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 4 3-stars
- Node 15: 10 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 18: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have:

1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 37

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (16, 19, 7)>
<16, (11, 18, 14)>
<15, (3, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 19, 18)>
<2, (15, 19, 13)>
<18, (16, 7, 6)>
<5, (3, 19, 0)>
<19, (11, 16, 7)>
<6, (15, 18, 1)>
<14, (16, 1, 9)>
<4, (7, 17, 12)>
<9, (15, 14, 12)>
<0, (15, 5, 8)>
<12, (9, 17, 8)>
<8, (6, 0, 12)>
