Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Considering only the nodes with three or more neighbors and the fact that there are 15 nodes in total, let's examine each node to see if it can form a 3-star:

1. Node 0 has degree 5: 
    - Possible 3-stars: [[1, 7, 0], [1, 0, 9], [0, 5, 3], [0, 4, 11], [0, 7, 5]]
  
2. Node 1 has degree 5: 
    - Possible 3-stars: [[1, 7, 0], [1, 0, 9], [1, 6, 13], [1, 6, 2], [1, 8, 14]]
  
3. Node 2 has degree 4: 
    - No 3-stars can be formed.
  
4. Node 3 has degree 3: 
    - One 3-star can be formed: [3, 5, 10]
  
5. Node 4 has degree 3: 
    - One 3-star can be formed: [4, 8, 11]
  
6. Node 5 has degree 3: 
    - One 3-star can be formed: [5, 0, 3]
  
7. Node 6 has degree 4: 
    - No 3-stars can be formed.

8. Node 7 has degree 4: 
    - Possible 3-stars: [[1, 7, 0], [7, 13, 6], [7, 9, 11]]
    
9. Node 8 has degree 6:
    - Possible 3-stars: [[1, 8, 14], [8, 12, 6], [8, 3, 10], [8, 10, 14], [8, 4, 11]]
    
10. Node 9 has degree 5:
    - Possible 3-stars: [[7, 9, 11], [9, 1, 0], [9, 12, 6], [9, 0, 4], [9, 12, 8]]
    
11. Node 10 has degree 5:
    - Possible 3-stars: [[8, 3, 10], [8, 10, 14], [10, 2, 14], [10, 5, 0], [10, 2, 6]]
  
12. Node 11 has degree 3:
    - One 3-star can be formed: [4, 8, 11]

13. Node 12 has degree 4:
    - No 3-stars can be formed.
    
14. Node 13 has degree 4:
    - No 3-stars can be formed.
    
15. Node 14 has degree 4:
    - No 3-stars can be formed.
    
Adding up the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [16]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 7, 0>, <1, 0, 9>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 4, 11>, <1, 6, 13>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 10>, <4, 8, 11>, <7, 13, 6>, <7, 9, 11>, <8, 12, 6>, <8, 3, 10>, <8, 10, 14>, <7, 9, 11>, <10, 2, 14>.
