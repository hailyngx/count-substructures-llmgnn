Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (0, 7), (0, 8), (8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3)}

Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 8)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 8)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 0, 1)>, <7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>, <7, (6, 8, 1)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 2, 1)>, <7, (6, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 1, 3)>
~20 3-stars in total~
