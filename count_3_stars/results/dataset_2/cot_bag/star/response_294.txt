Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 8) (19, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 18) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's find the total number of 3-stars formed:

For node 1: it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: it has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
For node 8: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 9: it has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 11: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 13: it has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 15: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 16: it has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed by the specified nodes: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 15, 17)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<8, (15, 18, 9)>
<16, (0, 2, 3)>
<16, (2, 5, 16)>
<16, (2, 6, 16)>
<16, (3, 6, 7)>
