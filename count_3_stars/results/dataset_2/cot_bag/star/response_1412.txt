Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Edges: 
(0, 13), (0, 9), (0, 2), 
(1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), 
(2, 7), (2, 0), (2, 14), 
(3, 1), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 8), 
(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 6), 
(5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 11), (5, 13), 
(6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 11), 
(7, 4), (7, 12), (7, 14), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 1), 
(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 9), (8, 14), 
(9, 3), (9, 11), (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 13), 
(10, 4), (10, 11), (10, 6), (10, 12), 
(11, 10), (11, 9), (11, 5), (11, 6), 
(12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 13), 
(13, 12), (13, 0), (13, 5), (13, 9), 
(14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 8), (14, 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 11, 8, 13, 9, and 6. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
[1 3-star from node 4] + [inom{5}{3}] + [1 3-star from node 6] = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 6, 10)>, <7, (4, 1, 12)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 9, 5)>, <10, (4, 11, 6)>, <11, (10, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 9, 14)>, <13, (12, 0, 5)>, <9, (3, 11, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 11)>
