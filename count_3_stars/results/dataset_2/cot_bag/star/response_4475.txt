Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars and list them.

Let's list the nodes with their degrees for reference:
- Node 0: deg = 4
- Node 1: deg = 4
- Node 2: deg = 3
- Node 3: deg = 2
- Node 4: deg = 2
- Node 5: deg = 3
- Node 6: deg = 3
- Node 7: deg = 4
- Node 8: deg = 3
- Node 9: deg = 4
- Node 10: deg = 4
- Node 11: deg = 2
- Node 12: deg = 3
- Node 13: deg = 3
- Node 14: deg = 2
- Node 15: deg = 4
- Node 16: deg = 3
- Node 17: deg = 4
- Node 18: deg = 3
- Node 19: deg = 3
- Node 20: deg = 4
- Node 21: deg = 3
- Node 22: deg = 4
- Node 23: deg = 3
- Node 24: deg = 3
- Node 25: deg = 2
- Node 26: deg = 2
- Node 27: deg = 1
- Node 28: deg = 3
- Node 29: deg = 4

Based on the degrees, we can see that the nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0, 1, 7, 9, 10, 17, 20, and 29 have 4 neighbors each, giving each of them \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, and 24 have 3 neighbors each, giving each of them \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Nodes 2, 6, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22 have 3 neighbors each, giving each of them \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( (8 \times 4) + (6 \times 1) + (7 \times 1) = 32 + 6 + 7 = 45 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (17, 20, 29)>, <1, (4, 7, 17)>, <2, (3, 10, 20)>, <5, (18, 8, 15)>, <6, (13, 14, 21)>, <9, (17, 4, 21)>,
<12, (18, 24, 7)>, <15, (23, 24, 7)>, <16, (19, 26, 28)>, <18, (12, 5, 22)>, <19, (21, 16, 28)>, <20, (10, 2, 8)>,
<21, (9, 14, 19)>, <22, (7, 29, 18)>
