Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Here is the list of unique 3-stars with their central nodes and leaves:

[ 4 ]

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>         

There are 29 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [29].
