Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 20) (8, 21) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (2, 8) (2, 10) (11, 28) (11, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 3) (9, 7) (17, 11) (17, 6) (7, 9) (7, 24) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 18) (19, 29) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 1) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 18) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 23) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 16) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 15) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 15) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 21) (12, 5) (12, 26) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 6) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars based on the given graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 17>
<4, 8, 21>
<9, 21, 25>
<10, 2, 8>
<14, 15, 25>
<27, 10, 16>
<29, 9, 25>
<28, 11, 17>
