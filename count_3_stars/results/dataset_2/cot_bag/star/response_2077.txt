Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 13) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 17) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (12, 2) (12, 17) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 14) (15, 8) (15, 13) (9, 11) (9, 16) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3

We need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Calculating \( \binom{5}{3} \) for node 2, we find that there are 10 3-stars centered at node 2. 
Calculating \( \binom{4}{3} \) for nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 18, we find that there are 4 3-stars for each of these nodes, resulting in a total of 32 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 8(4)] = 42.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 13)>
- <0, (2, 11, 17)>
- <1, (4, 6, 10)>
- <3, (2, 11, 19)>
- <6, (2, 5, 14)>
- <8, (4, 15, 19)>
- <11, (0, 3, 9)>
- <13, (0, 10, 15)>
- <18, (2, 3, 6)>
