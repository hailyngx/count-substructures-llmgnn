Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 2) (2, 19) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 18) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 26 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: \[26\]

Unique 3-stars:

1. <4, (8, 9, 16)>
2. <5, (6, 7, 11)>
3. <10, (6, 15, 19)>
4. <11, (5, 9, 18)>
