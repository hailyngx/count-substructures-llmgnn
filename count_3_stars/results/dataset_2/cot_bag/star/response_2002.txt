Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6)
(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8)
(2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8)
(4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9)
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6)
(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 40 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 6, 1)>, <6, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 8, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>
