Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18. For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node.

Let's go through each node:

Node 0:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 4:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 5:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 8:
It has 5 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 8 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Therefore, we have [10].

Node 9:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 11:
It has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 11. Therefore, we have [1].

Node 12:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 12 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 13:
It has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 13. Therefore, we have [1].

Node 14:
It has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 14. Therefore, we have [1].

Node 16:
It has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star formed with node 16. Therefore, we have [1].

Node 17:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 17 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Node 18:
It has 4 neighbors. The total number of 3-stars formed with node 18 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Therefore, we have [4].

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [36].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 36. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 17, 12>, <4, 1, 18>, <5, 17, 12>, <8, 15, 7>, <9, 18, 19>, <11, 14, 18>.
