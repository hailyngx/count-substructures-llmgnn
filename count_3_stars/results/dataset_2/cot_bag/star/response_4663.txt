Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {4, 2, 13}
Node 1: {6, 13, 11, 14}
Node 2: {8, 6, 14, 11, 0}
Node 3: {8, 5, 14, 9}
Node 4: {8, 9, 0}
Node 5: {8, 6, 13, 3}
Node 6: {2, 5, 1, 10}
Node 7: {8, 10, 14}
Node 8: {4, 2, 5, 11, 7, 3}
Node 9: {4, 12, 11, 3}
Node 10: {7, 12, 6, 13}
Node 11: {8, 2, 1, 9}
Node 12: {10, 9}
Node 13: {5, 1, 10, 14, 0}
Node 14: {7, 2, 13, 1, 3}

Now we'll identify how many 3-stars can be formed around each node:

Node 0: [1]
<0, (4, 2, 13)>

Node 1: [1]
<1, (6, 13, 11)>

Node 2: [3]
<2, (8, 6, 0)>
<2, (8, 5, 0)>
<2, (8, 11, 1)>

Node 3: [1]
<3, (8, 5, 14)>

Node 4: [1]
<4, (8, 9, 0)>

Node 5: [1]
<5, (8, 6, 13)>

Node 6: [1]
<6, (2, 5, 1)>

Node 7: [1]
<7, (8, 10, 14)>

Node 8: [3]
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<8, (11, 7, 3)>

Node 9: [1]
<9, (4, 12, 11)>

Node 10: [1]
<10, (7, 12, 6)>

Node 11: [1]
<11, (8, 2, 1)>

Node 12: [1]
<12, (10, 9, 4)>

Node 13: [1]
<13, (5, 1, 14)>

Node 14: [1]
<14, (7, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
