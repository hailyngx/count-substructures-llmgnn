Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, with the following connections:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 3)
Node 1: 5 neighbors (5, 7, 0, 8, 2)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (9, 4, 0, 1)
Node 3: 3 neighbors (9, 0, 8)
Node 4: 5 neighbors (5, 9, 6, 7, 2)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (6, 1, 4)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (5, 9, 4, 0)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (4, 1)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (9, 1, 3)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (6, 8, 4, 2)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node, we have:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 7, 2)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (7, 0, 1)>
- <4, (7, 0, 2)>
- <4, (7, 0, 6)>
- <4, (9, 2, 6)>
- <4, (9, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (8, 1, 3)>
