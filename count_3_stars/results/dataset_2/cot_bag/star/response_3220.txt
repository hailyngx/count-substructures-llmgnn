Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 9, 11)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 10)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <7, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (1, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 13, 14)>, <7, (8, 13, 14)>, <7, (8, 13, 10)>, <7, (8, 13, 14)>, <7, (10, 13, 14)>, <7, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 13, 14)>, <6, (0, 12, 13)>, <6, (0, 12, 14)>, <6, (12, 13, 14)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 11, 13)>, <8, (2, 11, 8)>, <8, (2, 8, 13)>, <8, (11, 13, 8)>
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <13, (7, 10, 14)>, <13, (7, 10, 1)>, <13, (7, 10, 13)>, <13, (7, 14, 10)>, <13, (7, 14, 10)>, <13, (10, 14, 7)>, <13, (10, 14, 7)>, <13, (10, 14, 7)>, <13, (10, 14, 13)>, <13, (14, 7, 10)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 12)>, <1, (0, 5, 10)>, <1, (0, 12, 5)>, <1, (5, 10, 12)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 12)>, <5, (0, 1, 10)>, <5, (0, 10, 1)>, <5, (1, 10, 12)>, <5, (1, 10, 12)>, <5, (1, 10, 0)>, <5, (1, 12, 0)>, <5, (10, 12, 0)>, <5, (10, 12, 1)>, <5, (12, 0, 1)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <2, (4, 11, 8)>, <2, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (11, 8, 4)>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <11, (0, 3, 8)>, <11, (0, 3, 11)>, <11, (3, 8, 0)>, <11, (3, 8, 11)>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <14, (3, 6, 13)>, <14, (3, 6, 12)>, <14, (3, 12, 6)>, <14, (6, 12, 3)>, <14, (6, 13, 3)>, <14, (6, 13, 10)>, <14, (6, 13, 7)>, <14, (12, 6, 3)>, <14, (12, 6, 13)>, <14, (12, 3, 6)>
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <12, (1, 3, 5)>, <12, (1, 5, 0)>, <12, (3, 5, 1)>, <12, (5, 0, 1)>
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <10, (1, 5, 7)>, <10, (1, 7, 10)>, <10, (5, 1, 12)>, <10, (5, 12, 1)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [51].
