Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of those nodes.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, there are 72 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting the final count inside brackets:
[72]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
