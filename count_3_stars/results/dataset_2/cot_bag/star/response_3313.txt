Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 13
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9, 10, and 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 12, and 14
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 12, and 14
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 10, and 12
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 13
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 12, and 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 12, and 14
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 10, and 11
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 11

Now, we will analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars it participates in.

For node 0: Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 1 [<0, 2, 9>, <1, 9, 13> are three-stars]  
For node 2 [<0, 2, 9>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 10> are three-stars]  
For node 3 [<5, 10, 12>, <3, 11, 14>, <3, 8, 12> are three-stars]    
For node 4 [<1, 9, 11>, <4, 9, 11>, <4, 12, 14> are three-stars]  
For node 5 [<5, 10, 12>, <5, 6, 8> are three-stars]  
For node 6 [<2, 6, 10>, <5, 6, 8> are three-stars]  
For node 7: Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 8 [<3, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 12> are three-stars]  
For node 9 [<1, 9, 13>, <4, 9, 11>, <9, 11, 13> are three-stars]     
For node 10 [<2, 6, 10>, <5, 10, 12>, <9, 10, 13> are three-stars] 
For node 11 [<3, 8, 12>, <4, 9, 11>, <9, 11, 13>, <11, 12, 14> are three-stars]  
For node 12 [<5, 10, 12>, <4, 12, 14>, <3, 8, 12> are three-stars]  
For node 13 [<1, 9, 13>, <2, 6, 10>, <9, 10, 13>, <11, 13, 14> are three-stars]  
For node 14 [<3, 8, 12>, <4, 12, 14>, <11, 12, 14> are three-stars]  

Summing up, there are 34 unique 3-stars found inside <> and the total number of 3-stars is [34].
