Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 92

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 10, 13)>
<2, (4, 7, 11)>
<2, (4, 10, 13)>
<2, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (2, 7, 10)>
<4, (2, 10, 11)>
<4, (6, 7, 13)>
<4, (7, 10, 13)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 10, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 13)>
<9, (4, 10, 11)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<10, (0, 7, 13)>
<10, (2, 4, 11)>
<10, (4, 6, 13)>
<10, (7, 9, 13)>
<11, (2, 4, 10)>
<11, (4, 10, 13)>
<13, (0, 4, 7)>
<13, (4, 6, 10)>
<14, (0, 7, 9)>
<14, (3, 4, 7)>
