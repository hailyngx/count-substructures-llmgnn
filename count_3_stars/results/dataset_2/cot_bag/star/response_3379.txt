Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 28) (22, 20) (5, 27) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (10, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (4, 23) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 14) (28, 23) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 29) (0, 17) (0, 25) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 28) (18, 10) (18, 11) (29, 1) (29, 24) (29, 6) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 24) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (15, 17) (15, 14) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 0) (25, 16) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 13, 9, 8, 24
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 22, 26, 12, 2, 27
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 7, 28, 3, 15
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 22, 9, 25
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 21, 6, 0, 15
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 11, 7, 12, 24
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 28, 25, 17
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 13, 16, 28, 20
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 9, 11, 4, 28
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 2, 26, 19, 29
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 21, 26, 0, 16
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 13, 24, 20, 25
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors: 22, 21, 14, 23

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: There's 1 3-star <16, (22, 9, 25)>
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: There's 1 3-star <21, (28, 25, 17)>
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 \)

So, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in the given graph.
