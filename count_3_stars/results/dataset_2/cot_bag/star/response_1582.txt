Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

1: 4, 6, 9, 2, 5
2: 7, 1, 3, 0
3: 4, 7, 6, 0, 2
4: 7, 3, 1
5: 8, 1
6: 1, 3, 8, 0
7: 4, 3, 9, 2, 8
8: 7, 6, 9, 5, 0
9: 7, 8, 1

Now let's check each node to see if they can form a 3-star:

Node 1: 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2: 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3: 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4: 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 5: 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 6: 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7: 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8: 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9: 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Thus, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 1, 3)>, <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>.
