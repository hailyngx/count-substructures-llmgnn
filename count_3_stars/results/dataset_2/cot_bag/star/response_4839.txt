Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (3, 15) (3, 29) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 23) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 20) (0, 27) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 16) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 14) (11, 24) (11, 2) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 14) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 21) (20, 4) (20, 18) (5, 13) (5, 2) (26, 15) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 23) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 25) (19, 28) (19, 21) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 16) (25, 10) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 17) (24, 11) (24, 8) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 9) (16, 27) (16, 17) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 19) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph are: 
- Node 1 with neighbors 4, 7, 15, and 23
- Node 2 with neighbors 5, 11, 18, and 22
- Node 6 with neighbors 8, 9, 12, and 29
- Node 9 with neighbors 6, 14, 21, and 25 
- Node 13 with neighbors 5, 15, and 23
- Node 15 with neighbors 1, 3, 13, and 26
- Node 18 with neighbors 2, 20, 22, and 23
- Node 22 with neighbors 2, 14, 18, and 23
- Node 25 with neighbors 8, 9, 17, and 10
- Node 29 with neighbors 3, 6, 9, 21, and 28 

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43 \)

So, there are a total of 43 3-stars in the provided graph. 
Putting this final number inside brackets: [43]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 7, 15)>
<2, (5, 11, 18)>
<6, (8, 9, 12)>
<6, (8, 9, 29)>
<9, (6, 14, 21)>
<9, (6, 14, 25)>
<13, (5, 15, 23)>
<15, (1, 3, 26)>
<18, (2, 20, 23)>
<22, (2, 14, 23)>
<25, (8, 17, 25)>
<29, (6, 9, 21)>
<29, (6, 9, 28)>
<29, (6, 21, 28)>
<29, (9, 21, 28)>
