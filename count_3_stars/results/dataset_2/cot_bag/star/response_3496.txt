Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given set of edges, we can identify that nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

1. For Node 0: 
    - Neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>

2. For Node 1:
    - Neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, and more...

3. For Node 3:
    - Neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>

4. For Node 6:
    - Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>

5. For Node 8:
    - Neighbors: 4, 7, 9, 1, 2
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (4, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, and more...

6. For Node 9:
    - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
    - Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, and more...

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 52.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].
