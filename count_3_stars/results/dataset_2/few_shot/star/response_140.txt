Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 5: <0, (6, 1, 5)>

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 5: <1, (6, 8, 5)>

Next, Node 2:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 8: <2, (6, 9, 8)>

Then, Node 3:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 0: <3, (9, 8, 0)>

Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 5: <4, (7, 9, 5)>

Next, Node 6:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 2: <6, (9, 1, 2)>

Lastly, Node 8:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 2: <8, (7, 9, 2)>

Combining all unique 3-stars, we get:
[<0, (6, 1, 5)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>]
