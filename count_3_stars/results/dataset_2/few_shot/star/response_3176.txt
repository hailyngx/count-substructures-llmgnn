Response:
We can identify 3-star graphs by locating nodes that have exactly three neighbors. The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 18)>
<2, (0, 7, 19)>
<3, (11, 7, 12)>
<4, (9, 8, 10)>
<5, (9, 12, 1)>
<6, (8, 13, -)>
<7, (3, 2, 17)>
<8, (4, 6, 12)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<10, (4, 15, -)>
<11, (3, 13, 15)>
<12, (5, 8, 3)>
<13, (11, 0, 16)>
<14, (1, -, -)>
<15, (11, 10, 17)>
<16, (18, 13, -)>
<17, (7, 15, -)>
<18, (19, 16, 1)>
<19, (9, 3, 18)>

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars found above. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].
