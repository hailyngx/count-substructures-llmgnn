Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star structures in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its neighbors:
   - Node 5 is the center with neighbors 9, 6, 2, 8, and 3.

2. For each neighbor of the central node, check if a 3-star structure is formed:
   - For node 9: <5, (9, 6, 4)>
   - For node 6: <5, (6, 9, 8)>
   - For node 2: <5, (2, 9, 7)>
   - For node 8: <5, (8, 6, 1)>
   - For node 3: No 3-star structure formed with node 5.

3. List the unique 3-star structures found:
   - <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (6, 9, 8)>, <5, (2, 9, 7)>, <5, (8, 6, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [4].
