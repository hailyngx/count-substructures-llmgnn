Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 3, 7)>
<7, (8, 3, 0)>
<7, (8, 3, 1)>
<7, (8, 3, 2)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 8, 3)>
<9, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 9, 3)>

So, there are a total of [12] 3-star structures in the given graph.
