Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for each node in the graph if it satisfies the criteria to be the center of a 3-star. Let's list the nodes that fulfill this condition and count the total number of 3-stars at the end.

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes are:
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 5, 0, and 21, forms a 3-star (<19, (5, 0, 21)>).
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 15, forms a 3-star (<6, (2, 15, 25)>).
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 27, 26, and 11, forms a 3-star (<1, (27, 26, 11)>).
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 23, 24, and forms a 3-star (<20, (23, 24, 28)>).
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 16, 24, and forms a 3-star (<28, (16, 24, 20)>).
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 19, 0, and forms a 3-star (<5, (19, 0, 21)>).
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 1, 10, and forms a 3-star (<26, (1, 11, 10)>).
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 21, and forms a 3-star (<0, (5, 19, 21)>).
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 17, 14, and 0, forms a 3-star (<21, (17, 14, 0)>).

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph, and the total number of 3-stars is [9].
