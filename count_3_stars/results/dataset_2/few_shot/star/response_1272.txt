Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. The possible 3-star configurations can be found among these nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 2, and 1
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 14, 11, and 4
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 10
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 13, 3, and 14
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 9, 3, and 1

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations for each of these central nodes:

<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<3, (14, 11, 4)>
<8, (1, 7, 10)>
<11, (13, 3, 14)>
<14, (9, 3, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-star graphs, we find a total of [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
