Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. For each node, identify all possible 3-stars it is part of:
    - Node 0: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 1: <1, (9, 11, 6)>
    - Node 2: <2, (6, 9, 4)>
    - Node 3: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
    - Node 5: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 6: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 7: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 8: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 2)>
    - Node 10: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 11: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 12: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 13: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).
    - Node 14: None (since it has less than 3 neighbors).

2. Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
    - <1, (9, 11, 6)>
    - <2, (6, 9, 4)>
    - <9, (6, 4, 2)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
