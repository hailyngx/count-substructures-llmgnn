Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0)

Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's define the notation for 3-stars as mentioned in the instruction and count them step by step:
- Node 0:
  - <0, (6, 7, 3)>
  - <0, (6, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (7, 5, 3)>

- Node 1:
  - <1, (3, 2, 5)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 8, 2)>
  - <1, (2, 8, 5)>

- Node 2:
  - <2, (9, 7, 1)>
  - <2, (9, 7, 5)>
  - <2, (1, 7, 5)>

- Node 3:
  - <3, (4, 7, 1)>
  - <3, (4, 7, 5)>
  - <3, (1, 7, 5)>
  
- Node 4:
  - <4, (9, 7, 5)>
  - <4, (9, 7, 3)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 3)>

- Node 5:
  - <5, (4, 7, 1)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 3)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 3)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (7, 8, 3)>

- Node 6:
  - <6, (9, 8, 0)>
  - <6, (9, 8, 7)>
  - <6, (8, 7, 0)>

- Node 7:
  - <7, (4, 0, 3)>
  - <7, (4, 0, 5)>
  - <7, (3, 0, 5)>
  - <7, (3, 0, 2)>
  - <7, (0, 2, 5)>

- Node 8:
  - <8, (6, 9, 1)>
  - <8, (6, 9, 5)>
  - <8, (9, 5, 1)>

- Node 9:
  - <9, (6, 8, 4)>
  - <9, (6, 8, 2)>
  - <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
