Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (8, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
