Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by checking nodes that form a 3-star pattern around a central node. Let's go through the graph and find all the 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
