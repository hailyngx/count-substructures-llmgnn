Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to locate all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph using the adjacency information provided:

<11, (13, 16, 17)>
<16, (11, 26, 5)>
<5, (26, 24, 0)>
<9, (20, 29, 6)>
<3, (13, 4, 15)>
<15, (3, 17, 12)>
<1, (18)>
<21, (22, 14, 8)>
<22, (2, 7, 25)>
<23, (27, 10, 22)>
<8, (13, 29, 21)>
<10, (12, 18, 17)>
<17, (11, 27, 15)>
<26, (16, 27, 5)>
<28, (29, 12)>
<29, (6, 20, 8)>
<0, (7, 19, 6)>
<2, (20, 22, 12)>
<7, (0, 22, 8)>
<20, (2, 9, 29)>
<12, (2, 10, 28)>
<6, (29, 19, 14)>
<14, (24, 6, 21)>
<18, (24, 1, 10)>
<27, (8, 18, 23)>
<19, (0, 6)>
<25, (22, 4)>
<24, (18, 5, 14)>
<4, (25, 3)>

There are **30** unique 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is **[30]**.
