Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the central node for each potential 3-star. This will be the node with exactly 3 edges connecting to it.
2. For each central node, determine the number of 3-stars it is a part of by looking at its neighbors.
3. List the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's go through each step:

1. Central nodes with exactly 3 edges connecting to them:
   - Node 1
   - Node 3

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
   - The only 3-star with Node 1 as the central node is <1, (2, 6, 9)>.

3. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
   - The only 3-star with Node 3 as the central node is <3, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
