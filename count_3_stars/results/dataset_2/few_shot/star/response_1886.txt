Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node's connections to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (9, 16, 24)> and <0, (9, 16, 5)>
- Node 1: <1, (29, 22, 23)>
- Node 2: <2, (29, 22, 26)>
- Node 3: <3, (16, 26, 22)>
- Node 4: <4, (25, 9, 21)> and <4, (25, 9, 14)>
- Node 5: <5, (15, 0, 26)>
- Node 7: <7, (25, 20, 24)> and <7, (25, 20, 27)>
- Node 9: <9, (8, 4, 27)> and <9, (8, 0, 27)>
- Node 10: <10, (19, 20, 14)>
- Node 12: <12, (8, 13, 18)>
- Node 14: <14, (4, 10, 21)>
- Node 15: <15, (5, 29, 20)>
- Node 16: <16, (3, 28, 23)>
- Node 20: <20, (7, 5, 10)>
- Node 21: <21, (2, 19, 14)> and <21, (11, 19, 21)>
- Node 22: <22, (2, 29, 1)>
- Node 24: <24, (7, 0, 11)>
- Node 25: <25, (4, 7, 27)>
- Node 26: <26, (3, 2, 5)>
- Node 27: <27, (9, 7, 27)>
- Node 28: <28, (16, 17, 23)>
- Node 29: <29, (1, 15, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
