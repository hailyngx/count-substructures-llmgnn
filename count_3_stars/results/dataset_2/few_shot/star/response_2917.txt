Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Find the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

2. Identify the 3-stars:

- From the adjacency list, we see that node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 1, 3, and 6.
  - (0, 5, 4, 1)
  - (0, 5, 3, 1)
  - (0, 5, 1, 3)
  - (0, 5, 1, 8)
  - (0, 4, 2, 6)
  - (0, 4, 6, 2)
  - (0, 1, 3, 8)
  - (0, 1, 8, 5)
  
- Other possible combinations can be inferred from symmetry.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:

- <0, (5, 4, 1)>
- <0, (5, 3, 1)>
- <0, (5, 1, 3)>
- <0, (5, 1, 8)>
- <0, (4, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 8, 5)>

[The total number of unique 3-stars is 7.]
