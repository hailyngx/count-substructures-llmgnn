Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0)

Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step.

The nodes that are part of a 3-star should be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 4)>
  
There are no other nodes in the graph that satisfy the conditions to be part of a 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
