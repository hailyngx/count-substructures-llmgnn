Response:
As a first step, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can list down all the 3-stars, keeping in mind that a 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it:
1. <0, (6, 8, 5)> (Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 5)
2. <1, (10, 11, 14)> (Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 14)
3. <2, (7, 9, 12)> (Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 12)
4. <3, (9, 8, 5)> (Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 5)
5. <4, (7, 9, 12)> (Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 12)
6. <5, (7, 6, 0)> (Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 0)
7. <6, (9, 5, 13)> (Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 13)
8. <7, (4, 12, 2)> (Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 2)
9. <8, (10, 3, 0)> (Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 0)
10. <9, (4, 6, 2)> (Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 2)
11. <10, (8, 13, 11)> (Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 11)
12. <11, (10, 1, 12)> (Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 1, and 12)
13. <12, (4, 7, 13)> (Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 13)
14. <13, (6, 12, 10)> (Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 10)
15. <14, (4, 5, 0)> (Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 0)

There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [15].
