Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
