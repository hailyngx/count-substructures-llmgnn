Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by examining each node and finding how many 3-stars it participates in. A 3-star is formed around a node when that node is the center of the star connected by edges to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the graph, we find that there are three unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
