Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 14, 10)>
<0, (9, 14, 15)>
<0, (10, 14, 15)>
<3, (5, 7, 18)>
<3, (7, 9, 18)>
<3, (7, 10, 12)>
<3, (12, 10, 6)>
<4, (6, 10, 12)>
<8, (7, 15, 16)>
<8, (15, 16, 17)>
<13, (15, 19, 13)>
<14, (6, 17, 10)>
<15, (0, 13, 15)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
