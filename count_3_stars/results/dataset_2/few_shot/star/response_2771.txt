Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all possible combinations of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 1, 18)>
2. <0, (3, 1, 19)>
3. <0, (3, 19, 6)>
4. <0, (1, 3, 19)>
5. <0, (1, 18, 19)>
6. <1, (8, 0, 3)>
7. <2, (8, 7, 15)>
8. <3, (5, 0, 8)>
9. <3, (4, 0, 8)>
10. <3, (5, 8, 4)>
11. <4, (12, 3, 8)>
12. <8, (2, 7, 12)>
13. <8, (7, 15, 2)>
14. <8, (12, 4, 3)>
15. <12, (18, 4, 8)>
16. <14, (11, 16, 13)>
17. <14, (16, 10, 13)>
18. <14, (11, 13, 10)>
19. <14, (16, 13, 10)>
20. <16, (19, 14, 10)>
21. <16, (19, 14, 13)>
22. <17, (15, 18, 17)>
23. <18, (0, 12, 17)>
24. <18, (0, 1, 3)>
25. <18, (0, 17, 12)>
26. <19, (0, 13, 16)>
27. <19, (0, 16, 13)>
28. <19, (10, 13, 16)>
29. <19, (10, 14, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
