Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges.

By examining the adjacency list provided, we find that the nodes 0, 2, and 5 each have edges to exactly 3 other nodes, making them potential centers for 3-stars.

Let's now find all unique 3-stars in the graph with each potential center:
<0, (4, 7, 2)>
<0, (3, 6, 2)>
<0, (7, 0, 4)>

<2, (1, 3, 0)>
<2, (3, 9, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (8, 6, 5)>

<5, (4, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 6, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
