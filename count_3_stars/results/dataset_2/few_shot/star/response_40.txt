Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 12, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, 12, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 13, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 13, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 2, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 14, 5, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 10

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 14)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<0, (14, 12, 5)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<8, (9, 2, 14)>
<5, (0, 13, 10)>
<13, (6, 5, 3)>
<12, (8, 0, 3)>
<10, (4, 14, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have 13 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
