Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (4, 7, 1, 9, 5)
   - <0, (4, 7, 1)>
   - No 3-star with node 0 as the center node is present.

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (4, 7, 3, 5, 9, 0)
   - <1, (4, 7, 3)>
   - No 3-star with node 1 as the center node is present.

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (7, 3, 6, 5, 8)
   - <2, (7, 3, 5)>
   - No 3-star with node 2 as the center node is present.

4. Nodes connected to node 3: (4, 1, 2)
   - <3, (4, 1, 2)>
   - No 3-star with node 3 as the center node is present.

5. Nodes connected to node 4: (7, 0, 1, 6, 3)
   - <4, (7, 0, 6)>
   - No 3-star with node 4 as the center node is present.

6. Nodes connected to node 5: (1, 2, 0)
   - <5, (1, 2, 0)>
   - No 3-star with node 5 as the center node is present.

7. Nodes connected to node 6: (4, 2, 8)
   - <6, (4, 2, 8)>
   - No 3-star with node 6 as the center node is present.

8. Nodes connected to node 7: (4, 0, 2, 8, 1)
   - <7, (4, 0, 2)>
   - No 3-star with node 7 as the center node is present.

9. Nodes connected to node 8: (7, 6, 2)
   - <8, (7, 6, 2)>
   - No 3-star with node 8 as the center node is present.

10. Nodes connected to node 9: (1, 0)
   - <9, (1, 0, 0)>
   - No 3-star with node 9 as the center node is present.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
