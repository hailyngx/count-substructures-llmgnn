Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 15.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12 and 3.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 16 and 18.
- Node 16 is connected to one node only, which doesn't meet the criteria.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 3.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 2.

Now we have identified the potential centers for 3-stars. Let's analyze the possible 3-stars with the found centers:

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (4, 15, 8)>
  
2. Node 1: 
    - <1, (13, 6, 17)>
  
3. Node 2:
    - <2, (8, 9, 19)>
  
4. Node 5:
    - <5, (12, 3, 13)>

5. Node 10:
    - <10, (16, 18, 19)>
  
6. Node 18:
    - <18, (17, 10, 3)>
  
7. Node 19:
    - <19, (4, 10, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph:
