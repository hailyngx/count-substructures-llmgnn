Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: 
   - <0, (9, 4, 1)>
   - <0, (9, 8, 2)>
   - <0, (4, 1, 8)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 2)>

2. Node 1: 
   - <1, (5, 3, 0)>
   - <1, (5, 2, 0)>
   - <1, (3, 2, 5)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (6, 3, 1)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 0)>
   - <2, (6, 1, 3)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 1, 2)>
   - <3, (5, 2, 6)>

5. Node 4: 
   - <4, (7, 8, 0)>
   
6. Node 5:
   - <5, (6, 3, 1)>
   - <5, (6, 1, 2)>

7. Node 6: 
   - <6, (5, 1, 3)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 2)>
   - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (9, 6, 8)>
   
9. Node 8:
   - <8, (9, 4, 7)>
   
10. Node 9:
    - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
   
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15].
