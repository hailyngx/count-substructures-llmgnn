Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

1. 3-star with node 5 as the central node and nodes 1, 17, and 14 as the leaves. <5, (1, 17, 14)>
2. 3-star with node 17 as the central node and nodes 16, 7, and 19 as the leaves. <17, (16, 7, 19)>
3. 3-star with node 18 as the central node and nodes 8, 10, and 12 as the leaves. <18, (8, 10, 12)>
4. 3-star with node 16 as the central node and nodes 11, 17, and 18 as the leaves. <16, (11, 17, 18)>
5. 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 3, 4, and 6 as the leaves. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
6. 3-star with node 19 as the central node and nodes 7, 17, and 9 as the leaves. <19, (7, 17, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Count of 3-stars: [6]
