Response:
As a first step, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<5, (4, 10, 19)>
<8, (4, 10, 11)>
<10, (5, 8, 13)>
<11, (9, 8, 7)>
<12, (4, 19, 15)>
<13, (4, 10, 17)>
<14, (0, 19, 14)>
<15, (12, 18, 2)>
<18, (0, 3, 15)>
<19, (5, 9, 14)>

Now, we will count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
After counting, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
