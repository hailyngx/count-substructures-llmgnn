Response:
Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 13, 16)>
<1, (9, 10, 18)>
<2, (26, 10, 25)>
<3, (29, 12, 17)>
<4, (9, 16, 22)>
<5, (12, 24, 5)>
<6, (9)>
<7, (0, 19, 29)>
<8, (23, 14, 11)>
<9, (6, 4, 16)>
<10, (18, 1, 24)>
<11, (27, 22, 25)>
<12, (18, 3, 5)>
<13, (9, 18, 0)>
