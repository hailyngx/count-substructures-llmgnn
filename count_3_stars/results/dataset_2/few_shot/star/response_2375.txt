Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Given the adjacency list for each node, we can start by looking at each node and its neighbors to find all the 3-stars. 

1. For Node 0:
    <0, (4, 2, 6)> 

2. For Node 1:
    No 3-stars.

3. For Node 2:
    <2, (4, 0, 6)>

4. For Node 3:
    No 3-stars.

5. For Node 4:
    <4, (5, 1, 0)>
    <4, (5, 7, 2)>
    
6. For Node 5:
    <5, (9, 8, 4)>

7. For Node 6:
    No 3-stars.

8. For Node 7:
    <7, (5, 8, 4)>
    
9. For Node 8:
    <8, (5, 9, 7)>
    
10. For Node 9:
    <9, (5, 8, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, (4, 2, 6)>, <2, (4, 0, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>.
