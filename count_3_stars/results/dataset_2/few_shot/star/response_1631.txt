Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 10)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (7, 5, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 10, 14)>
<5, (1, 2, 10)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<7, (2, 12, 3)>
<8, (9, 12, 14)>
<9, (8, 13, 14)>
<10, (0, 1, 4)>
<11, (12, 14, 5)>
<12, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (9, 12)>
<14, (8, 11, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
