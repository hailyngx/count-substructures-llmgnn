Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:
1. Start by identifying nodes that are the centers of potential 3-stars. These are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Node 3, Node 8, Node 12, and Node 17 meet this criterion.

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.
   
   For Node 3:
   - (3, 19, 17) forms a 3-star with Node 3 as the center.
   - <3, (19, 17, 8)>

   For Node 8:
   - (8, 14, 11) forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.
   - (8, 14, 16) forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.
   - (8, 11, 3) forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.
   - (8, 11, 18) forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.
   - <8, (14, 11, 16)>, <8, (14, 11, 3)>, <8, (11, 18, 3)>, <8, (14, 16, 3)>

   For Node 12:
   - (12, 0, 15) forms a 3-star with Node 12 as the center.
   - (12, 2, 5) forms a 3-star with Node 12 as the center.
   - (12, 13, 18) forms a 3-star with Node 12 as the center.
   - <12, (0, 15, 9)>, <12, (2, 5, 7)>, <12, (13, 18, 15)>

   For Node 17:
   - (17, 6, 16) forms a 3-star with Node 17 as the center.
   - (17, 9, 18) forms a 3-star with Node 17 as the center.
   - (17, 19, 3) forms a 3-star with Node 17 as the center.
   - <17, (6, 16, 4)>, <17, (9, 18, 13)>, <17, (19, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<<3, (19, 17, 8)>, <8, (14, 11, 16)>, <8, (14, 11, 3)>, <8, (11, 18, 3)>, <8, (14, 16, 3)>, <12, (0, 15, 9)>, <12, (2, 5, 7)>, <12, (13, 18, 15)>, <17, (6, 16, 4)>, <17, (9, 18, 13)>, <17, (19, 3, 8)>>

Count of unique 3-stars: [11]
