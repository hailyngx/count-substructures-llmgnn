Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs within the given graph:
1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes with less than 3 connections cannot be part of any 3-star graph.
2. For nodes with 3 connections, there may be 3-star graphs where that node is the center.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (21, 12, 20)>
<1, (17, 8, 13)>
<2, (26, 24, 29)>
<3, (22, 27, 16)>
<5, (9, 24, 15)>
<6, (18, 23, 26)>
<10, (22, 24, 20)>
<11, (21, 12, 25)>
<13, (9, 17, 19)>
<15, (5, 26, 15)>
<16, (17, 26, 3)>
<18, (22, 23, 6)>
<29, (22, 0, 26)>
<29, (28, 0, 26)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star graphs: [14]
