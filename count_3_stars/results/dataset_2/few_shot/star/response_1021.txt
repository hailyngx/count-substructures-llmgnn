Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, identify the 3-stars connected to it:
   - For Node 0: (0, 9, 4, 7), (0, 10, 1, 3), (0, 13, 9, 11)
   - For Node 1: (1, 6, 5, 9), (1, 3, 10, 4)
   - For Node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one other node.
   - For Node 3: (3, 9, 5, 6), (3, 1, 10, 0), (3, 14, 2, 8), (3, 12, 5, 6)
   - For Node 4: (4, 9, 6, 5), (4, 7, 0, 9), (4, 10, 1, 9), (4, 11, 13, 14)
   - For Node 5: (5, 9, 6, 12), (5, 6, 1, 9), (5, 8, 14, 12)
   - For Node 6: (6, 5, 9, 3), (6, 1, 10, 12)
   - For Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one other node.
   - For Node 8: (8, 5, 14, 12), (8, 12, 3, 5)
   - For Node 9: (9, 5, 8, 12), (9, 6, 5, 11), (9, 4, 7, 0)
   - For Node 10: (10, 1, 3, 4), (10, 0, 13, 9)
   - For Node 11: (11, 5, 9, 13)
   - For Node 12: (12, 5, 8, 14)
   - For Node 13: (13, 9, 0, 4), (13, 11, 5, 9)
   - For Node 14: (14, 3, 12, 8), (14, 2, 1, 3)

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (10, 1, 3)>, <0, (13, 9, 11)>
   - <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 10, 4)>
   - <3, (9, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 10, 0)>, <3, (14, 2, 8)>, <3, (12, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (9, 6, 5)>, <4, (7, 0, 9)>, <4, (10, 1, 9)>, <4, (11, 13, 14)>
   - <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (6, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 14, 12)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (1, 10, 12)>
   - <8, (5, 14, 12)>, <8, (12, 3, 5)>
   - <9, (5, 8, 12)>, <9, (6, 5, 11)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>
   - <10, (1, 3, 4)>, <10, (0, 13, 9)>
   - <11, (5, 9, 13)>
   - <12, (5, 8, 14)>
   - <13, (9, 0, 4)>, <13, (11, 5, 9)>
   - <14, (3, 12, 8)>, <14, (2, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
