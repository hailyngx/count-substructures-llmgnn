Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star based on the definition provided. 

Here is how we can find the 3-stars:
- Look for nodes that have exactly three incident edges.
- For each such node, check if the nodes at the other end of those edges form a 3-star with this node at the center.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 10, 6)>
<1, (8, 7, 12)>
<2, (5, 8, 13)>
<4, (3, 11, 6)>
<5, (3, 10, 13)>
<9, (3, 11, 12)>
<14, (11, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
