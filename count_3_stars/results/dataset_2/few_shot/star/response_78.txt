Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's first find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.

Now, we can find all the unique 3-stars that can be formed by choosing one of these nodes as the center. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

As we have found four unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
