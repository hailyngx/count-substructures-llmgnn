Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph, we need to identify every pair of nodes that share a common neighbor.

Here are the unique 3-star structures in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
