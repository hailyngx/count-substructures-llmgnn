Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 11 with neighbors 16, 28, 3 forms a 3-star: <11, (16, 28, 3)>
2. Node 11 with neighbors 26, 29, 3 forms a 3-star: <11, (26, 29, 3)>
3. Node 16 with neighbors 22, 19, 11 forms a 3-star: <16, (22, 19, 11)>
4. Node 29 with neighbors 13, 5, 11 forms a 3-star: <29, (13, 5, 11)>
5. Node 7 with neighbors 21, 18, 8 forms a 3-star: <7, (21, 18, 8)>
6. Node 4 with neighbors 18, 3, 8 forms a 3-star: <4, (18, 3, 8)>
7. Node 2 with neighbors 8, 10, 17 forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 10, 17)>
8. Node 5 with neighbors 19, 17, 22 forms a 3-star: <5, (19, 17, 22)>
9. Node 9 with neighbors 27, 12, 23 forms a 3-star: <9, (27, 12, 23)>
10. Node 10 with neighbors 13, 21, 23 forms a 3-star: <10, (13, 21, 23)>
11 The number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
