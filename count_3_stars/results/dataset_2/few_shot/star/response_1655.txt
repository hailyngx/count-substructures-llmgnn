Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Central nodes are nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the central nodes:
Central nodes: 9, 10, 12

Now, let's find the 3-stars for each central node:

For central node 9:
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

For central node 10:
<10, (4, 8, 14)>
<10, (4, 8, 7)>
<10, (14, 8, 7)>

For central node 12:
<12, (11, 13, 2)>
<12, (11, 1, 2)>

Now, combining all unique 3-stars:
[<9, (6, 8, 14)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <10, (4, 8, 14)>, <10, (4, 8, 7)>, <10, (14, 8, 7)>, <12, (11, 13, 2)>, <12, (11, 1, 2)>]
