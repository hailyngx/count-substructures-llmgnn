Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes are connected in a way that form a 3-star:
<1, (6, 17, 12)>  
<4, (8, 5, 2)>  
<6, (5, 1, 17)>  
<12, (1, 17, 16)>  
<13, (3, 11, 10)>  
<14, (1, 16, 3)>  
<15, (14, 9, 18)>  
<16, (12, 14, 16)>  
<17, (6, 1, 18)>  

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found.
