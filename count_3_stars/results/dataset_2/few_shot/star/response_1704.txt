Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern with it as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- <2, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (9, 1, 2)>
- <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 2, 1)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 0, 6)>
- <8, (4, 7, 6)>
- <9, (5, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
