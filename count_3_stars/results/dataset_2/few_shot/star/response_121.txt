7. Node 6: (8, 11, 6), (8, 7, 6), (8, 6, 1), (11, 6, 7), (11, 0, 6), (0, 6, 7)
8. Node 7: (0, 9, 7), (0, 7, 6), (9, 7, 1)
9. Node 8: (13, 4, 8), (13, 0, 8), (4, 9, 8), (9, 8, 6)
10. Node 9: (8, 4, 9), (8, 3, 9), (8, 9, 1), (4, 9, 12), (4, 5, 9), (9, 7, 1)
11. Node 10: (0, 2, 10), (2, 10, 14), (0, 10, 14)
