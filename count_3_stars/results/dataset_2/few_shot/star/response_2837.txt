Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph: 

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars based on the central node and connected nodes. 

2. Count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star. 

Now, let's find the 3-star patterns:

<0, (9, 19, 16)>
<1, (13, 15, 7)>
<2, (8, 10, 19)>
<3, (9, 13)>
<4, (5, 18, 12)>
<5, (11, 4, 16)>
<6, (17, 16)>
<7, (1, 5)>
<8, (9, 14, 13)>
<9, (8, 14, 3)>
<10, (12, 18, 2)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<14, (9, 17, 8)>
<15, (13, 1, 16)>

Finally, counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [14].
