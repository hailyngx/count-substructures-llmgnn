Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify all the 3-stars by finding all nodes with exactly three edges and then confirming if those three edges form a 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:
   - Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8 have exactly three edges each.

2. Check if the edges from these nodes form 3-stars:
   - Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 2), and (3, 1)
     <1, (3, 2, 1)>
   
   - Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 12), and (4, 14)
     <4, (8, 12, 14)>
   
   - Node 6: (6, 14), (6, 10), and (6, 13)
     <6, (14, 10, 13)>
   
   - Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 4), and (8, 2)
     <8, (11, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 2, 1)>, <4, (8, 12, 14)>, <6, (14, 10, 13)>, <8, (11, 4, 2)>.
