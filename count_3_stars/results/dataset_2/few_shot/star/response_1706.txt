Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will form 3-stars with the central node being the node itself. 

Here are the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 5, and 2.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 23, 5, and 18.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 28, and 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 19.

Therefore, there are four 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<13, (22, 5, 2)>
<15, (23, 5, 18)>
<26, (1, 28, 14)>
<27, (1, 3, 19)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
