Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. From the adjacency list, we have:
   - Node 7 is connected to 4, 16, and 28.
   - Node 11 is connected to 10, 23, and 9.
   - Node 13 is connected to 7, 29, and 18.
   - Node 19 is connected to 10, 2, and 24.
   - Node 28 is connected to 15, 7, and 16.
   - Node 29 is connected to 8, 21, and 18.

2. Formulate the 3-stars based on the identified centers:
   - <7, (4, 16, 28)>
   - <11, (10, 23, 9)>
   - <13, (7, 29, 18)>
   - <19, (10, 2, 24)>
   - <28, (15, 7, 16)>
   - <29, (8, 21, 18)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph as shown above.
