Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is a 3-star center with leaves 5, 10, 1
- Node 1 is a 3-star center with leaves 15, 18, 0
- Node 2 is a 3-star center with leaves 5, 8, 19
- Node 3 is a 3-star center with leaves 15, 7, 13
- Node 7 is a 3-star center with leaves 11, 3, 10
- Node 12 is a 3-star center with leaves 11, 5, 18
- Node 13 is a 3-star center with leaves 3, 17, 19
- Node 14 is a 3-star center with leaves 18, 10, 16
- Node 15 is a 3-star center with leaves 3, 1, 5
- Node 17 is a 3-star center with leaves 5, 4, 8
- Node 19 is a 3-star center with leaves 9, 2, 13

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 10, 1)>
<1, (15, 18, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 19)>
<3, (15, 7, 13)>
<7, (11, 3, 10)>
<12, (11, 5, 18)>
<13, (3, 17, 19)>
<14, (18, 10, 16)>
<15, (3, 1, 5)>
<17, (5, 4, 8)>
<19, (9, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
