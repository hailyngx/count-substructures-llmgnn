Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes that have exactly 3 connected nodes. These central nodes will form the center of the 3-stars.

The central nodes with 3 connected nodes are: 10, 11, 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 1, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars for each central node:
- For central node 10: <10, (11, 18, 2)>
- For central node 11: <11, (10, 18, 9)>
- For central node 2: <2, (10, 6, 15)>
- For central node 5: <5, (6, 13, 17)>
- For central node 6: <6, (5, 18, 12)>
- For central node 9: <9, (11, 13, 14)>
- For central node 12: <12, (11, 6, 15)>
- For central node 14: <14, (4, 9, 1)>
- For central node 1: <1, (17, 15, 14)>
- For central node 15: <15, (2, 1, 12)>
- For central node 16: <16, (5, 0, 7)>
- For central node 17: <17, (5, 8, 13)>
- For central node 18: <18, (10, 11, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find there are 13 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
