Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Node 0: connected to nodes 14, 4, and 10
    - Node 1: connected to nodes 17, 16, and 10
    - Node 4: connected to nodes 18, 0, and 16
    - Node 5: connected to nodes 17, 6, and 11
    - Node 9: connected to nodes 14, 12, and 15
    - Node 13: connected to nodes 14, 18, and 10
    - Node 15: connected to nodes 9, 19, and 13
    - Node 18: connected to nodes 2, 4, and 13

Step 2: For each of these nodes identified in Step 1, check if they are the central node of a 3-star configuration.
    - For Node 0: <0, (14, 4, 10)>
    - For Node 1: <1, (17, 16, 10)>
    - For Node 4: <4, (18, 0, 16)>
    - For Node 5: <5, (17, 6, 11)>
    - For Node 9: <9, (14, 12, 15)>
    - For Node 13: <13, (14, 18, 10)>
    - For Node 15: <15, (9, 19, 13)>
    - For Node 18: <18, (2, 4, 13)>

Step 3: Identify the unique 3-stars found in Step 2.
    - <0, (14, 4, 10)>
    - <1, (17, 16, 10)>
    - <4, (18, 0, 16)>
    - <5, (17, 6, 11)>
    - <9, (14, 12, 15)>
    - <13, (14, 18, 10)>
    - <15, (9, 19, 13)>
    - <18, (2, 4, 13)>
