Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by locating nodes that are directly connected in the form of a star centered at a specific node.

Given the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 0, 10)>
<10, (3, 17, 2)>
<17, (10, 11, 7)>
<2, (10, 8, 11)>
<8, (2, 16, 11)>
<5, (1, 13, 15)>
<0, (3, 15, 4)>
<7, (17, 18, 11)>
<4, (0, 12, 15)>
<12, (10, 4, 14)>
<9, (1, 18, -)>
<6, (11, 19, -)>
<13, (5, 11, -)>
<14, (12, 19, 16)>
<15, (5, 0, 4)>
<16, (8, 14, 19)>
<11, (17, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above.
