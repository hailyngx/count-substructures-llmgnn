Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are: 
- <4, (7, 10, 11)>
- <4, (7, 10, 12)>
- <4, (6, 10, 11)>
- <7, (1, 10, 13)>
- <7, (1, 10, 11)>
- <7, (1, 13, 10)>
- <2, (0, 3, 14)>
- <2, (0, 3, 10)>
- <2, (5, 3, 14)>
- <2, (5, 3, 10)>
- <2, (5, 12, 14)>
- <2, (5, 12, 10)>
- <2, (12, 5, 14)>
- <2, (12, 5, 10)>
- <5, (2, 12, 14)>
- <5, (2, 12, 10)>
- <5, (6, 12, 14)>
- <5, (6, 12, 10)>
- <5, (14, 2, 1)>
- <5, (14, 2, 3)>
- <5, (14, 2, 10)>
- <5, (14, 3, 2)>
- <5, (14, 3, 1)>
- <5, (14, 3, 10)>
- <1, (7, 10, 13)>
- <1, (7, 10, 11)>
- <1, (7, 13, 10)>
- <3, (6, 2, 14)>
- <3, (6, 2, 10)>
- <3, (14, 2, 1)>
- <3, (14, 2, 5)>
- <3, (14, 2, 10)>
- <3, (14, 5, 1)>
- <3, (14, 5, 2)>
- <3, (14, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
