Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 22
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 19
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 23, and 8
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 21, and 0
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 29
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 13, and 0
   - Node 20 is connected to nodes 22, 11, and 16
   - Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 16
   - Node 24 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 13
   - Node 28 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 25

2. Group the identified 3-stars:
   - <3, (15, 10, 22)>
   - <15, (3, 10, 19)>
   - <7, (15, 23, 8)>
   - <12, (10, 21, 0)>
   - <18, (4, 14, 29)>
   - <19, (15, 13, 0)>
   - <20, (22, 11, 16)>
   - <21, (5, 12, 16)>
   - <24, (9, 1, 13)>
   - <28, (11, 8, 25)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
