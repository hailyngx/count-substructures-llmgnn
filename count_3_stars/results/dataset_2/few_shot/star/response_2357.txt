Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<3, (9, 4)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
