Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes connected to a central node. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<5, (13, 15, 22)>
<6, (1, 21, 27)>
<9, (14, 15, 29)>
<15, (5, 25, 29)>
<16, (4, 23, 24)>
<18, (4, 12, 28)>
<19, (8, 27, 29)>
<20, (7, 12, 18)>
<21, (6, 24, 25)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. We have found 9 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
