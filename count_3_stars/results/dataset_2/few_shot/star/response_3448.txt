Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For each node, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. If it does, then it is the center of a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list given, the nodes along with their neighbors which form 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 9, 17)>
- <3, (1, 5, 14)>
- <5, (3, 11, 19)>
- <7, (10, 13, 18)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <13, (7, 9, 17)>
- <18, (7, 16, 8)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 16)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <16, (0, 15, 18)>
- <15, (5, 16, )>

Count of 3-stars is the number of unique triples above: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
