Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (10, 17, 13)>
<1, (10, 18, 15)>
<2, (18, 19, 11)>
<3, (4, 11, 5)>
<4, (8, 3, 11)>
<6, (17, 15, 12)>
<7, (16, 14, 9)>
<13, (7, 16, 19)>
<16, (18, 7, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
