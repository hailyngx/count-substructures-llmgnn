Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Considering the definition of a 3-star, we will look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes and count how many such configurations exist in the graph. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (8, 2, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
