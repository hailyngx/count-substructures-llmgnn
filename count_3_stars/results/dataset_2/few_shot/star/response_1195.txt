Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star by verifying if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If a node is the center of a 3-star, list the three connected nodes as leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (10, 11, 7)>
<1, (10, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 13, 7)>
<3, (9, 13, 0)>
<4, (6, 9, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<7, (11, 0, 2)>
<8, (9, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<10, (0, 12, 8)>
<11, (7, 0, 2)>
<12, (10, 4, 5)>
<13, (6, 8, 2)>
<14, (4, 1, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
