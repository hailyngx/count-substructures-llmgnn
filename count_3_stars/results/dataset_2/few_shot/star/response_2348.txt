Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 8), (9, 11), and (9, 10). This forms the 3-star <9, (8, 11, 10)>.

Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 2), (1, 13), and (1, 4). This forms the 3-star <1, (2, 13, 4)>.

Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 14), (3, 8), (3, 4). This forms the 3-star <3, (14, 8, 4)>.

Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7). This forms the 3-star <4, (1, 3, 7)>.

Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 11). This forms the 3-star <7, (4, 0, 11)>.

Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 0). This forms the 3-star <8, (9, 3, 0)>.

Node 13 has 3 edges: (13, 9), (13, 1), (13, 4). This forms the 3-star <13, (9, 1, 4)>.

Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 0). This forms the 3-star <2, (1, 7, 0)>.

Now counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are 7 unique 3-stars as listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
