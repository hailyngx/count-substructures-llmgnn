Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Based on the edge information and adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<1, (6, 28, 23)>
<6, (1, 14, 23)>
<9, (22, 12, 26)>
<14, (6, 17, 11)>
<13, (21, 8, 5)>
<2, (17, 16, 27)>
<8, (13, 10, 29)>
<12, (9, 8, 22)>
<17, (14, 25, 2)>
<18, (10, 29, 8)>
<23, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (13, 3, 19)>
<5, (13, 22, 10)>
<21, (24, 13, 29)>
<22, (9, 26, 5)>
<26, (6, 22, 28)>
<27, (7, 24, 4)>
<29, (21, 8, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
