Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 14, 2, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, 5, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars first. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 14, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 13)>
<4, (9, 7, 5)>
<5, (7, 2, 11)>
<6, (1, 10, 13)>
<7, (9, 1, 4)>
<8, (3, 8, 4)>
<9, (4, 7, 14)>
<10, (6, 2, 13)>
<11, (4, 0, 5)>
<12, (3, 4, 10)>
<13, (3, 7, 14)>
<14, (7, 0, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The total number of unique 3-stars: [15]
