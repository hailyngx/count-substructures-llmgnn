Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars. Then we can count how many instances of each unique 3-star exist. 

In this graph, the 3-stars can be represented by the combination of a central node and its three connected nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of instances of each unique 3-star:
- The 3-star <0, (4, 7, 9)> appears 1 time.
- The 3-star <1, (4, 6, 8)> appears 1 time.
- The 3-star <2, (4, 5, 6)> appears 1 time.
- The 3-star <3, (5, 6, 8)> appears 1 time.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
