Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. A 3-star consists of one central node connected to exactly three leaves. 

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
Node 9: No 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
