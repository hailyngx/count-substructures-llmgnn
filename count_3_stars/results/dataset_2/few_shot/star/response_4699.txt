Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph.

1. Identify all possible 3-stars:
   - For each node, check its neighbors. If there are exactly three neighbors, a 3-star configuration is formed.

2. Count the number of unique 3-star configurations.

Here are the unique 3-star configurations:
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<15, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 16, 17)>
<17, (2, 7, 10)>
<10, (3, 14, 17)>
<11, (7, 12, 13)>
<0, (5, 12, 19)>
<16, (1, 9, 19)>
<14, (6, 10, 14)>
<1, (12, 16, 19)>
<12, (0, 1, 11)>

Count: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
