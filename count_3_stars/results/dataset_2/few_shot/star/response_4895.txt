Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of unique 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (8, 5, 10)>
<1, (4, 17, 18)>
<2, (7, 13, 3)>
<3, (17, 14, 2)>
<4, (16, 7, 14)>
<5, (8, 0, 5)>
<6, (16, 15, 6)>
<7, (4, 10, 9)>
<8, (19, 5, 15)>
<9, (7, 17, 19)>
<10, (0, 7, 12)>
<11, (16, 18, 11)>
<12, (0, 10, 12)>
<13, (2, 13)>
<14, (16, 4, 3)>
<15, (8, 19, 15)>
<16, (11, 4, 6)>
<17, (1, 3, 9)>
<18, (11, 1, 17)>

By listing the unique 3-stars found above, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
