Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at each node and checking how many 3-stars that node is part of. Let's go step by step to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (10, 5, 13)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 20, 19)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2: <2, (22, 10, 25)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars.
6. Node 5: <5, (14, 22, 15)> and <5, (14, 27, 22)> are 3-stars.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars.
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 16, 1)> is a 3-star.
11. Node 10: No 3-stars.
12. Node 11: No 3-stars.
13. Node 12: No 3-stars.
14. Node 13: No 3-stars.
15. Node 14: No 3-stars.
16. Node 15: No 3-stars.
17. Node 16: No 3-stars.
18. Node 17: No 3-stars.
19. Node 18: No 3-stars.
20. Node 19: No 3-stars.
21. Node 20: <20, (1, 28, 17)> is a 3-star.
22. Node 21: No 3-stars.
23. Node 22: No 3-stars.
24. Node 23: No connections.
25. Node 24: No 3-stars.
26. Node 25: No 3-stars.
27. Node 26: No 3-stars.
28. Node 27: No 3-stars.
29. Node 28: No 3-stars.
30. Node 29: No 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (10, 5, 13)>, <1, (9, 20, 19)>, <2, (22, 10, 25)>, <5, (14, 22, 15)>, <5, (14, 27, 22)>, <9, (6, 16, 1)>, <20, (1, 28, 17)>.

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
