Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 8, 1, 5, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 8, 6, and node 2

Node 6 is connected to node 10, 4, 2, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 10, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 12, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 10, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 6, 7, 13, 9, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 14, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 14, 6, and node 0

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be identified by counting the number of 3-star patterns. 

Let's find all the 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. <0, (11, 8, 1)>
2. <0, (11, 5, 13)>
3. <1, (11, 8, 9)>
4. <2, (4, 6, 14)>
5. <3, (11, 14, 5)>
6. <4, (11, 8, 6)>
7. <5, (10, 8, 7)>
8. <6, (10, 4, 2)>
9. <7, (10, 5, None)>
10. <8, (4, 5, 0)>
11. <9, (10, 1, None)>
12. <10, (11, 6, 13)>
13. <11, (10, 3, 14)>
14. <12, (8, None, None)>
15. <13, (10, 14, 6)>
16. <14, (11, 13, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
