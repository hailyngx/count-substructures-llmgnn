Response:
First, let's count how many 3-stars are possible in the given graph.

Since each 3-star is centered at one of the nodes, we need to go through each node and see how many 3-stars can be formed with it at the center.

### Node 0:
- <0, (7, 4, 5)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 1:
- <1, (14, 4, 7)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 2:
- <2, (19, 4, 10)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 3:
- <3, (18, 13, 5)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 4:
- <4, (10, 0, 2)>
- <4, (1, 12, 14)>
- Total 3-stars: 2

### Node 5:
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 6:
- <6, (17, 8, 18)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 7:
- <7, (0, 13, 18)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 8:
- <8, (17, 6, 12)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 9:
- <9, (14, 11, 15)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 10:
- <10, (4, 19, 2)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 11:
- <11, (9, 8, 12)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 12:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 12 as the center.

### Node 13:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 13 as the center.

### Node 14:
- <14, (17, 9, 1)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 15:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 15 as the center.

### Node 16:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 16 as the center.

### Node 17:
- <17, (14, 6, 8)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 18:
- <18, (7, 6, 3)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

### Node 19:
- <19, (10, 2, 18)>
- Total 3-stars: 1

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars possible: [14]. 

So, the answer is [14].
