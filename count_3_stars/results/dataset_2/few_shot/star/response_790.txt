Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (10, 9, 18)>
<1, (3, 12, 2)>
<2, (3, 12, 17)>
<3, (1, 12, 2)>
<4, (7, 13, 18)>
<5, (9, 15, 14)>
<6, (7, 17, 11)>
<7, (4, 6, 17)>
<8, (9, 19, 17)>
<9, (5, 18, 10)>
<10, (0, 9, 13)>
<11, (3, 14, 6)>
<12, (1, 3, 2)>
<13, (4, 18, 10)>
<14, (5, 11, 15)>
<15, (5, 4, 14)>
<16, (4, 3, 16)>
<17, (2, 6, 7)>
<18, (9, 13, 4)>
<19, (17, 8, 14)>
