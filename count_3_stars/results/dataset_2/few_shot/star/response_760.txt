Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 10, 11, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 10, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 13, 10, 12, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 13, 3, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 2, 14, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph are:

<0, (5, 8, 10)>
<0, (5, 8, 11)>
<0, (5, 10, 2)>
<0, (10, 12, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 13)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 12)>
<10, (13, 0, 3)>
<12, (9, 2, 14)>
<13, (5, 4, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
