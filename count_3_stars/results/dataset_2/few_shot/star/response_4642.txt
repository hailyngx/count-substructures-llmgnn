Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are central nodes in 3-star graphs:
   - Node 4 has 5 edges, which is the minimum number of edges required for a central node in a 3-star. So, we can start from Node 4.

2. For each edge connected to Node 4, check if the other two nodes connected by this edge share an edge between them (forming a 3-star).
   - (4, 7): Nodes 7 and 3 are not connected.
   - (4, 12): Nodes 12 and 6 are not connected.
   - (4, 10): Nodes 10 and 12 are connected, forming a 3-star <4, (10, 12)>.
   - (4, 11): Nodes 11 and 0 are not connected.
   - (4, 2): Nodes 2 and 13 are not connected.

3. Count the number of identified 3-stars: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (10, 12)>

Final answer: [1]
