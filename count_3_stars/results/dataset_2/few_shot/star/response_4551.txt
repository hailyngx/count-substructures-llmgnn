Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
We have a total of 20 nodes in the graph.
For each node, we check if there are any 3-star configurations centered at that node.
Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we search for nodes connected to the same node as the central node and count them as leaves in the 3-star configuration.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph with their central node and leaves:

<2, (17, 8, 7)>
<4, (3, 11, 15)>
<5, (8, 12, 16)>
<6, (19, 1, 12)>
<7, (2, 3, 11)>
<8, (2, 9, 12)>
<9, (17, 8, 1)>
<10, (12, 14, 19)>
<11, (3, 4, 15)>
<12, (5, 6, 8)>
<14, (10, 15, 19)>
<15, (7, 11, 14)>
<16, (0, 1, 5)>
<17, (2, 9, 19)>
<19, (6, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
