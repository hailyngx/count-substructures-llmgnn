Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step. 

Step 1: Identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors).
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 11, 8, 13, 6, 7, 12.

Step 2: For each central node, find its 3-star configurations.
- For node 5: (5, 9, 6, 1), (5, 9, 11, 1)
- For node 11: (11, 5, 10, 8), (11, 5, 15, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 11, 13, 19)
- For node 13: (13, 8, 16, 19)
- For node 6: (6, 5, 7, 0)
- For node 7: (7, 6, 16, 3)
- For node 12: (12, 19, 15, 18)

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars.
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- <5, (9, 11, 1)>
- <11, (5, 10, 8)>
- <11, (5, 15, 8)>
- <8, (11, 13, 19)>
- <13, (8, 16, 19)>
- <6, (5, 7, 0)>
- <7, (6, 16, 3)>
- <12, (19, 15, 18)>

Step 4: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars.
- Total number of unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
