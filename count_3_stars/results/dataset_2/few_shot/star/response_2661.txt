Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the subgraphs that follow the definition of a 3-star graph. In this case, we are looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the adjacency list provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (7, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 9, 3)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 3)>
4. <3, (9, 1, 2)>
5. <4, (7, 2, 6)>
6. <5, (6, 3, 2)>
7. <6, (4, 9, 5)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 2)>
9. <8, (7, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (6, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
