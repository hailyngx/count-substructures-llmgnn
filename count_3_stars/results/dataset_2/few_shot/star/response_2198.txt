Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph one by one:

1. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <6, (1, 4, 14)>
3. <6, (1, 8, 4)>
4. <6, (1, 8, 13)>
5. <6, (4, 1, 7)>
6. <6, (14, 6, 7)>
7. <9, (2, 7, 14)>
8. <9, (2, 11, 7)>
9. <9, (0, 13, 14)>
10. <4, (6, 1, 7)>
11. <4, (7, 1, 12)>
12. <4, (7, 14, 6)>
13. <7, (4, 1, 12)>
14. <7, (12, 1, 11)>
15. <7, (12, 13, 5)>
16. <7, (12, 5, 2)>
17. <7, (14, 6, 0)>
18. <8, (6, 1, 13)>
19. <8, (6, 4, 1)>
20. <8, (6, 1, 10)>
21. <8, (13, 1, 12)>
22. <8, (13, 1, 0)>
23. <13, (8, 1, 0)>
24. <13, (8, 1, 12)>
25. <12, (7, 1, 11)>
26. <12, (7, 5, 3)>
27. <12, (7, 14, 0)>
28. <0, (9, 13, 14)>
29. <14, (6, 7, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
