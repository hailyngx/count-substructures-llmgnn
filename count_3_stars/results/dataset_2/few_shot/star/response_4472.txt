Response:
First, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph by identifying nodes that are the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed by the center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center node.

Given the adjacency list, we can start by looking at each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars.

By analyzing the connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<2, (7, 6, 10)>
<3, (15, 20, 21)>
<9, (22, 7, 17)>
<10, (2, 6, 18)>
<11, (24, 4, 25)>
<12, (18, 23, 12)>
<13, (20, 24, 13)>
<18, (17, 10, 12)>
<19, (0, 26, 24)>
<21, (28, 27, 20)>
<22, (9, 5, 25)>
<23, (0, 28, 25)>
<24, (13, 19, 11)>
<25, (22, 11, 1)>
<26, (19, 16, 6)>
<27, (21, 5, 8)>
<28, (21, 1, 4)>
<29, (27, 16, 29)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [18].
