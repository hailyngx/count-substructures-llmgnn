Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Based on the adjacency list, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
