Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that the possible central nodes for the 3-stars are: 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, and 13.

2. For each central node, let's find the connected nodes to form a 3-star structure:
    - For node 1: (1, 6, 3, 13), (1, 7, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3, 6), (1, 13, 11)
    - For node 2: (2, 4, 7), (2, 13, 14), (2, 12), (2, 7, 4), (2, 13, 2)
    - For node 5: (5, 6, 9), (5, 10, 7), (5, 9, 12)
    - For node 9: (9, 6, 5), (9, 10, 5), (9, 12, 11)
    - For node 11: (11, 13, 14), (11, 12, 9)
    - For node 13: (13, 1, 3), (13, 2, 11), (13, 8, 7)

3. Counting the unique 3-stars:
    - <1, (6, 3, 13)>
    - <1, (7, 4)>
    - <1, (0)>
    - <5, (6, 9)>
    - <5, (10, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 5)>
    - <9, (10, 5)>
    - <9, (12, 11)>
    - <11, (13, 14)>
    - <11, (12, 9)>
    - <13, (1, 3)>
    - <13, (2, 11)>
    - <13, (8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
