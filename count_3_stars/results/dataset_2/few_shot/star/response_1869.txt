Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of occurrences of each node in the given graph and then using the formula for counting 3-stars in a graph.

Let's calculate the count of each node first:  
- Node 0 appears 3 times  
- Node 1 appears 3 times  
- Node 2 appears 2 times  
- Node 3 appears 4 times  
- Node 4 appears 4 times  
- Node 5 appears 2 times  
- Node 6 appears 1 time  
- Node 7 appears 3 times  
- Node 8 appears 2 times  
- Node 9 appears 1 time  
- Node 10 appears 4 times  
- Node 11 appears 4 times  
- Node 12 appears 5 times  
- Node 13 appears 2 times  
- Node 14 appears 4 times  
- Node 15 appears 2 times  
- Node 16 appears 3 times  
- Node 17 appears 3 times  
- Node 18 appears 5 times  
- Node 19 appears 4 times  
- Node 20 appears 3 times  
- Node 21 appears 2 times  
- Node 22 appears 4 times  
- Node 23 appears 4 times  
- Node 24 appears 3 times  
- Node 25 appears 2 times  
- Node 26 appears 2 times  
- Node 27 appears 4 times  
- Node 28 appears 3 times  
- Node 29 appears 2 times  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph using the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \binom{k_i}{3} \]

Where:  
- \( n \) is the total number of nodes
- \( k_i \) is the count of node \( i \) in the graph

Substitute the values we calculated above and calculate the number of 3-stars. Finally, output the answer inside brackets. 

\[ \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{30} \binom{k_i}{3} \right] \]
