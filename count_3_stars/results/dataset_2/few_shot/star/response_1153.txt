Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars for each node that can act as the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can find all such configurations for each center node.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<Node 0, (5, 9, 6)>
<Node 0, (5, 9, 8)>
<Node 0, (5, 6, 2)>
<Node 0, (5, 8, 2)>
<Node 0, (9, 6, 1)>
<Node 0, (9, 8, 4)>
<Node 0, (6, 1, 7)>
<Node 0, (6, 7, 3)>
<Node 0, (6, 2, 4)>
<Node 0, (8, 4, 2)>

<Node 1, (5, 9, 6)>
<Node 1, (5, 9, 0)>
<Node 1, (9, 6, 7)>
<Node 1, (6, 7, 3)>
<Node 1, (6, 2, 4)>

<Node 2, (5, 6, 4)>
<Node 2, (5, 6, 0)>
<Node 2, (5, 6, 1)>
<Node 2, (5, 6, 3)>
<Node 2, (6, 1, 7)>
<Node 2, (6, 7, 3)>
<Node 2, (6, 7, 8)>

<Node 3, (5, 7, 8)>
<Node 3, (7, 8, 4)>

<Node 4, (8, 4, 2)>

<Node 5, (9, 5, 3)>

<Node 6, (9, 6, 1)>
<Node 6, (9, 6, 7)>

<Node 7, (8, 7, 3)>

<Node 8, (9, 8, 4)>
<Node 8, (7, 8, 3)>

<Node 9, (5, 9, 0)>

[Number of 3-stars: 27]
