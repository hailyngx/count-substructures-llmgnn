Response:
First, we need to find the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by identifying nodes that have exactly three edges.

Nodes with exactly three edges: Node 6, Node 12

Next, let's look at the neighbors of Node 6 and Node 12 to see if they form 3-stars by having the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to Node 7 and Node 13
- Node 7 is connected to Node 6, Node 3, Node 0, and Node 11 (Note: This is a 3-star <7, (6, 3, 0)> with Node 7 as the center)
- Node 13 is connected to Node 6, Node 1, Node 11, and Node 10 (Note: This is a 3-star <13, (6, 1, 11)> with Node 13 as the center)

For Node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to Node 3, Node 14, and Node 11 (Note: This is a 3-star <12, (3, 14, 11)> with Node 12 as the center)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<7, (6, 3, 0)>
<13, (6, 1, 11)>
<12, (3, 14, 11)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [3] unique 3-stars.
