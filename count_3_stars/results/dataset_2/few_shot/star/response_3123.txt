Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are exactly connected to 3 other nodes. These nodes will act as the central nodes of the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 15, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 14.

Now, letâ€™s count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0: It forms <0, (11, 6, 7)>.
- For Node 5: It forms <5, (16, 15, 14)>.
- For Node 9: It forms <9, (6, 8, 15)>.
- For Node 15: It forms <15, (9, 4, 7)>.
- For Node 16: It forms <16, (11, 8, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
