Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by examining each node to see if it is the central node of a 3-star. 

The nodes with 3-stars are:
- Node 11: <11, (16, 5, 17)>, <11, (16, 5, 29)>, <11, (5, 26, 29)>
- Node 5: <5, (11, 26, 0)>, <5, (11, 26, 12)>
- Node 16: <16, (11, 12, 1)>, <16, (11, 12, 13)>, <16, (12, 24, 23)>
- Node 26: <26, (7, 9, 28)>, <26, (5, 11, 29)>
- Node 0: <0, (20, 1, 17)>, <0, (1, 10, 29)>
- Node 24: <24, (15, 6, 23)>, 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<11, (16, 5, 17)>, <11, (16, 5, 29)>, <11, (5, 26, 29)>, <5, (11, 26, 0)>, <5, (11, 26, 12)>, <16, (11, 12, 1)>, <16, (11, 12, 13)>, <16, (12, 24, 23)>, <26, (7, 9, 28)>, <26, (5, 11, 29)>, <0, (20, 1, 17)>, <0, (1, 10, 29)>, <24, (15, 6, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
