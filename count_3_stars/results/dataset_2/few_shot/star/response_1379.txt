Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node's connections in the context of a 3-star structure. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node, we can identify 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to three neighbors.

Now, let's find and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4. <1, (5, 9, 4)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 7. <3, (6, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1. <4, (5, 8, 1)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 1. <7, (6, 8, 1)>
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
