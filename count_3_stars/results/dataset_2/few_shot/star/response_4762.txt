Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 11)>
<1, (2, 7, 12)>
<2, (7, 1, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<2, (8, 3, 6)>
<3, (8, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 11)>
<5, (4, 1, 11)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 11)>
<8, (2, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 13)>
<10, (5, 6, 10)>
<11, (4, 2, 11)>
<12, (7, 2, 12)>
<13, (0, 3, 13)>
<14, (2, 9, 14)>
<15, (4, 11, 12)>
<16, (12, 11, 9)>
<17, (12, 13, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
