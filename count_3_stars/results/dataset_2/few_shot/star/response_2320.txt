Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 forms 3-stars with the nodes (1, 2, 7), (0, 3, 9), and (8, 4, 9).
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with the nodes (2, 5, 7).
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with the nodes (8, 9, 3).
4. Node 0 forms a 3-star with the nodes (6, 5, 9).

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (8, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 5, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
