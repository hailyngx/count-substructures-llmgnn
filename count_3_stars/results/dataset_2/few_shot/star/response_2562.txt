Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9, 8)>
- <1, (3, 2, 4)>
- <2, (9, 1, 4)>
- <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- <4, (9, 1, 6)>
- <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- <6, (5, 7, 4)>
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>
- <8, (5, 1, 6)>
- <9, (4, 2, 3)>

Thus, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
