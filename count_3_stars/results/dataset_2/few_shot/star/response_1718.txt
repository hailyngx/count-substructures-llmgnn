Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 14, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, 13, 14, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 11, 13, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 10, 11, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 11, 12, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 7, 5, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 12

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is part of <1, (3, 14, 5)>
- Node 2 is part of <2, (8, 4, 13)>
- Node 5 is part of <5, (1, 11, 13)>
- Node 7 is part of <7, (6, 3, 10)>
- Node 8 is part of <8, (9, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 is part of <9, (6, 8, 11)>
- Node 10 is part of <10, (3, 11, 12)>
- Node 11 is part of <11, (9, 10, 7)>
- Node 12 is part of <12, (10, 11, 8)>
- Node 13 is part of <13, (9, 2, 5)>
- Node 14 is part of <14, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get 11.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
