Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Since we are looking for 3-stars in this graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the 3-star configurations one by one.

1. <0, (5, 9, 6)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 2)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 6)>
4. <3, (9, 8, 0)>
5. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (8, 4, 0)>
7. <6, (9, 7, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 6, 2)>
9. <8, (5, 4, 3)>
10. <9, (6, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
