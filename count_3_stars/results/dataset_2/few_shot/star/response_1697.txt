Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:

<6, (5, 1, 14)>
<6, (10, 1, 14)>
<6, (3, 1, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 1)>
<6, (5, 3, 1)>
<6, (10, 3, 1)>
<9, (14, 12, 4)>
<9, (14, 12, 11)>
<9, (14, 12, 8)>
<4, (7, 12, 0)>
<4, (7, 12, 11)>
<4, (7, 12, 2)>
<7, (10, 2, 1)>
<0, (14, 11, 1)>
<14, (11, 8, 6)>
<14, (11, 8, 12)>
<14, (11, 8, 4)>
<12, (11, 8, 4)>
<12, (11, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
