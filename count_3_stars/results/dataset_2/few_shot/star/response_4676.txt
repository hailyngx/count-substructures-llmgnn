Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
