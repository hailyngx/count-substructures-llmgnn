Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9]
