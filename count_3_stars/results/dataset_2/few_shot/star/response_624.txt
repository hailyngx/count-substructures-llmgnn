Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can examine each node and check if it is the center node of any 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 6)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 1, 9)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (7, 8, 5)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 9)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
