Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (11, 8, 13)>
2. <0, (11, 4, 12)>
3. <0, (11, 1, 8)>
4. <0, (11, 12, 1)>
5. <0, (8, 10, 13)>
6. <0, (8, 11, 1)>
7. <1, (11, 14, 0)>
8. <1, (11, 0, 8)>
9. <2, (9, 3, 7)>
10. <2, (9, 2, 14)>
11. <2, (3, 14, 7)>
12. <3, (5, 13, 4)>
13. <3, (5, 13, 0)>
14. <3, (5, 4, 13)>
15. <4, (5, 13, 3)>
16. <4, (5, 2, 13)>
17. <5, (13, 4, 0)>
18. <7, (5, 2, 14)>
19. <7, (5, 14, 9)>
20. <9, (10, 2, 14)>
21. <10, (9, 13, 5)>
22. <10, (9, 14, 7)>
23. <11, (0, 8, 13)>
24. <13, (10, 5, 4)>
25. <13, (10, 3, 0)>
26. <13, (10, 5, 0)>
27. <14, (10, 3, 1)>
28. <14, (10, 7, 9)>

There are 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [28].
