Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 15, and node 19
Node 6 is connected to node 17, 15, 19, 16, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 17, 11, 8, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 19
Node 10 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 11 is connected to node 7, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 15, 7, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 17, and node 0
Node 15 is connected to node 17, 1, 13, 6, and node 5
Node 16 is connected to node 19, 6, and node 2
Node 17 is connected to node 14, 1, 6, 15, and node 7
Node 18 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 16, 6, and node 9

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 adjacent nodes (leaves).
    - Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes (exceeds 3).
    - Node 4 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 6 has 5 adjacent nodes (exceeds 3).
    - Node 7 has 4 adjacent nodes (exceeds 3).
    - Node 8 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 9 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 12 has 2 adjacent nodes (below 3).
    - Node 13 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 14 has 2 adjacent nodes (below 3).
    - Node 15 has 5 adjacent nodes (exceeds 3).
    - Node 16 has 3 adjacent nodes.
    - Node 17 has 5 adjacent nodes (exceeds 3).
    
Step 2: Given that a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can see that nodes 4, 5, 8, 9, 16 have the potential to be central nodes. 
Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars for each potential central node.

- For central node 4, the 3-stars are:
    <4, (8, 9, 5)>
    [<4, (8, 9, 5)>]

- For central node 5, the 3-stars are:
    <5, (4, 19, 15)>
    [<5, (4, 19, 15)>]

- For central node 8, the 3-stars are:
    <8, (4, 1, 7)>
    [<8, (4, 1, 7)>]

- For central node 9, the 3-stars are:
    <9, (4, 19, 3)>
    [<9, (4, 19, 3)>]

- For central node 16, the 3-stars are:
    <16, (2, 19, 6)>
    [<16, (2, 19, 6)>]

Final Answer: [5]
