Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (28, 4, 9)
- Node 3: (27, 26, 18)
- Node 4: (6, 25, 3)
- Node 9: (19, 15, 24)
- Node 11: (29, 14, 22)
- Node 13: (21, 19, 28)
- Node 15: (5, 26, 19)
- Node 18: (8, 3, 27)
- Node 22: (2, 11, 7)
- Node 24: (0, 7, 9)
- Node 26: (23, 16, 15)
- Node 27: (29, 14, 3)
- Node 28: (20, 14, 13)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (28, 4, 9)>, <3, (27, 26, 18)>, <4, (6, 25, 3)>, <9, (19, 15, 24)>, <11, (29, 14, 22)>, <13, (21, 19, 28)>, <15, (5, 26, 19)>, <18, (8, 3, 27)>, <22, (2, 11, 7)>, <24, (0, 7, 9)>, <26, (23, 16, 15)>, <27, (29, 14, 3)>, <28, (20, 14, 13)>.

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph, therefore the final answer is [13].
