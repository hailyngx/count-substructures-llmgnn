Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9)

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences of 3-stars.

First, let's check each node and its connections to see if any of them form a 3-star pattern.

The 3-star pattern we are looking for has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the 3-star patterns in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
