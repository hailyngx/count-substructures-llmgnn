Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star structures in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three leaves, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 28, and 10
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 5, 10, and 23
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 5, 19, and 25
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 7, 1, and 22

Next, we will construct the 3-star structures that involve these nodes. Let's count the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph.
