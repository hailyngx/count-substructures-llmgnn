Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 2 forming a 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (1, 8, 2)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 9 forming a 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (3, 10, 9)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 2 forming a 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (1, 14, 2)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 12 forming a 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (3, 11, 12)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 7 forming a 3-star with center at node 6: <6, (11, 8, 7)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 13 forming a 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (1, 10, 13)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 12 forming a 3-star with center at node 10: <10, (1, 11, 12)>
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 5 forming a 3-star with center at node 11: <11, (10, 7, 5)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0 forming a 3-star with center at node 13: <13, (9, 4, 0)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8 forming a 3-star with center at node 14: <14, (3, 4, 8)>

Thus, we have identified all the 3-stars in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
