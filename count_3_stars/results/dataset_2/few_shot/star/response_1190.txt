Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph should be calculated by finding all possible 3-stars centered at each node. 

Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars centered at that node:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

2. Node 1: <1, (17, 10, 9)>
   
3. Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

5. Node 4: <4, (7, 16, 15)> 

6. Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

7. Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

8. Node 7: <7, (4, 16, 19)>, <7, (16, 6, 11)>

9. Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

10. Node 9: <9, (14, 1, 18)>

11. Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

12. Node 11: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

13. Node 12: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

14. Node 13: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

15. Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

16. Node 15: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

17. Node 16: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

18. Node 17: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

19. Node 18: <18, (10, 19, 9)>, <18, (19, 11, 12)>

20. Node 19: No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have: 
[<1, (17, 10, 9)>, <4, (7, 16, 15)>, <7, (4, 16, 19)>, <7, (16, 6, 11)>, <9, (14, 1, 18)>, <18, (10, 19, 9)>, <18, (19, 11, 12)>]
