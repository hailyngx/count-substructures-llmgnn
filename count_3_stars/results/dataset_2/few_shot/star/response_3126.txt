Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 19: <6, (9, 10, 19)>
2. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 14, and 19: <8, (7, 14, 19)>
3. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 19: <9, (6, 10, 19)>
4. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 15: <10, (6, 9, 15)>
5. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 10, and 19: <15, (0, 10, 19)>
6. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 7: <16, (6, 4, 7)>
7. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 15: <19, (6, 8, 15)>
8. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, and 17: <4, (8, 13, 17)>
