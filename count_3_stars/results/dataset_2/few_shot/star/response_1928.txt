Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
From the given graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (9, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (9, 6, _)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 0)>
6. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
7. <6, (4, 1, 3)>
8. <7, (4, 1, 8)>
9. <8, (5, 9, 4)>
10. <9, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
