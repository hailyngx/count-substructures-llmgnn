Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present.

From the provided adjacency list and the edges in the graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (7, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
