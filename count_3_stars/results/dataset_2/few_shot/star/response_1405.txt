Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all 3-stars:

- Nodes with degree 3 and one neighbor (2 nodes in total): Nodes 5 and 13
- Nodes with degree 4 and two neighbors (6 pairs in total): (Nodes 1, 0), (3, 7), (10, 15), (12, 2), (14, 18), (16, 9)
- Nodes with degree 5 and three neighbors (4 nodes in total): Nodes 17, 6, 19, and 16

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:

- For nodes with degree 3 and one neighbor, we have 2 * 1 = 2 unique 3-stars.
- For nodes with degree 4 and two neighbors:
    - (1, (0, 3, 11)) and (3, (1, 7, 10)) will form the same 3-stars, so we count them as 1.
    - Similarly, (12, (2, 4, 9)) and (14, (9, 14, 18)) will be the same 3-stars, so we count them as 1.
    - Therefore, we have 4 * 1 = 4 unique 3-stars.
- For nodes with degree 5 and three neighbors, we already have all unique pairs, so we have 4 unique 3-stars.

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:

Total = 2 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, we found a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
