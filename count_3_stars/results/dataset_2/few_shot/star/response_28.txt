Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes of each potential 3-star. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have a degree of 3.

From the given adjacency list, the nodes with a degree of 3 are:
- Node 4
- Node 12
- Node 14

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by these central nodes:

For Node 4:
- <4, (7, 3, 13)>

For Node 12:
- <12, (1, 9, 13)>

For Node 14:
- <14, (3, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 3, 13)>, <12, (1, 9, 13)>, and <14, (3, 2, 0)>.
