Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14)

Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 11, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 10, 8, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 12, 4, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 12, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 12, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 10, 7, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-star graphs. 

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 12 has 3 edges connected to it: (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 11)
- Node 13 has 3 edges connected to it: (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 8)
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it, so we will exclude it.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph:
<12, (5, 6, 11)>
<13, (6, 1, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
