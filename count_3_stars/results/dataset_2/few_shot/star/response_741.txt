Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 3) (14, 3) (12, 0) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 10, 12, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 0, 11, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 13, 10, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 11, 14, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 13, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 2, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 8: <0, (6, 10, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <1, (4, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 13: <2, (9, 4, 13)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 14: <3, (6, 11, 14)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 11: <5, (6, 13, 11)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and 8: <7, (4, 11, 8)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 13: <9, (2, 10, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
