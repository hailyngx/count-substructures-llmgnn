Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's consider each node one by one:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 23 and 26.
   - Since node 0 does not form a 3-star, we move on.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 22, 12, 28, and 11. 
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 12, and 28: <1, (22, 12, 28)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 15.
   - Since node 2 does not form a 3-star, we move on.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 13, and 23.
   - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 13, and 23: <3, (25, 13, 23)>

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 24, 16, 26, and 2.

   - Since node 29 does not form a 3-star, we have considered all nodes.

After analyzing all nodes, we have found the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (22, 12, 28)>, <3, (25, 13, 23)>, <5, (22, 28, 15)>, <11, (18, 24, 1)>, <12, (7, 22, 1)>, <15, (25, 17, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
