Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (5, 28, 15)>
<10, (16, 21, 11)>
<21, (27, 22, 3)>
<11, (20, 12, 7)>
<16, (29, 20, 10)>
<5, (2, 26, 14)>
<0, (23, 14, 26)>
<26, (19, 5, 15)>
<9, (24, 7, 4)>
<19, (27, 20, 26)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
