Response:
The task is to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Here's how we can approach this problem step by step:

1. Identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:
    - Look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - For each such node, check if it is connected to each of its neighbors forming a 3-star pattern.

2. Count the unique 3-stars. 

Let's go ahead and identify the 3-stars:

<13, (21, 28, 14)>
<22, (11, 7, 12)>
<1, (22, 17, 28)>
<2, (18, 26, 24)>
<4, (8, 23, 10)>
<7, (22, 29, 19)>
<0, (28, 21, 1)>
<14, (13, 26, 11)>
<6, (21, 15, -)>
<17, (1, 16, -)>
<8, (4, 20, -)>
<9, (24, 19, -)>
<11, (22, 2, 14)>
<12, (22, 24, -)>
<15, (6, 25, -)>
<16, (17, 28, 23)>
<18, (2, 27, 25)>
<20, (8, 3, -)>
<19, (7, 10, 9)>
<5, (14, - , -)>
<3, (20, - , -)>
<23, (4, 10, 16)>
<24, (2, 27, 9)>
<25, (18, 15, -)>
<26, (2, 8, 14)>
<27, (29, 18, 11)>
<28, (13, 0, 1)>
<29, (7, 27, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
