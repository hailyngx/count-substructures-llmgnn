Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[5]

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>

[4]

<2, (9, 4, 8)>

[0]

[6]

[1]

[7]

[3]

[8]

In this graph, there are a total of [7] 3-stars.
