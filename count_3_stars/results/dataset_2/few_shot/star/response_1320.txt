Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify 3-stars by considering each node as the center in turn and checking if it has exactly three neighbors. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
