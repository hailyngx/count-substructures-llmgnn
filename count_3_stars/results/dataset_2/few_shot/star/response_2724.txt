Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars can be found by iterating through all the nodes and checking if they have exactly 3 neighbors. Then, for each center node, we check if the neighboring nodes are connected among themselves. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Find the center nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

- Center nodes: 11, 15, 17, 5, 7

2. Check for valid 3-stars for each center node:

- For node 11: (12, 10, 19)
- For node 15: (19, 13, 11)
- For node 17: (7, 4, 18)
- For node 5: (8, 19, 2)
- For node 7: (10, 0, 17)

So, the unique 3-stars found are: 

<<11, (12, 10, 19)>, <15, (19, 13, 11)>, <17, (7, 4, 18)>, <5, (8, 19, 2)>, <7, (10, 0, 17)>>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
