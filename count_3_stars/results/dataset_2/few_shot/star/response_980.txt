Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that are the centers of potential 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes: 26, 24, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 28, 16, and 27
- Node 10 is connected to 3 nodes: 5, 8, and 1
- Node 22 is connected to 3 nodes: 17, 12, and 16

Now, let's analyze each potential 3-star to see if they meet all the criteria of a 3-star.

For Node 5:
- Nodes connected to Node 5 (potential 3-star center): 26, 24, and 8
- All pairs of nodes connected to Node 5 are not directly connected to each other, so this is a valid 3-star.
<5, (26, 24, 8)>

For Node 9:
- Nodes connected to Node 9 (potential 3-star center): 28, 16, and 27
- All pairs of nodes connected to Node 9 are not directly connected to each other, so this is a valid 3-star.
<9, (28, 16, 27)>

For Node 10:
- Nodes connected to Node 10 (potential 3-star center): 5, 8, and 1
- All pairs of nodes connected to Node 10 are not directly connected to each other, so this is a valid 3-star.
<10, (5, 8, 1)>

For Node 22:
- Nodes connected to Node 22 (potential 3-star center): 17, 12, and 16
- All pairs of nodes connected to Node 22 are not directly connected to each other, so this is a valid 3-star.
<22, (17, 12, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
