Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Based on the adjacency list given, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find the nodes that are connected in the configuration of a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes. Let's list them:

<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>

By listing the unique 3-stars found, we can count a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
