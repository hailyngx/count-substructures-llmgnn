Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through the process step by step:
1. Identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 
2. For each identified node, find the three connected nodes to form a 3-star pattern.
3. List the unique 3-star patterns found.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-star patterns in the given graph are:
<1, (8, 15, 19)>
<2, (11, 13, 16)>
<3, (5, 16, 18)>
<4, (14, 12, 16)>
<5, (11, 13, 16)>
<6, (8, 15, 16)>
<7, (2, 9, 18)>
<8, (1, 6, 16)>
<9, (1, 15, 19)>
<11, (2, 5, 19)>
<12, (4, 5, 17)>
<13, (2, 5, 19)>
<14, (4, 5, 19)>
<15, (1, 6, 18)>
<16, (2, 3, 9)>
<18, (3, 7, 15)>
<19, (1, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17]. The unique 3-stars can be represented by:
<1, (8, 15, 19)>, <2, (11, 13, 16)>, <3, (5, 16, 18)>, <4, (14, 12, 16)>, <5, (11, 13, 16)>, <6, (8, 15, 16)>, <7, (2, 9, 18)>, <8, (1, 6, 16)>, <9, (1, 15, 19)>, <11, (2, 5, 19)>, <12, (4, 5, 17)>, <13, (2, 5, 19)>, <14, (4, 5, 19)>, <15, (1, 6, 18)>, <16, (2, 3, 9)>, <18, (3, 7, 15)>, <19, (1, 9, 11)>.
