Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 3, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (9, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
