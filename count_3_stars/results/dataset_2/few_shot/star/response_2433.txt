Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 8, 2, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 13, 1, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 13, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 11, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 14, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 10, 2, 5, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 8, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 10, 9, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (1, 4, 14)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 11)>
<6, (3, 9, 11)>
<9, (1, 6, 14)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<13, (0, 4, 5)>
<12, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 11, 13)>
<14, (5, 9, 10)>

So, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
