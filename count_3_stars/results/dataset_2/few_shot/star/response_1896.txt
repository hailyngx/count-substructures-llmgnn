Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 13, 14, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 10, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 10, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 11, 13, 12, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 11, 6, 12, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 7, 13, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 13, 7, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 11, 12, 2, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 12, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 13, 14)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (5, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (10, 2, 12)>
<7, (11, 12, 13)>
<8, (1, 11, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<10, (4, 6, 12)>
<11, (8, 13, 7)>
<12, (10, 6, 14)>
<13, (9, 11, 12)>
<14, (12, 2, 14)>
<15, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
