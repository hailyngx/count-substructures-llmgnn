Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the information provided.

We see that the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars with their central nodes and leaf nodes:

- Central node: 0
  Leaf nodes: 9, 3, 6
  <0, (9, 3, 6)>

- Central node: 1
  Leaf nodes: 5, 9, 4
  <1, (5, 9, 4)>
  
- Central node: 3
  Leaf nodes: 9, 4, 1
  <3, (9, 4, 1)>

- Central node: 6
  Leaf nodes: 4, 7, 2
  <6, (4, 7, 2)>

- Central node: 8
  Leaf nodes: 9, 7, 3
  <8, (9, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
