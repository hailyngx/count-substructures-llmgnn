Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and identify the unique 3-stars, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to three leaves, we will examine each node's connections to identify these patterns.

Examining the adjacency list for each node:
1. Node 0: No 3-star.
2. Node 1: No 3-star.
3. Node 2: No 3-star.
4. Node 3: No 3-star.
5. Node 4: No 3-star.
6. Node 5: No 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 2)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star.
9. Node 8: <8, (9, 13, 2)>
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 1)>
11. Node 10: No 3-star.
12. Node 11: <11, (6, 5, 12)>
13. Node 12: No 3-star.
14. Node 13: No 3-star.
15. Node 14: No 3-star.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<8, (9, 13, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
