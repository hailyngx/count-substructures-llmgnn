Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 19) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 17, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 17, 12, 6, and node 19
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 16, 5, 4, 19, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 10, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 19, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 16, 2, 1, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 15
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 18, 2, and node 17
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 15, 3, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 16, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 18, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 15
Node 15 is connected to node 16, 14, 8, and node 10
Node 16 is connected to node 11, 15, 3, and node 6
Node 17 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 18 is connected to node 9, and node 12
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (11, 19, 3)>
2. <6, (16, 2, 10)>
3. <8, (9, 13, 15)>
4. <9, (8, 18, 17)>
5. <10, (4, 15, 3)>
6. <11, (16, 5, 0)>
7. <12, (4, 18, 1)>
8. <16, (11, 15, 6)>
9. <17, (9, 1, 0)>
10. <19, (5, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
