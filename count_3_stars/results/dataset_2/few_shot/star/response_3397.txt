Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we can determine all 3-stars:

<0, (9, 14, 10)>  
<0, (9, 14, 11)>  
<0, (9, 14, 5)>  
<0, (9, 14, 0)>  
<0, (9, 14, 1)>  
<0, (9, 10, 12)>  
<0, (9, 10, 7)>  
<0, (9, 11, 5)>  
<0, (9, 11, 0)>  
<0, (9, 11, 1)>  
<0, (9, 5, 12)>  
<0, (9, 5, 0)>  
<0, (9, 5, 1)>  
<0, (9, 1, 0)>  
<0, (14, 10, 7)>  
<0, (14, 11, 5)>  
<0, (14, 11, 0)>  
<0, (14, 11, 1)>  
<0, (14, 5, 12)>  
<0, (14, 5, 0)>  
<0, (14, 5, 1)>  
<1, (13, 0, 5)>  
<2, (5, 3, 11)>  
<2, (5, 3, 12)>  
<2, (5, 3, 2)>  
<2, (5, 11, 12)>  
<2, (5, 11, 2)>  
<2, (5, 12, 3)>  
<2, (5, 12, 2)>  
<2, (11, 3, 12)>  
<2, (11, 3, 2)>  
<2, (11, 12, 3)>  
<3, (7, 11, 2)>  
<3, (7, 11, 12)>  
<3, (7, 2, 12)>  
<5, (0, 1, 13)>  
<7, (6, 3, 10)>  
<10, (0, 12, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].
These are all the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (9, 14, 10)>  
<0, (9, 14, 11)>  
<0, (9, 14, 5)>  
<0, (9, 14, 0)>  
<0, (9, 14, 1)>  
<0, (9, 10, 12)>  
<0, (9, 10, 7)>  
<0, (9, 11, 5)>  
<0, (9, 11, 0)>  
<0, (9, 11, 1)>  
<0, (9, 5, 12)>  
<0, (9, 5, 0)>  
<0, (9, 5, 1)>  
<0, (9, 1, 0)>  
<0, (14, 10, 7)>  
<0, (14, 11, 5)>  
<0, (14, 11, 0)>  
<0, (14, 11, 1)>  
<0, (14, 5, 12)>  
<0, (14, 5, 0)>  
<0, (14, 5, 1)>

<2, (5, 3, 12)>  
<2, (5, 3, 2)>  
<2, (5, 11, 12)>  
<2, (5, 11, 2)>  
<2, (5, 12, 3)>  
<2, (5, 12, 2)>  
<2, (11, 3, 12)>  
<2, (11, 3, 2)>  
<2, (11, 12, 3)>  
<3, (7, 11, 2)>  
<3, (7, 11, 12)>  
<3, (7, 2, 12)>  
<5, (0, 1, 13)>  
<7, (6, 3, 10)>  
<10, (0, 12, 7)>
