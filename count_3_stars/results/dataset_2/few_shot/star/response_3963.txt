Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star combinations: 

<0, (13, 9, -)>
<1, (10, 7, 11)>
<2, (13, 16, 4)>
<3, (16, 9, 12)>
<4, (5, 6, 11)>
<5, (19, 4, 14)>
<6, (8, 17, 18)>
<7, (16, 1, -)>
<8, (6, 18, -)>
<9, (17, 0, 3)>
<10, (15, 12, -)>
<11, (19, 1, 4)>
<12, (10, 6, 3)>
<13, (2, 0, -)>
<14, (5, 15, 1)>
<15, (10, 14, -)>
<16, (7, 17, 3)>
<17, (19, 16, 6)>
<18, (8, 6, -)>
<19, (5, 11, 17)>

There are a total of [19] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
