Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify all such unique 3-stars:

<2, (13, 19, 7)>
<4, (1, 12, 17)>
<7, (2, 10, 16)>
<10, (7, 14, 18)>
<11, (3, 18, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is **5**.

So, the final answer is **[5]**.
