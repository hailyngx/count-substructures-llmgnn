Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that the center node can have 1, 4, 7, 8, or 9 as the central node since they have exactly three neighboring nodes. 

1. Let's start with the node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 2, 5, and 9
    - The possible 3-star configurations with node 1 as the center are:
        - <1, (7, 5, 9)>
2. Moving on to node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, 5, and 6
    - The possible 3-star configurations with node 4 as the center are:
        - <4, (7, 5, 6)>
3. Looking at node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 5, and 1
    - The possible 3-star configurations with node 7 as the center are:
        - <7, (4, 5, 1)>
4. Checking for node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 0
    - The possible 3-star configurations with node 8 as the center are:
        - <8, (4, 9, 0)>
5. Finally, examining node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
    - The possible 3-star configurations with node 9 as the center are:
        - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
    - <1, (7, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (4, 5, 1)>
    - <8, (4, 9, 0)>
