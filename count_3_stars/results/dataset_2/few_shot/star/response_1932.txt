Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a total of 20 nodes. For a 3-star, we need a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center node. Hence, each 3-star will have 4 nodes in total.

From the given adjacency list, we observe that the nodes can form multiple 3-star configurations. Let's find all unique 3-stars:

<0, (8, 5, 12)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<3, (19, 11, 17)>
<7, (16, 4, 15)>
<10, (4, 13, 14)>
<18, (17, 12, 15)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars found are 6 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is: [6].
