Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Starting from Node 0:
<0, (4, 1, 11)>

2. Moving to Node 1:
- No 3-stars as Node 1 has only 2 edges.

3. Moving to Node 2:
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<2, (9, 14, 11)>
<2, (8, 4, 14)>
<2, (8, 4, 11)>
<2, (8, 9, 14)>
<2, (8, 9, 11)>
<2, (12, 6, 3)>

4. Moving to Node 3:
<3, (5, 2, 12)>
<3, (5, 14, 10)>

5. Moving to Node 4:
<4, (7, 8, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 6, 10)>
<4, (7, 6, 13)>
<4, (7, 6, 11)>

6. Moving to Node 5:
- No 3-stars as Node 5 has only 2 edges.

7. Moving to Node 6:
<6, (7, 13, 11)>
<6, (7, 13, 6)>
<6, (7, 13, 12)>

8. Moving to Node 7:
- No 3-stars as Node 7 has only 2 edges.

9. Moving to Node 8:
- No 3-stars as Node 8 has only 2 edges.

10. Moving to Node 9:
- No 3-stars as Node 9 has only 2 edges.

11. Moving to Node 10:
<10, (5, 7, 13)>
<10, (5, 7, 3)>
<10, (5, 14, 3)>
<10, (7, 3, 14)>
<10, (7, 6, 13)>
<10, (7, 6, 11)>
<10, (7, 6, 14)>

12. Moving to Node 11:
- No 3-stars as Node 11 has only 2 edges.

13. Moving to Node 12:
- No 3-stars as Node 12 has only 2 edges.

14. Moving to Node 13:
<13, (5, 11, 1)>
<13, (5, 11, 6)>
<13, (1, 13, 0)>
<13, (1, 13, 10)>

15. Moving to Node 14:
<14, (9, 4, 2)>
<14, (9, 4, 3)>
<14, (9, 4, 10)>
<14, (9, 4, 14)>
<14, (4, 2, 3)>
<14, (4, 2, 10)>
<14, (4, 2, 11)>
<14, (4, 3, 10)>
<14, (4, 3, 11)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get the total number of 3-stars as [24].
