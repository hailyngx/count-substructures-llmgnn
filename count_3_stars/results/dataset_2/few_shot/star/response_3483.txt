Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then count the occurrences of these 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 11)>
<0, (3, 11, 14)>
<0, (7, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 4, 13)>
<1, (4, 11, 13)>
<2, (0, 11, 14)>
<4, (9, 11, 14)>
<5, (6, 7, 12)>
<5, (6, 12, 5)>
<6, (9, 10, 5)>
<9, (4, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 10, 9)>
<10, (6, 8, 9)>
<13, (1, 9, 12)>
<14, (0, 11, 14)>

Counting the occurrences of these unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 11)>: 1
<0, (3, 11, 14)>: 1
<0, (7, 11, 14)>: 1
<1, (3, 4, 13)>: 1
<1, (4, 11, 13)>: 1
<2, (0, 11, 14)>: 1
<4, (9, 11, 14)>: 1
<5, (6, 7, 12)>: 1
<5, (6, 12, 5)>: 1
<6, (9, 10, 5)>: 1
<9, (4, 10, 13)>: 1
<9, (6, 10, 9)>: 1
<10, (6, 8, 9)>: 1
<13, (1, 9, 12)>: 1
<14, (0, 11, 14)>: 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
