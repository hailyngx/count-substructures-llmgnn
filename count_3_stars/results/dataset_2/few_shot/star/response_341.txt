Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges. These nodes can be potential central nodes for the 3-stars. Based on the adjacency list, the potential central nodes are: Node 1, Node 9, Node 10, and Node 14.

Next, we will check each potential central node and identify 3-stars centered at them. 

At Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 0.
  - The 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (11, 4, 0)>
  
At Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 12.
  - Node 9 doesn't have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

At Node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 5.
  - The 3-star with Node 10 as the center: <10, (6, 4, 5)>

At Node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to node 3, and node 12.
  - Node 14 doesn't have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <1, (11, 4, 0)> and <10, (6, 4, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
