Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

The 3-star structures can be found by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <3, (7, 5, 15)>
2. <15, (5, 10, 11)>
3. <5, (3, 8, 15)>
4. <10, (2, 14, 15)>
5. <7, (0, 16, 3)>
6. <0, (17, 18, 19)>
7. <16, (1, 7, 17)>
8. <18, (0, 6, 13)>
9. <19, (0, 2, 6)>
10. <2, (10, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
