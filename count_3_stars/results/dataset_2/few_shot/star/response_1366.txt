Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
