Response:
Based on the given graph, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we see that the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
- Node 4 with neighbors 8, 0, 15
- Node 28 with neighbors 6, 3, 0
- Node 5 with neighbors 17, 20, 29
- Node 25 with neighbors 6, 15, 5

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:  
<4, (8, 0, 15)>  
<28, (6, 3, 0)>  
<5, (17, 20, 29)>  
<25, (6, 15, 5)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars gives us:
