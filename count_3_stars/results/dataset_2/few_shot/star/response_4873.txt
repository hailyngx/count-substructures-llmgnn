Response:
Based on the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will identify the 3-star configurations. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
   - Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 12, and 17 have less than three edges connected to them and hence cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.
   
2. Identify the nodes with three edges connected to them:
   - Nodes 2, 3, 6, 13, 14, and 15 have exactly three edges connected to them and can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.
   
3. Check the nodes connected to each of the potential central nodes from step 2:
   - For node 2: (2) - (1, 6, 14)
   - For node 3: (3) - (1, 6, 13)
   - For node 6: (6) - (3, 7, 5, 2, 19)
   - For node 13: (13) - (3, 18)
   - For node 14: (14) - (10, 2)
   - For node 15: (15) - (16, 17)
   
4. Count the number of 3-stars found:
   - From the above analysis, the unique 3-star configurations are:
     <2, (1, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 6, 13)>, <6, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 2, 19)>, <13, (3, 18)>, <14, (10, 2)>, <15, (16, 17)>
   - Count of 3-stars: [7]
