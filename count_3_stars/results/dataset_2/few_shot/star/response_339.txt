Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, 8, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, 8, and node 4

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges and adjacency lists. 

Calculating 3-star based on the edges:
- The central node of each 3-star can be any node in the graph.
- The leaves of each 3-star must be the nodes directly connected to the central node in a triangle pattern.

Based on the given edges, we can see that the 3-star patterns can be formed around nodes 0, 5, and 6. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 2)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
