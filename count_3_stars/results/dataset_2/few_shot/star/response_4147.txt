Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. The central node of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
2. The number of 3-stars depends on the number of such central nodes in the graph.
3. We will look for each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star.

Let's start examining each node:
- Node 0 has connections to 6, 5, 9, 4, 2, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <0, (5, 9, 4)>.
- Node 1 has connections to 5, 4, 8, 2, and 6. It forms one 3-star: <1, (5, 8, 2)>.
- Node 2 has connections to 9, 0, and 1. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has connections to 5, 4, 0, and 6. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has connections to 0, 1, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>.
- Node 5 has connections to 9, 8, 1, 0, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <5, (9, 8, 3)>.
- Node 6 has connections to 7, 0, 1, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <6, (7, 0, 1)>.
- Node 7 has connections to 9 and 6. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has connections to 5, 9, and 1. It forms one 3-star: <8, (5, 9, 1)>.
- Node 9 has connections to 5, 8, 2, 7, and 0. It forms one 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 2)>.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<6, (7, 0, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
