Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

From the given adjacency list and edge information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (8, 4, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
