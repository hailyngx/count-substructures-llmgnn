Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's count them step by step:

1. The center node 0 has 3 leaves: 6, 9. So, the 3-star is <0, (6, 9)>.
2. The center node 1 has 3 leaves: 5, 7, 9. So, the 3-star is <1, (5, 7, 9)>.
3. The center node 2 has 3 leaves: 5, 19, 6. So, the 3-star is <2, (5, 19, 6)>.
4. The center node 3 has 2 leaves: 9, 19. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 3.
5. The center node 4 has 2 leaves: 7, 15. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 4.
6. The center node 5 has 3 leaves: 1, 17, 19. So, the 3-star is <5, (1, 17, 19)>.
7. The center node 6 has 3 leaves: 2, 17, 19. So, the 3-star is <6, (2, 17, 19)>.
8. The center node 7 has 3 leaves: 1, 11, 4. So, the 3-star is <7, (1, 11, 4)>.
9. The center node 8 has 3 leaves: 5, 14, 18. So, the 3-star is <8, (5, 14, 18)>.
10. The center node 9 has 3 leaves: 0, 1, 12. So, the 3-star is <9, (0, 1, 12)>.
11. The center node 10 has 3 leaves: 16, 17, 8. So, the 3-star is <10, (16, 17, 8)>.
12. The center node 11 has 2 leaves: 7, 12. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 11.
13. The center node 12 has 3 leaves: 9, 11, 17. So, the 3-star is <12, (9, 11, 17)>.
14. The center node 13 has 2 leaves: 14, 18. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 13.
15. The center node 14 has 2 leaves: 8, 13. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 14.
16. The center node 15 has 3 leaves: 16, 4, 19. So, the 3-star is <15, (16, 4, 19)>.
17. The center node 16 has 2 leaves: 10, 15. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 16.
18. The center node 17 has 3 leaves: 10, 6, 12. So, the 3-star is <17, (10, 6, 12)>.
19. The center node 18 has 2 leaves: 13, 8. So, there's no 3-star centered at node 18.
20. The center node 19 has 3 leaves: 5, 15, 2. So, the 3-star is <19, (5, 15, 2)>.

Count of 3-stars: 10
