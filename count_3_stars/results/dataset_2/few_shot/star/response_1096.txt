Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10)

Node 10 is connected to node 9, 7, 12, 8, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 13, 14, 1, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 6, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, 4, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 11

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them one by one:

<3, (6, 5, 0)>
<4, (13, 3, 10)>
<5, (2, 13, 1)>
<6, (9, 14, 3)>
<7, (9, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<10, (9, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 13, 14)>
<13, (7, 2, 5)>
<14, (6, 2, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
