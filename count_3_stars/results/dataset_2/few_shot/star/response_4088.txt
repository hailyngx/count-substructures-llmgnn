Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 11, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 14, 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list out the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<5, (9, 13, 3)>
<9, (5, 14, 1)>
<1, (9, 10, 12)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<4, (3, 0, 11)>
<8, (0, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 2, 13)>
<2, (4, 0, 13)>
<11, (4, 12, 0)>
<12, (1, 6, 11)>
<7, (3, 8, 6)>
<13, (5, 9, 0)>
<14, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
