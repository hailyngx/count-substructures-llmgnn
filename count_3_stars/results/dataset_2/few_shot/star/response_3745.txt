Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can analyze the adjacency list of each node to identify any 3-stars.

Starting with the first node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 20, 15, and 6
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (8, 20, 15)> 
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (8, 20, 6)> 

Moving on to the sixth node:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 21, 0, and 3
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (21, 0, 3)> 

Continuing in this manner, we can identify and list all unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (8, 20, 15)>
<0, (8, 20, 6)>
<6, (21, 0, 3)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [3]
