Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (5, 25, 20)>
<1, (10, 23, 7)>
<4, (8, 24, 14)>
<8, (4, 17, 0)>
<10, (5, 1, 13)>
<11, (5, 12, 13)>
<12, (27, 20, 11)>
<14, (29, 24, 18)>
<15, (21, 14, 11)>
<16, (21, 22, 23)>
<17, (8, 25, 24)>
<19, (27, 25, 22)>
<20, (9, 12, 19)>
<21, (16, 15, 22)>
<22, (16, 19, 21)>
<23, (1, 12, 16)>
<24, (4, 17, 14)>
<26, (29, 0, 3)>
<27, (12, 3, 7)>
<28, (25, 10, 29)>

There are a total of 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [21].
