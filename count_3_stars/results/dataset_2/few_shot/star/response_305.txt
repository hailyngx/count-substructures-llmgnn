Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: <0, (5, 7, 2)>
Node 1: Does not form a 3-star
Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 3: <3, (9, 4, 6)>
Node 4: <4, (7, 6, 3)>
Node 5: Does not form a 3-star
Node 6: <6, (9, 4, 1)>
Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 0)>
Node 8: Does not form a 3-star
Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
