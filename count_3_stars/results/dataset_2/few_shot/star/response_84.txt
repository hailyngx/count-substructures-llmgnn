Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars for each central node separately and then summing them up.

Let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:
1. For Node 0:
- <0, (20, 24, 11)>
- <0, (20, 24, 26)>
These are the only 2 unique 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.

2. For Node 1:
- <1, (13, 19, 14)>
This is the only unique 3-star with Node 1 as the center.

3. For Node 3:
- <3, (13, 18, 5)>
There is only 1 unique 3-star with Node 3 as the center.

4. For Node 4:
- <4, (23, 28, 21)>
This is the only unique 3-star with Node 4 as the center.

5. For Node 6:
- <6, (23, 29, 25)>
This is the only unique 3-star with Node 6 as the center.

6. For Node 8:
- <8, (22, 23, 9)>

7. For Node 9:
- <9, (13, 8, 24)>
This is the only unique 3-star with Node 9 as the center.

8. For Node 10:
- <10, (12, 15, 2)>

9. For Node 11:
- <11, (0, 27, 20)>
- <11, (0, 27, 14)>
These are the only 2 unique 3-stars with Node 11 as the center.

10. For Node 13:
- <13, (22, 3, 1)>
- <13, (22, 3, 9)>
- <13, (22, 3, 14)>
- <13, (1, 19, 14)>
There are 4 unique 3-stars with Node 13 as the center.

Adding up the counts:
2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 10) + 2 (Node 11) + 4 (Node 13) = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
