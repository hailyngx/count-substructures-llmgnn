Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Each 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center. Let's go through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star by verifying if it has exactly three neighbors connected to it.

Here are the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (9, 8, 13)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (11, 7, 10)>
<3, (9, 1, 11)>
<4, (1, 11, 12)>
<5, (9, 8, 10)>
<6, (1, 11, 12)>
<7, (3, 11, 2)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<10, (5, 9, 14)>
<11, (9, 3, 6)>
<12, (6, 0, 4)>
<13, (1, 14, 0)>
<14, (1, 13, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [14]
