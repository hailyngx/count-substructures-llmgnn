Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0)

Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given graph, we can see that the central node in each 3-star can connect to only three other nodes. We will list all the potential 3-stars and then count how many unique 3-stars exist.

The potential 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (9, 6, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 0, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
