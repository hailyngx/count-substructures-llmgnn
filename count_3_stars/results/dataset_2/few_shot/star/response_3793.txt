Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 14 is connected to node 8, 6, 7, 0, 1, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 14)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars.
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: No 3-stars.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 8, 12)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 4, 12)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars.
- Node 8: No 3-stars.
- Node 9: No 3-stars.
- Node 10: No 3-stars.
- Node 11: No 3-stars.
- Node 12: No 3-stars.
- Node 13: No 3-stars.
- Node 14: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 7, 14)>
<6, (5, 4, 12)>
