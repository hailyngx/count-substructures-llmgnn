Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Examining the graph, we can find the following unique 3-stars: 
<3, (25, 20, 13)>
<25, (3, 6, 11)>
<7, (29, 19, 1)>
<21, (10, 4, 18)>
<8, (9, 16, 25)>
<17, (18, 0, 20)>
<22, (2, 17, 14)>
<0, (17, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
