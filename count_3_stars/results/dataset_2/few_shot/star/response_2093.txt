Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (15, 16, 13)>
<15, (3, 10, 18)>
<6, (15, 17, 14)>
<7, (2, 5, 1)>
<9, (8, 18, 11)>
<0, (4, 2, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<8, (9, 14, 0)>
<5, (7, 19, 1)>
<13, (3, 11, 14)>
<10, (15, 19, 1)>
<12, (9, 2, 18)>
<14, (6, 8, 13)>
<16, (3, 17, 1)>
<17, (15, 6, 16)>
<18, (15, 9, 12)>
<19, (5, 10, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
