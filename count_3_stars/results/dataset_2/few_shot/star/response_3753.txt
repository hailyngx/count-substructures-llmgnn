Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the 3-stars. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to check for 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (9,4,10)
2. Node 1: (6,2,14), (6,10,13), (6,10,1), (2,14,12), (14,2,1)
3. Node 2: (1,12,2), (1,14,10), (14,2,12)
4. Node 3: None
5. Node 4: (9,8,0)
6. Node 5: (9,7,14), (9,12,5), (7,5,14)
7. Node 6: (1,3,10), (1,10,13), (3,6,8), (6,8,10)
8. Node 7: (9,11,13), (7,11,13), (11,13,12)
9. Node 8: (4,6,10), (6,8,7)
10. Node 9: (5,7,14), (5,12,9), (7,9,14)
11. Node 10: (1,0,6), (1,6,13), (0,10,13)
12. Node 11: (3,7,13), (7,13,12)
13. Node 12: (5,1,13), (5,2,12), (1,12,2)
14. Node 13: (11,10,12)
15. Node 14: (5,1,2), (5,2,14), (1,14,12)

So, the identified 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 4, 10)>
<1, (6, 2, 14)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (2, 14, 12)>
<2, (1, 12, 2)>
<5, (9, 7, 14)>
<5, (9, 12, 5)>
<5, (7, 5, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 10)>
<6, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (9, 11, 13)>
<7, (7, 11, 13)>
<7, (11, 13, 12)>
<8, (4, 6, 10)>
<8, (6, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 14)>
<9, (5, 12, 9)>
<9, (7, 9, 14)>
<10, (1, 0, 6)>
<10, (1, 6, 13)>
<10, (0, 10, 13)>
<12, (5, 1, 13)>
<12, (5, 2, 12)>
<12, (1, 12, 2)>
<13, (11, 10, 12)>
<14, (5, 1, 2)>
<14, (5, 2, 14)>
<14, (1, 14, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
