Response:
The total number of 3-star in the given graph:

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars centered around that node:

1. Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (6, 28, 18)>
2. Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (21, 5, 19)> and <1, (21, 27, 25)>
3. Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (23, 29, 5)>
4. Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (15, 14, 10)>
5. Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (7, 12, 13)>
6. Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (24, 2, 10)>
7. Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (8, 0, 16)>
8. Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (22, 6, 11)>
9. Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (13, 12, 16)>
10. Node 10 forms one 3-star: <10, (26, 3, 5)>
11. Node 11 forms one 3-star: <11, (21, 8, 11)>
12. Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (22, 24, 4)>
13. Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (17, 9, 4)>
14. Node 15 forms one 3-star: <15, (17, 3, 14)>
15. Node 16 forms one 3-star: <16, (6, 9, 16)>
16. Node 17 forms one 3-star: <17, (15, 13, 9)>
17. Node 18 forms one 3-star: <18, (25, 21, 0)>
18. Node 19 forms one 3-star: <19, (1, 29, 27)>
19. Node 20 forms one 3-star: <20, (25, 26, 21)>
20. Node 21 forms one 3-star: <21, (11, 18, 8)>
21. Node 22 forms one 3-star: <22, (8, 12, 23)>
