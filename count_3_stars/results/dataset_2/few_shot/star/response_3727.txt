Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 3. <0, (4, 8, 3)>
Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 10, and 0. <1, (13, 10, 0)>
Node 2: No 3-star formed.
Node 3: No 3-star formed.
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 0. <4, (9, 7, 0)>
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 12. <5, (9, 13, 12)>
Node 6: No 3-star formed.
Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4. <7, (5, 9, 4)>
Node 8: No 3-star formed.
Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 4. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
Node 10: No 3-star formed.
Node 11: No 3-star formed.
Node 12: No 3-star formed.
Node 13: No 3-star formed.
Node 14: No 3-star formed.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 13, 12)>, and <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
