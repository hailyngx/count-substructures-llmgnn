Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify and count them. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 7: <7, (9, 1, 6)>
- Node 8: <8, (6, 4, 2)>
- Node 0: <0, (6, 4, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<7, (9, 1, 6)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
