Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<0, (18, 7, 12)>
<1, (10, 13, 3)>
<2, (17, 12, 14)>
<3, (10, 4, 8)>
<4, (10, 19, 3)>
<5, (14)>
<6, (11, 13, 16)>
<7, (0, 8, 18)>
<8, (11, 17, 3)>
<9, (4)>
<10, (16, 1, 3)>
<11, (16, 13, 6)>
<12, (13, 14, 2)>
<13, (11, 1, 10)>
<14, (17, 12, 5)>
<15, (17, 19, 15)>
<16, (11, 6, 10)>
<17, (14, 8, 15)>
<18, (0, 7, 19)>
<19, (15, 0, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
