Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
  1. <0, (12, 14, 17)>
  2. <1, (12, _, _)>
  3. <2, (18, 12, 19)>
  4. <3, (18, 13, 17)>
  5. <4, (18, 13, 11)>
  6. <5, (7, 16, _)>
  7. <6, (14, 13, 8)>
  8. <7, (12, 10, 9)>
  9. <8, (15, 6, _)>
  10. <9, (7, 15, 19)>
  11. <10, (7, 14, _)>
  12. <11, (18, 4, _)>
  13. <12, (2, 7, 0)>
  14. <13, (4, 17, 3)>
  15. <14, (0, 6, 19)>
  16. <15, (9, 8, _)>
  17. <16, (5, 3, 9)>
  18. <17, (0, 13, 3)>
  19. <18, (2, 4, 11)>
  20. <19, (2, 14, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we get [20].
