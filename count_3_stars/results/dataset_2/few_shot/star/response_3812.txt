Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are three unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (9, 8, 4)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
