Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given graph and adjacency list, we can see that the nodes involved in each 3-star are as follows:

1. Node 3: (13, 15, 14) <3, (13, 15, 14)>
2. Node 6: (1, 18, 11) <6, (1, 18, 11)>
3. Node 9: (17, 11, 12) <9, (17, 11, 12)>
4. Node 10: (13, 2, 4) <10, (13, 2, 4)>
5. Node 13: (3, 15, 14) <13, (3, 15, 14)>
6. Node 17: (15, 14, 11) <17, (15, 14, 11)>
7. Node 18: (1, 19, 6) <18, (1, 19, 6)>
8. Node 19: (18, 16, 12) <19, (18, 16, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
