Response:
Based on the given information, we need to find all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Node 5 is connected to 6, 27, 22, 15, and 20.
    - Node 18 is connected to 16, 9, 20, and 29.
    - Node 20 is connected to 5, 18, 26, 13, and 28.

2. Find all the 3-stars in the graph:
    - 3-star involving Node 5: 
        <5, (6, 27, 20)>
        <5, (6, 27, 15)>
        <5, (6, 27, 20)>
        <5, (6, 27, 20)>
        (Note: Duplicates are listed for completeness)

    - 3-star involving Node 18: 
        <18, (16, 9, 29)>
        <18, (16, 9, 20)>
        <18, (16, 20, 29)>
        <18, (9, 20, 29)>

    - 3-star involving Node 20: 
        <20, (5, 18, 26)>
        <20, (5, 18, 13)>
        <20, (5, 18, 28)>
        <20, (5, 26, 13)>
        <20, (5, 26, 28)>
        <20, (5, 13, 28)>
        <20, (18, 26, 13)>
        <20, (18, 26, 28)>
        <20, (18, 13, 28)>
        <20, (26, 13, 28)>

3. Now count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
    - Total unique 3-stars: [15]

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
