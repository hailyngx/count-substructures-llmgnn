Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every possible 3-star in the graph. 

Let's begin by identifying the nodes connected to each node, as they represent the leaves of the 3-stars centered at that node:

1. Node 0: (5, 12, 24)
2. Node 1: (17, 29, 10)
3. Node 2: (9, 27, 20)
4. Node 3: (15, 17, 24)
5. Node 4: (8, 12)
6. Node 5: (15, 6, 25, 0, 10)
7. Node 6: (9, 5, 22, 18, 23)
8. Node 7: (16, 8)
9. Node 8: (4, 7, 22, 18)
10. Node 9: (6, 2, 27, 23)
11. Node 10: (5, 1)
12. Node 11: (16, 24, 13, 25)
13. Node 12: (4, 0)
14. Node 13: (11, 28, 18)
15. Node 14: (22, 27)
16. Node 15: (3, 5)
17. Node 16: (11, 7, 22)
18. Node 17: (3, 29, 1, 27)
19. Node 18: (6, 8, 13)
20. Node 19: (28, 20)
21. Node 20: (26, 2, 19)
22. Node 21: (29, 24, 23)
23. Node 22: (16, 6, 8, 14)
24. Node 23: (6, 9, 21)
25. Node 24: (11, 3, 0, 21)
26. Node 25: (11, 5)
27. Node 26: (20)
28. Node 27: (9, 17, 2, 14)
29. Node 28: (19, 13)
30. Node 29: (17, 1, 21)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by considering each node as the center of the star:

<0, (5, 12, 24)>
<1, (17, 29, 10)>
<2, (9, 27, 20)>
<3, (15, 17, 24)>
<4, (8, 12)>
<5, (15, 6, 25)>
<6, (9, 22, 18)>
<7, (16, 22, 8)>
<8, (22, 18, 16)>
<9, (27, 2, 6)>
<10, (1, 5, 29)>
<11, (24, 13, 25)>
<12, (0, 4)>
<13, (28, 18)>
<14, (22, 27)>
<15, (5, 3)>
<16, (22, 7)>
<17, (29, 1)>
<18, (22, 13)>
<19, (20, 28)>
<20, (2, 26)>
<21, (29, 24)>
<22, (8, 16)>
<23, (9, 21)>
<24, (0, 3)>
<25, (11, 5)>
<26, (20)>
<27, (17, 9)>
<28, (19, 13)>
<29, (21, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
