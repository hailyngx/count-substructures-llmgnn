Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star configuration. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (7, 10, 3)>
<1, (8, 14, 11)>
<2, (7, 1, 14)>
<3, (8, 5, 11)>
<4, (5, 12, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<7, (0, 12, 2)>
<8, (9, 5, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<10, (6, 9, 5)>
<11, (14, 12, 3)>
<12, (9, 13, 0)>
<13, (6, 9, 12)>
<14, (8, 11, 1)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [14].
