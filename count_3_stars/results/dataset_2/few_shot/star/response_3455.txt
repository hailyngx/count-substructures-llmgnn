Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 14, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 14, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 14, 5, 13, 11, 6, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 14, 5, 11, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 4, 3, 10, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 3, 12, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, 5, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 1, 9, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 0, 13, 3, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 14, 12)>
<1, (11, 4, 12)>
<2, (8, 14, 7)>
<3, (14, 5, 12)>
<4, (14, 5, 11)>
<5, (13, 4, 10)>
<6, (8, 3, 12)>
<7, (2, 8, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 6)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<10, (5, 7, 0)>
<11, (3, 1, 9)>
<12, (0, 13, 3)>
<13, (5, 12, 3)>
<14, (2, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
