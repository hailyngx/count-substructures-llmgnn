Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<1, (6, 3, 11)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<4, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<7, (5, 3, 10)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<10, (3, 7, 12)>
<12, (3, 10, 11)>
<13, (9, 4, 10)>
<14, (6, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
