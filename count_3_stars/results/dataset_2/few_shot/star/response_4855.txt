Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 6. <4, (10, 11, 6)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 11, and 1. <7, (0, 11, 1)>
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 13. <10, (4, 1, 13)>
4. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 14. <11, (4, 7, 14)>
5. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 8. <13, (10, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
