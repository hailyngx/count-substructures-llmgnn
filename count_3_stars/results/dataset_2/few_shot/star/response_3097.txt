Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected in a star-like pattern.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (6, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
