Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 14, 11, 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 14, 13, 12, 10, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 14, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, 8, 12, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 12, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 3, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 2, 12, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 13, 1, 2, 10, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 12, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 2

Response:
There are only two 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<12, (5, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
