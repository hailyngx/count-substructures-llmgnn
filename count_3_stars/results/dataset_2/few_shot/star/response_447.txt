Response:
The nodes that form 3-stars are those nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these nodes first:
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 29, 27, 23, 19
- Node 26 is connected to 2 nodes: 6, 27
- Node 4 is connected to 5 nodes: 7, 3, 5, 17, 2
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 12, 23
- Node 10 is connected to 4 nodes: 17, 3, 1, 16
- Node 13 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 19, 6
- Node 12 is connected to 3 nodes: 7, 0, 23
- Node 15 is connected to 3 nodes: 21, 11, 18
- Node 16 is connected to 3 nodes: 10, 17, 25
- Node 18 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 15, 25
- Node 19 is connected to 4 nodes: 9, 13, 24, 20
- Node 20 is connected to 3 nodes: 28, 2, 19
- Node 21 is connected to 3 nodes: 28, 8, 15
- Node 22 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 11, 3
- Node 23 is connected to 3 nodes: 9, 7, 12
- Node 25 is connected to 4 nodes: 28, 27, 16, 18
- Node 27 is connected to 4 nodes: 9, 26, 28, 25
- Node 28 is connected to 4 nodes: 21, 27, 25, 20

Now, let's find the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their associated leaves:
- <9, (29, 27, 23)>
- <10, (17, 3, 1)>
- <12, (7, 0, 23)>
- <15, (21, 11, 18)>
- <16, (10, 17, 25)>
- <18, (1, 15, 25)>
- <19, (9, 13, 24)>
- <20, (28, 2, 19)>
- <21, (28, 8, 15)>
- <22, (2, 11, 3)>
- <25, (28, 27, 16)>
- <27, (9, 26, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12.  
So, the final answer is [12].
