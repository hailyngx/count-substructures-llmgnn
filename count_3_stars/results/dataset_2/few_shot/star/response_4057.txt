Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to find 3-stars:

1. From Node 0: 
   <0, (14, 17, 10)>

2. From Node 1:
   <1, (17, 8, 12)>
   <1, (17, 8, 7)>

3. From Node 2:
   <2, (10, 19, 4)>

4. From Node 3:
   No 3-stars found.

5. From Node 4:
   <4, (17, 5, 16)>
   <4, (17, 16, 2)>

6. From Node 5:
   No 3-stars found.

7. From Node 6:
   No 3-stars found.

8. From Node 7:
   <7, (1, 19, 3)>

9. From Node 8:
   <8, (17, 10, 1)>
   <8, (17, 1, 19)>
   <8, (17, 10, 19)>

10. From Node 9:
   No 3-stars found.

11. From Node 10:
   <10, (6, 11, 0)>
   <10, (6, 2, 0)>
   <10, (6, 2, 8)>

12. From Node 11:
   No 3-stars found.

13. From Node 12:
   No 3-stars found.

14. From Node 13:
   No 3-stars found.

15. From Node 14:
   No 3-stars found.

16. From Node 15:
   No 3-stars found.

17. From Node 16:
   No 3-stars found.

18. From Node 17:
   <17, (1, 0, 8)>
   <17, (1, 4, 8)>
   <17, (1, 4, 0)>

19. From Node 18:
   No 3-stars found.

20. From Node 19:
   No 3-stars found.

Therefore, the count of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (14, 17, 10)>, <1, (17, 8, 12)>, <1, (17, 8, 7)>, <2, (10, 19, 4)>, <4, (17, 5, 16)>, <4, (17, 16, 2)>, <7, (1, 19, 3)>, <8, (17, 10, 1)>, <8, (17, 1, 19)>.
