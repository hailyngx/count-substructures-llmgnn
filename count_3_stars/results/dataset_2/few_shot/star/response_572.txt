Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 3, and 8. <0, (9, 3, 8)>
  
Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 2, and 5. <1, (6, 2, 5)>
  
Checking Node 2:
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star.
  
For Node 3:
- Node 3 doesn't form any 3-star.
  
Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 also doesn't form any 3-star.
  
Now for Node 5:
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 3, and 7. <5, (6, 3, 7)>
  
Proceeding with Node 6:
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 1, and 8. <6, (9, 1, 8)>
  
Now for Node 7:
- Node 7 doesn't form any 3-star.
  
Checking Node 8:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 0. <8, (6, 4, 0)>
  
Lastly, for Node 9:
- Node 9 doesn't form any 3-star.
  
Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found a total of [4] unique 3-stars.
