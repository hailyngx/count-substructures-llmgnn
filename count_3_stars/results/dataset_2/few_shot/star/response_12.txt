Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a star pattern. 

Based on the given information, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (9, 1, 10)>
<2, (7, 8, 14)>
<4, (13, 1, 3)>
<6, (10, 11, 8)>
<12, (9, 3, 0)>
