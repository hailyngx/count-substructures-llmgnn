Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 15, 0, and 2. <3, (15, 0, 2)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 8, and 12. <15, (3, 8, 12)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 0, and 11. <14, (17, 0, 11)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 17, 9, and 5. <6, (17, 9, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 18, and 0. <4, (8, 18, 0)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 11, and 8. <10, (9, 11, 8)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 15, 17, and 11. <12, (15, 17, 11)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves 16, 7, and 1. <18, (16, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
