Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the provided adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the central nodes for the 3-stars.
   - Nodes 8 and 12 meet this criterion.

2. For each central node found in step 1, we need to identify the three nodes connected to them by edges, which will form the 3-stars.

For Central Node 8:
- <8, (9, 4, 10)>
- <8, (9, 14, 12)>
- <8, (9, 4, 12)>
- <8, (4, 10, 14)>
- <8, (4, 10, 12)>

For Central Node 12:
- <12, (6, 1, 8)>
- <12, (6, 1, 0)>
- <12, (6, 8, 14)>
- <12, (1, 8, 14)>
- <12, (1, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (9, 4, 10)>
<8, (9, 14, 12)>
<8, (9, 4, 12)>
<8, (4, 10, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 12)>
<12, (6, 1, 8)>
<12, (6, 1, 0)>
<12, (6, 8, 14)>
<12, (1, 8, 14)>
<12, (1, 8, 0)>
