Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list down the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<4, (0, 7, 11)>
<5, (7, 14, 15)>
<6, (1, 15, 19)>
<8, (3, 10, 13)>
<9, (7, 11, 18)>
<12, (13, 14, 17)>
<16, (0, 17, 16)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
