Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 6, 13)>
<6, (3, 1, 8)>
<10, (1, 4, 2)>
<16, (6, 13, 19)>
<0, (17, 18, 4)>
<5, (15, 11, 16)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
