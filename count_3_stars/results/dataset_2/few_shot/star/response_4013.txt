Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (15, 11, 14)>
<2, (15, 11, 12)>
<4, (15, 7, -)>
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<9, (6, 2, 19)>
<10, (7, 11, 5)>
<11, (1, 6, 12)>
<12, (15, 11, 2)>
<14, (1, 7, 18)>
<15, (1, 4, 2)>
<16, (13, 0, 5)>
<18, (8, 17, 19)>
<19, (9, 18, -)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [15]
