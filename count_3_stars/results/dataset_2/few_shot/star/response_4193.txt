Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Start by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:  
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 8, 13, and 11.  
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 13, 8, and 17.  

2. Next, find the 3-stars centered at the identified nodes:

3-stars centered at node 5:  
- <5, (8, 11, 13)>
 
3-stars centered at node 10:  
- <10, (13, 8, 17)>
  
[Total number of 3-stars: 2]  
[<5, (8, 11, 13)>, <10, (13, 8, 17)>]
