Response:
Initially, we will identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Based on the adjacency list, the possible 3-star configurations (center node and leaf nodes) are as follows:
- Node 0 is the center with leaves 5, 1, 12
- Node 1 is the center with leaves 3, 11, 2
- Node 2 is the center with leaves 5, 1, 10
- Node 3 is the center with leaves 4, 1, 14
- Node 4 is the center with leaves 9, 7, 13
- Node 5 is the center with leaves 9, 6, 14
- Node 6 is the center with leaves 5, 7, 10
- Node 7 is the center with leaves 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 is the center with leaves 9, 7, 6
- Node 9 is the center with leaves 5, 8, 4
- Node 10 is the center with leaves 3, 6, 2
- Node 11 is the center with leaves 4, 1, 14
- Node 12 is the center with leaves 6, 0, 14
- Node 13 is the center with leaves 4, 0, 10
- Node 14 is the center with leaves 5, 3, 11

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 1, 12)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<2, (5, 1, 10)>
<3, (4, 1, 14)>
<4, (9, 7, 13)>
<5, (9, 6, 14)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<10, (3, 6, 2)>
<11, (4, 1, 14)>
<12, (6, 0, 14)>
<13, (4, 0, 10)>
<14, (5, 3, 11)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
