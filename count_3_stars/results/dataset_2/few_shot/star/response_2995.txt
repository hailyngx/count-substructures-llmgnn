Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them uniquely, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Determine 3-stars based on the identified nodes as centers.

Let's start with step 1:
Nodes with exactly 3 connections: 6 and 8

Now, letâ€™s list the 3-stars based on the identified nodes as centers (6 and 8):
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<6, (5, 0, 3)>

<8, (7, 2, 1)>
<8, (7, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 2, 4)>

[There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.]
