Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star configurations. A 3-star configuration consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming edges between them. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we can list the 3-stars in the following way:
<11, (16, 7, 13)>
<16, (11, 0, 13)>
<13, (11, 1, 19)>
<4, (14, 0, 9)>
<9, (16, 8, 15)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
[5]
