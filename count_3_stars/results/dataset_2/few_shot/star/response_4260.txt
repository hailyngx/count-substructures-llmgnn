Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the given graph, we can see that there are some nodes that form 3-star patterns. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
