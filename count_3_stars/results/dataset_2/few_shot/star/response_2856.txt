Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list and edge connections, we can see that the 3-stars are formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<7, (12, 10, 1)>
<10, (4, 7, 11)>
<11, (7, 1, 9)>
<5, (6, 12, -)>
<6, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (7, 6, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
