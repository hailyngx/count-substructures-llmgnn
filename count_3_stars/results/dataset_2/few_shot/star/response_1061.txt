Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

1. Let's first find all the 3-stars based on the given information:
- From the adjacency list, we can identify the possible 3-stars involving each node:
    - Node 0: <0, (5, 11, 19)>
    - Node 1: <1, (9, 12, 13)>
    - Node 2: <2, (6, 14)>
    - Node 3: <3, (4, 6, 17)>
    - Node 4: <4, (3, 6, 9)>
    - Node 5: <5, (0, 11, 19)>
    - Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 10)>, <6, (4, 10, 12)>, <6, (13, 16, 2)>
    - Node 7: No 3-star
    - Node 8: <8, (4, 15, 19)>
    - Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 12)>
    - Node 10: <10, (6, 17, 18)>
    - Node 11: <11, (0, 5, 13)>
    - Node 12: <12, (1, 6, 9)>
    - Node 13: <13, (1, 11, 16)>
    - Node 14: <14, (2, 11, 15)>
    - Node 15: <15, (8, 14, 17)>
    - Node 16: <16, (7, 13, 18)>
    - Node 17: <17, (3, 10, 15)>
    - Node 18: <18, (10, 16, 17)>
    - Node 19: <19, (0, 8, 15)>

2. Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- By listing all the unique 3-stars found, we get:
<0, (5, 11, 19)>, <1, (9, 12, 13)>, <2, (6, 14)>, <3, (4, 6, 17)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 15, 19)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>, <10, (6, 17, 18)>, <11, (0, 5, 13)>, <12, (1, 6, 9)>, <13, (1, 11, 16)>, <14, (2, 11, 15)>, <15, (8, 14, 17)>, <16, (7, 13, 18)>, <17, (3, 10, 15)>, <18, (10, 16, 17)>, <19, (0, 8, 15)>
- Count of unique 3-stars: [16]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
