Node 17 is connected to node 4
Node 18 is connected to node 3, 2, 19, and node 15
Node 19 is connected to node 3, 18, 5, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with 3 edges.
Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 4 connected to nodes 19, 17, and 10
- Node 12 connected only to node 5
- Node 17 connected only to node 4

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars involving these nodes.
Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves, we will look for 3-stars involving the nodes identified in Step 1.

- For Node 4: 
    - <4, (19, 17, 10)>
- For Node 12:
    - No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- For Node 17:
    - No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
<4, (19, 17, 10)>

Step 4: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
The total number of unique 3-stars found is 1.
