Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 11 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 14, 5, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the unique cases where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<1, (9, 11, 5)>
<2, (4, 14, 11)>
<3, (13, 8, 6)>
<4, (6, 13, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 13, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 14)>
<8, (6, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 14, 10)>
<10, (13, 7, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above: [10].
