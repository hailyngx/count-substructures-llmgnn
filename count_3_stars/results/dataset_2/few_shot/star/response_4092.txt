Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (8, 1, 10)>
<0, (8, 1, 19)>
<0, (8, 10, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 10)>
<0, (1, 7, 17)>
<0, (10, 0, 19)>
<0, (10, 7, 1)>
<0, (10, 7, 17)>
<0, (19, 0, 10)>
<0, (19, 11, 5)>
<1, (7, 17, 3)>
<1, (7, 17, 14)>
<1, (14, 12, 5)>
<1, (14, 12, 16)>
<2, (0, 10, 7)>
<2, (0, 10, 19)>
<2, (10, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 15, 6)>
<5, (11, 18, 16)>
<5, (11, 18, 5)>
<5, (14, 12, 1)>
<5, (14, 12, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (15, 9, 3)>
<6, (15, 9, 18)>
<7, (8, 10, 0)>
<7, (8, 10, 2)>
<9, (3, 11, 19)>
