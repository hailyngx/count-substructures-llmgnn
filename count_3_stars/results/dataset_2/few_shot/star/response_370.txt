Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list the 3-star configurations we find in the graph:
<0, (11, 5, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (18, 19, 14)>
<3, (1, 9, 12)>
<4, (10, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 0, 14)>
<6, (1, 17, 6)>
<7, (15, 9, 7)>
<8, (10, 0, 12)>
<9, (7, 3, 12)>
<10, (4, 8, 15)>
<11, (0, 17, 11)>
<12, (1, 3, 8)>
<13, (16, 12, 13)>
<14, (16, 2, 5)>
<15, (10, 7, 15)>
<16, (13, 14, 16)>
<17, (11, 6, 19)>
<18, (18, 2, 3)>
<19, (17, 2, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
