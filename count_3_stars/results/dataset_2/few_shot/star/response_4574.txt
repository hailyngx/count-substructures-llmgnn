Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking through the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<13, (22, 17, 21)>
<15, (0, 12, 16)>
<9, (20, 24, 7)>
<1, (5, 28, 6)>
<12, (15, 8, 0)>
<4, (20, 2, 19)>
<5, (2, 19, 25)>
<8, (2, 10, 12)>
<3, (11, 7, 0)>
<11, (3, 17, 26)>
<14, (19, 23, 4)>
<23, (26, 19, 29)>
<18, (10, 27, 6)>
<27, (16, 18, 0)>
<0, (22, 15, 12)>
<2, (8, 21, 5)>
<7, (3, 9, 29)>
<6, (19, 1, 25)>
<17, (13, 11, 26)>
<19, (5, 14, 6)>
<20, (9, 4, 0)>
<21, (13, 26, 5)>
<16, (15, 27, 0)>
<10, (8, 18, 0)>
<24, (9)>
<25, (5, 1, 6)>
<26, (23, 21, 17)>
<28, (13, 1)>
<29, (0, 23)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [29] 3-stars.
