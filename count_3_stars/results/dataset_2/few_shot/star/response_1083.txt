Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, and node 1

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
   - Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 9.
   - Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 8.
   - Node 3: Does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, 8.
   - Node 5: Forms two 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, 7 and nodes 2, 3, 4. 
   - Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8: Does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 7.

2. Count the unique 3-stars:
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
   - Total = 5
