Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's list the 3-stars (central node, leaf nodes) present in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found.
