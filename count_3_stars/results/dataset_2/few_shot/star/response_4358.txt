Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<15, (3, 14, 17)>
<5, (6, 14, 19)>
<6, (5, 10, 12)>
<4, (6, 11, 18)>
<14, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 2, 14)>
<16, (5, 10, 12)>
<11, (4, 7, 17)>
<18, (4, 15, 19)>
<12, (1, 6, 16)>
<13, (1, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

[12]
