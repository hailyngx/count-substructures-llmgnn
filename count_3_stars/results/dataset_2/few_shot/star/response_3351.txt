Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 16. It acts as the center node.
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 16, and 18. It acts as the center node.
3. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 17. It acts as the center node.
4. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 15. It acts as the center node.
5. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 18, and 19. It acts as the center node.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are 2 instances of the first pattern, 1 instance of the second pattern, 1 instance of the third pattern, 1 instance of the fourth pattern, and 1 instance of the fifth pattern.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 13, 16)>
<4, (12, 16, 18)>
<9, (10, 11, 17)>
<12, (2, 11, 15)>
<16, (4, 18, 19)>
