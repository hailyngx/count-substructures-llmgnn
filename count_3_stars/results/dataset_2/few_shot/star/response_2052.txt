Response:
As a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify each 3-star by looking at nodes connected to each node. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: Degree = 4 (Edges with nodes 9, 10, 11, and 8)
   - Node 1: Degree = 5 (Edges with nodes 5, 7, 3, 13, and 8)
   - Node 2: Degree = 2 (Edges with nodes 7 and 3)
   - Node 3: Degree = 3 (Edges with nodes 1, 13, and 2)
   - Node 4: Degree = 3 (Edges with nodes 7, 12, and 6)
   - Node 5: Degree = 3 (Edges with nodes 9, 1, and 11)
   - Node 6: Degree = 3 (Edges with nodes 4, 12, and 13)
   - Node 7: Degree = 5 (Edges with nodes 4, 12, 11, 2, and 1)
   - Node 8: Degree = 4 (Edges with nodes 1, 12, 14, and 0)
   - Node 9: Degree = 5 (Edges with nodes 5, 14, 10, 13, and 0)
   - Node 10: Degree = 4 (Edges with nodes 9, 11, 0, and 13)
   - Node 11: Degree = 4 (Edges with nodes 5, 7, 10, and 0)
   - Node 12: Degree = 5 (Edges with nodes 4, 7, 14, 6, and 8)
   - Node 13: Degree = 6 (Edges with nodes 9, 1, 3, 10, 6, and 14)
   - Node 14: Degree = 4 (Edges with nodes 9, 12, 8, and 13)

2. List all possible 3-stars:
   - <0, (9, 10, 8)>  (Central node 0 with leaves 9, 10, 8)
   - <1, (5, 7, 3)>    (Central node 1 with leaves 5, 7, 3)
   - <2, (7, 3, 1)>    (Central node 2 with leaves 7, 3, 1)
   - <3, (1, 13, 2)>   (Central node 3 with leaves 1, 13, 2)
   - <4, (7, 12, 6)>   (Central node 4 with leaves 7, 12, 6)
   - <5, (9, 1, 11)>   (Central node 5 with leaves 9, 1, 11)
   - <6, (4, 12, 13)>  (Central node 6 with leaves 4, 12, 13)
   - <7, (4, 12, 11)>  (Central node 7 with leaves 4, 12, 11)
   - <8, (1, 12, 14)>  (Central node 8 with leaves 1, 12, 14)
   - <9, (5, 14, 10)>  (Central node 9 with leaves 5, 14, 10)

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
