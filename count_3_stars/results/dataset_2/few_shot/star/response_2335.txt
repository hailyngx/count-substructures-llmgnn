Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 14, 1, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 8, 0, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 10, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 4, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 14, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 12, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 10, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 14, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 11, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 6, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 13, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 0, 12, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of those 3-stars:

<5, (9, 12, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<10, (11, 7, 2)>
<4, (11, 14, 3)>
<0, (9, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
