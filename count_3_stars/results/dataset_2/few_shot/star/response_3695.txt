Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 6, 2, 10, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 12, 11, 0, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 11, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 5, 12, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, 12, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 11, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 13, 3, 11, 10, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 13, 0, 1, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 1, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 9, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (13, 6, 1)>
2. <1, (8, 12, 0)>
3. <3, (8, 5, 12)>
4. <4, (7, 8, 10)>
5. <5, (7, 8, 6)>
6. <6, (7, 5, 11)>
7. <7, (4, 12, 11)>
8. <8, (4, 5, 3)>
9. <9, (13, 11, 10)>
10. <10, (4, 13, 0)>
11. <11, (7, 6, 2)>
12. <12, (7, 5, 3)>
13. <13, (10, 9, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
