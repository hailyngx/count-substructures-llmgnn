Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (18, 6, 9)>
<1, (17, 11, 9)>
<2, (8, 4, 10)>
<3, (8, 17, 16)>
<4, (2, 15, -)>
<5, (6, 16, 7)>
<8, (2, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 9, 14)>
<12, (9, 14, -)>
<13, (15, 19, -)>
<14, (12, 11, 3)>
<15, (13, 4, -)>
<16, (18, 6, 3)>
<17, (1, 3, 19)>
<18, (16, 0, 7)>
<19, (17, 7, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars: [16]
