Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify all the 3-stars found in the graph:

- <1, (17, 13, 12)>
- <3, (9, 8, 0)>
- <5, (28, 22, 14)>
- <6, (8, 26, 15)>
- <7, (0, 21, 27)>
- <11, (25, 13, 23)>
- <16, (18, 16, 19)>
- <24, (25, 18, 14)>
- <27, (15, 21, 2)>
- <29, (20, 22, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
