Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the given information. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the nodes 1, 4, and 7 each have connections to 3 other nodes, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's analyze these three nodes: 
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 8. This means that potential 3-stars with node 1 as the center could be formed with the neighbor nodes.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 3. This also provides the opportunity to form 3-stars with node 4 at the center.
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 2, 8, 1. Similar to nodes 1 and 4, node 7 can be the center of 3-stars as well.

Now, let's search for all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- From Node 1:  
<1, (5, 9, 7)>  
<1, (5, 9, 3)>  
<1, (5, 9, 2)>  
<1, (5, 9, 8)>  
<1, (5, 7, 3)>  
<1, (5, 7, 2)>  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<1, (9, 7, 3)>  
<1, (9, 7, 2)>  
<1, (9, 7, 8)>  
<1, (9, 3, 2)>  
<1, (9, 3, 8)>  
<1, (9, 2, 8)>  
<1, (7, 3, 2)>  
<1, (7, 3, 8)>  
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
  
- From Node 4:  
<4, (9, 7, 8)>  
<4, (9, 7, 3)>  
<4, (9, 8, 3)>  
<4, (7, 8, 3)>  
  
- From Node 7:  
<7, (4, 0, 2)>  
<7, (4, 0, 8)>  
<7, (4, 2, 8)>  
<7, (0, 2, 8)>  
<7, (0, 2, 1)>  
  
Counting the total unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [25] 3-stars in the given graph.
