Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the graph. 
A 3-star is formed by selecting a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with (26, 28, 23).
2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with (21, 14, 8).
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with (17, 25, 27).
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 7).
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star.
11. Node 10 does not form a 3-star.
12. Node 11 does not form a 3-star.
13. Node 12 does not form a 3-star.
14. Node 13 does not form a 3-star.
15. Node 14 does not form a 3-star.
16. Node 15 forms a 3-star with (21, 6, 28).
17. Node 16 does not form a 3-star.
18. Node 17 forms a 3-star with (20, 13, 4).
19. Node 18 does not form a 3-star.
20. Node 19 does not form a 3-star.
21. Node 20 does not form a 3-star.
22. Node 21 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 22).
23. Node 22 does not form a 3-star.
24. Node 23 does not form a 3-star.
25. Node 24 does not form a 3-star.
26. Node 25 forms a 3-star with (14, 20, 4).
27. Node 26 does not form a 3-star.
28. Node 27 does not form a 3-star.
29. Node 28 does not form a 3-star.
30. Node 29 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (26, 28, 23)>
<3, (21, 14, 8)>
<4, (17, 25, 27)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<15, (21, 6, 28)>
<17, (20, 13, 4)>
<25, (14, 20, 4)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
