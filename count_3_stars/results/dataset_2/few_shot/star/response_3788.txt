Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 14, and 19: <1, (3, 14, 19)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 18: <2, (6, 11, 18)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 17: <4, (6, 11, 17)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 19, and 9: <5, (17, 19, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 12, and 16: <6, (2, 12, 16)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 12, and 14: <7, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 11, and 2: <8, (3, 11, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 19, and 14: <9, (13, 19, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 16, and 18: <10, (12, 16, 18)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 13: <18, (2, 10, 13)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <19, (1, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-star graphs identified above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
