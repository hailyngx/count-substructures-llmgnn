Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Based on the given adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0.
- Node 1: <1, (3, 2, 13)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 7, 13)>
- Node 4: No 3-star centered at node 4.
- Node 5: No 3-star centered at node 5.
- Node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6.
- Node 7: No 3-star centered at node 7.
- Node 8: <8, (1, 13, 9)>
- Node 9: No 3-star centered at node 9.
- Node 10: No 3-star centered at node 10.
- Node 11: No 3-star centered at node 11.
- Node 12: <12, (8, 13, 5)>
- Node 13: <13, (1, 8, 12)>
- Node 14: No 3-star centered at node 14.

2. Counting the identified 3-stars:
- Total number of unique 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 2, 13)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 13, 9)>
