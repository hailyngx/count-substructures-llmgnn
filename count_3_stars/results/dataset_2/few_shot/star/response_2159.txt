Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Let's list the 3-stars:
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<5, (6, 2, 3)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 0, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 5)>
<1, (8, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
