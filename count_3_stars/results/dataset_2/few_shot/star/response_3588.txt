Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 18, and 5. So, <4, (16, 18, 5)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 13, and 9. So, <10, (16, 13, 9)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 12 is connected to nodes 19, 2, and 13. So, <12, (19, 2, 13)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 17. So, <1, (4, 14, 17)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 15. So, <8, (11, 17, 15)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [5].
