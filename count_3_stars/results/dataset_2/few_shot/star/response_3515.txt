Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 16, 23, 0
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 25, 29, 15
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 25, 2, 24
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 20, 28, 12
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 13, 9, 21
- Node 10 has only 1 neighbor, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 2, 21, 18
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 6, 9, 0
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 14 has only 1 neighbor, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 17, 28, 1
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 9, 24, 11
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 8, 15, 11
- Node 22 has only 1 neighbor, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 0, 18, 5
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 5, 26, 4
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 27 has only 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star

Now, let's define the 3-stars found:
<1, (16, 23, 0)>
<4, (25, 29, 15)>
<5, (25, 2, 24)>
<6, (20, 28, 12)>
<8, (13, 9, 21)>
<11, (2, 21, 18)>
<12, (6, 9, 0)>
<16, (17, 28, 1)>
<18, (9, 24, 11)>
<24, (0, 18, 5)>
<25, (5, 26, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
