Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (2, 8) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 9) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 19) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 0) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 13) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 6) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 9)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<3, (15, 9, 19)>
<7, (5, 12, 19)>
<12, (17, 16, 19)>
<1, (18, 13, 4)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [4].
