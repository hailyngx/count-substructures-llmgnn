Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are at the center of a 3-star in the given graph. These nodes will be connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the provided adjacency list, the following nodes meet this criteria: 4, 7, 10, 13.

Next, for each of these nodes, let's identify the three nodes connected to them to form a 3-star structure:

For node 4:
<4, (1, 18, 16)>
<4, (7, 18, 1)>
<4, (7, 16, 18)>
<4, (7, 1, 16)>

For node 7:
<7, (10, 15, 4)>
<7, (10, 8, 4)>
<7, (8, 4, 15)>
<7, (8, 10, 4)>

For node 10:
<10, (8, 17, 7)>
<10, (8, 3, 7)>
<10, (8, 4, 7)>
<10, (8, 7, 3)>

For node 13:
<13, (0, 12, 17)>
<13, (0, 17, 6)>
<13, (0, 6, 12)>
<13, (12, 17, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
