Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see the following 3-star patterns:
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The total number of 3-stars is: [7]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
