Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present.

As defined, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given graph and the adjacency list, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

<0, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<7, (9, 6, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [10].
