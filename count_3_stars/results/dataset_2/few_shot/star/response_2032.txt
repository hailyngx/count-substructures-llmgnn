Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, making it a central node of a 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 11, 1)>
<3, (11, 12, 4)>
<4, (9, 12, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<6, (10, 11, 1)>
<7, (10, 14, 12)>
<8, (7, 11, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<10, (7, 6, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
