Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The central node and its adjacent nodes can form a 3-star if:
1. The central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. Each of the 3 other nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Let's find the 3-stars present by checking each node:
1. Node 0 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
2. Node 1 can form 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 8), (4, 6, 8), and (6, 7, 9).
3. Node 2 can form 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 8), (4, 6, 8), and (6, 7, 9).
4. Node 3 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
5. Node 4 can form 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 8) and (6, 7, 9).
6. Node 5 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
7. Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 8), (1, 4, 8), and (4, 7, 9).
8. Node 7 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
9. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 4) and (6, 7, 9).
10. Node 9 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 4)>
<1, (2, 8, 6)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
