Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

    1. Nodes with 3 connections:
        - Node 0: [1, 16]
        - Node 2: [5, 6, 14]
        - Node 4: [19, 6]
        - Node 9: [1, 7]
        - Node 10: [16, 8]
        - Node 12: [11, 5]
        - Node 13: [3]
        - Node 17: [18]

    2. Three-star structures:
        <1, (0, 3, 16)>
        <2, (5, 6, 14)>
        <4, (19, 6, 11)>
        <7, (14, 9, 1)>
        <8, (16, 10, 18)>
        <12, (11, 5, 18)>
        <13, (3, 1, 11)>
        <17, (18, 14, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
