Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers for 3-stars.

Potential centers: 
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 0, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 3, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to 5, 4, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to 6, 7, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to 10, 2, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to 5, 4, and 10.
- Node 8 is connected to 5, 1, and 13.
- Node 12 is connected to 6, 1, and 8.

Step 2: For each potential center, check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.

3-star combinations: 
- <5, (1, 0, 3)>
- <4, (6, 7, 13)>
- <12, (6, 1, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Total 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <5, (1, 0, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 13)>, and <12, (6, 1, 8)>.
