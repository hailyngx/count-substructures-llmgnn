Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars based on the given information.

For each node, we will check its neighbors and see if there is a 3-star centered around that node. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 1. There is no 3-star centered around Node 0 since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, and 13. There is no 3-star centered around Node 1 since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

Continuing this process for Nodes 2 to 14, we find that the following nodes are at the center of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 14.
- Node 5 has a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 13.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (9, 2, 14)>, <5, (10, 11, 13)>.

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get [2].
