Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 3: <6, (9, 7, 3)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 7, and 6: <9, (8, 7, 6)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, and 5: <1, (3, 2, 5)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 7: <3, (6, 1, 7)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 0, and 5: <4, (7, 0, 5)>
6. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <0, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
