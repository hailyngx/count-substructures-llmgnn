Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:
1. Calculate the degree of each node:
    - Node 0: degree 5
    - Node 1: degree 4
    - Node 2: degree 4
    - Node 3: degree 4
    - Node 4: degree 3
    - Node 5: degree 2
    - Node 6: degree 2
    - Node 7: degree 3
    - Node 8: degree 1
    - Node 9: degree 3
    - Node 10: degree 3
    - Node 11: degree 2
    - Node 12: degree 4
    - Node 13: degree 2
    - Node 14: degree 3
    - Node 15: degree 4
    - Node 16: degree 2
    - Node 17: degree 2
    - Node 18: degree 4
    - Node 19: degree 3

2. Identify the 3-stars based on the degrees of the nodes:
   - The nodes with degree 3 or 4 can be potential central nodes of 3-stars.
   - For each potential central node, check how many nodes are connected to it by an edge.
   - If there are exactly three nodes connected to a potential central node, that forms a 3-star.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - Based on the above analysis, we have the following 3-stars:

   <0, (5, 1, 16)>
   <1, (3, 0, 17)>
   <2, (15, 12, 18)>
   <3, (15, 17, 13)>
   <4, (2, 19, 11)>
   <7, (15, 18, 10)>
   <9, (6, 0, 12)>
   <10, (1, 5, 7)>
   <12, (3, 14, 9)>
   <14, (6, 8, 12)>
   <15, (3, 7, 2)>
   <18, (2, 19, 0)>
   <19, (18, 11, 4)>

   Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
