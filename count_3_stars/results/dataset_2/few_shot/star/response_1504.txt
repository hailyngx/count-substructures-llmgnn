Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with three connections are: 11, 3, 10, 1, 4, 7, and 15.
- We will consider each of these nodes as potential centers for the 3-star graphs.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<10, (0, 15, 5)>
<1, (7, 17, 15)>
<10, (0, 5, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<3, (11, 8, 5)>
<13, (16, 19, 7)>
<7, (13, 17, 1)>
<15, (7, 12, 0)>
<16, (11, 13, 18)>
<11, (16, 3, 17)>
<4, (10, 19, 5)>
<12, (8, 14, 15)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars gives us: [12].
