Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17)

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We see that in a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Now, let's go through each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-star configurations:

- From node 0: <0, (2, 12, 17)>
- From node 1: <1, (11, 16, 18)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 18, 0)>
- From node 3: <3, (15, 7, 10)>
- From node 5: <5, (16, 9, 13)>
- From node 6: <6, (11, 9, 17)>
- From node 7: <7, (11, 8, 12)>
- From node 9: <9, (6, 5, 18)>
- From node 11: <11, (16, 7, 1)>
- From node 12: <12, (7, 0, 19)>
- From node 15: <15, (3, 17, 0)>
- From node 16: <16, (11, 1, 5)>
- From node 17: <17, (15, 6, 0)>
- From node 18: <18, (9, 2, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [13].
