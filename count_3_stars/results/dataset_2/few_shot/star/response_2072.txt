Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's begin by identifying the 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<14, (17, 25, 3)>
<17, (14, 20, 28)>
<6, (9, 7, 25)>
<9, (6, 2, 16)>
<22, (11, 0, 29)>
<23, (19, 15, 29)>
<4, (8, 13, 21)>
<8, (4, 10, 0)>
<1, (26, 15, 29)>
<26, (1, 18, 7)>
<2, (9, 12, -)>
<21, (4, 28, 19)>
<28, (17, 21, 5)>
<5, (28, 13, 7)>
<13, (4, 5, -)>
<20, (17, 3, -)>
<15, (23, 1, 10)>
<10, (8, 15, 27)>
<19, (23, 21, -)>
<18, (17, 26, -)>
<7, (6, 26, 5)>
<16, (9, 4, 7)>
<12, (2, 29, -)>
<11, (22, 15, 24)>
<24, (11, 3, 0)>
<29, (22, 23, 1)>
<25, (14, 9, 24)>
<3, (14, 20, 24)>
<0, (22, 8, 24)>
<27, (10, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [30].
