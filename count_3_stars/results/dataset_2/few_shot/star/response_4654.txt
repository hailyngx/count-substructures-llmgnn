Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 2
- Node 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at these nodes:

For Node 2, there is no 3-star since it only has one neighbor.

For Node 4, the 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 11, 13)>
<4, (11, 13, 14)>
<4, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
