Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 3, 11)>
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<2, (8, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 10, 6)>
<4, (5, 10, 11)>
<5, (9, 1, 14)>
<6, (10, 7, 3)>
<7, (2, 0, 6)>
<8, (11, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 1, 12)>
<10, (3, 6, 4)>
<11, (5, 1, 4)>
<12, (9, 8, 14)>
<13, (3, 14)>
<14, (5, 4, 12)>

Count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
