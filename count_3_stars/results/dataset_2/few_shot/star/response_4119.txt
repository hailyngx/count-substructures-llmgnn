Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's look at each node and its connections to see if it forms any 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 other nodes.
2. Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (5, 9, 6)> as it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6.
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (5, 9, 7)> as it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 other nodes.
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (9, 7, 6)> as it is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 6.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 other nodes.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 other nodes.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 other nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 other nodes.
10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (5, 4, 6)> and <9, (5, 2, 7)> as it is connected to nodes 5, 4, 6 and nodes 5, 2, 7.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5] when represented inside brackets. 
The 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>.
