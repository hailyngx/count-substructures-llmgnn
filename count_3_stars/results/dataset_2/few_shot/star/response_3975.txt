Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. From the adjacency list:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 2: <1, (6, 7, 2)>
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1: <2, (9, 7, 1)>
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 5: <3, (6, 0, 5)>
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 3: <5, (6, 4, 3)>
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 3: <6, (5, 1, 3)>
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 2: <7, (9, 0, 2)>
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3: <8, (6, 1, 3)>
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7: <9, (2, 7)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.
