The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 11, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 13, 14, 9, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 14, 10, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 0, 10, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 12, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 6, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 12, 14, 2, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 14, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 13, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 2, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 11, 9, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 5: <0, (4, 3, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, and 14: <2, (3, 13, 14)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, and 10: <3, (1, 0, 10)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 0, and 1: <4, (12, 0, 1)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 14, and 2: <9, (12, 14, 2)>
6. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 3: <10, (4, 1, 3)>
7. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 14, and 0: <11, (13, 14, 0)>

Hence, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
