Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every group of four nodes where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node. Let's go step-by-step to find and count the 3-stars:

1. For each node, check its neighbors and see if there are any 3-star configurations around it.

- For Node 0: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 1: One 3-star configuration: <1, (3, 10, 11)>
- For Node 2: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 3: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 4: One 3-star configuration: <4, (5, 7, 14)>
- For Node 5: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 6: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 7: Two 3-star configurations: <7, (4, 8, 11)> and <7, (6, 8, 13)>
- For Node 8: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 9: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 10: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 11: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 12: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 13: No 3-stars configurations around it.
- For Node 14: No 3-stars configurations around it.

Therefore, the final answer is [4] 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 10, 11)>, <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 11)>, <7, (6, 8, 13)>
