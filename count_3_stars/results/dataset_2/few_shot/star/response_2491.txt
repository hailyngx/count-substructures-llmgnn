Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 10, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 13, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 10, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 11, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, 2, 0, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 14, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 11

Response:
Starting with node 0, it forms 1 three-star: <0, (6, 10, 11)>  
Moving on to node 1, it forms 0 three-star  
Node 2 forms 0 three-star  
Node 3 forms 0 three-star  
Node 4 forms 1 three-star: <4, (5, 7, 11)>  
Node 5 forms 2 three-stars: <5, (4, 6, 9)>, and <5, (2, 4, 9)>  
Node 6 forms 1 three-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>  
Node 7 forms 0 three-star  
Node 8 forms 1 three-star: <8, (9, 12, 13)>  
Node 9 forms 3 three-stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (10, 13, 7)>, and <9, (11, 4, 10)>  
Node 10 forms 1 three-star: <10, (9, 12, 13)>  
Node 11 forms 1 three-star: <11, (4, 0, 14)>  
Node 12 forms 0 three-star  
Node 13 forms 0 three-star  
Node 14 forms 0 three-star  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (6, 10, 11)>  
<4, (5, 7, 11)>  
<5, (4, 6, 9)>  
<5, (2, 4, 9)>  
<6, (0, 5, 9)>  
<8, (9, 12, 13)>  
<9, (5, 6, 8)>  
<9, (10, 13, 7)>  
<9, (11, 4, 10)>  
<10, (9, 12, 13)>
