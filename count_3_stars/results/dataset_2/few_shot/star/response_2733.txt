Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0 is connected to 10, 16, 3, and 13. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 17, 12, 15, and 18. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to 13 and 3. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to 5, 8, 2, and 0. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to 7, 8, 19, and 14. This forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 19)>.
- Node 5 is connected to 9, 1, and 3. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to 17, 11, 15, and 19. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 and 12. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to 4, 3, and 18. This forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 3, 18)>.
- Node 9 is connected to 5, 18, and 12. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 10 is connected to 0. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 11 is connected to 6. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 12 is connected to 9, 7, 16, and 1. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 13 is connected to 2, 15, 0, 16, and 18. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14 is connected to 4. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 15 is connected to 1, 6, and 13. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 16 is connected to 12, 0, and 13. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 17 is connected to 1 and 6. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 18 is connected to 9, 8, 1, and 13. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 19 is connected to 4 and 6. This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
These 3-stars are: <4, (7, 8, 19)>, and <8, (4, 3, 18)>.
