Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that particular node as the center.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 14, and 23. <0, (25, 14, 23)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 26, and 13. <1, (29, 26, 13)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and (no third node).
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 19, and 24. <3, (9, 19, 24)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 6, and (no third node).
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 8, and (no third node).
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 22, and 2. <6, (26, 22, 2)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 24, and 27. <7, (29, 24, 27)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 22, and 3. <9, (10, 22, 3)>
10. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 16, and (no third node).
11. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 21, and 2. <11, (14, 21, 2)>
12. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 16, and (no third node).
13. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 19, and 27. <13, (1, 19, 27)>
14. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 8, and 12. <14, (20, 8, 12)>
15. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 26, and (no third node).
16. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 12, and (no third node).
17. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 15, and (no third node).
18. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 27, and (no third node).
19. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 29, and 3. <19, (28, 29, 3)>
20. Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 14, and 24. <20, (25, 14, 24)>
21. Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 11, and 8. <21, (29, 11, 8)>
22. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 9, and 6. <22, (28, 9, 6)>
23. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and (no third node).
24. Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 3, and 7. <24, (20, 3, 7)>
25. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 18, and (no third node).
26. Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 21, and 15. <26, (1, 21, 15)>
27. Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 28, and 13. <27, (17, 28, 13)>
28. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 19, and 22. <28, (27, 19, 22)>
29. Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 21, and 7. <29, (1, 21, 7)>

Since we have identified all the 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
