Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (6, 7, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 4)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 7, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get: [45]
