Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the number of 3-stars for each central node and then summing them up. 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:
1. Node 0: <0, (13, 2, 16)>
2. Node 1: <1, (6, 15, 19)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 12, 16)>
4. Node 3: <3, (9, x, x)> (Only one possible 3-star with 3 as the central node)
5. Node 4: <4, (9, 8, 13)> and <4, (9, 5, 17)>
6. Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 17)> and <5, (8, 4, 13)>
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 7)>
8. Node 7: <7, (6, 15, 19)>
9. Node 8: <8, (5, 4, 13)> and <8, (5, 12, 15)>
10. Node 9: <9, (4, 11, 18)>
11. Node 10: <10, (13, x, x)> (Only one possible 3-star with 10 as the central node)
12. Node 11: <11, (9, 18, x)>
13. Node 12: <12, (19, 2, 18)>
14. Node 13: <13, (4, 6, 0)>
15. Node 14: <14, (19, 16, x)>
16. Node 15: <15, (6, 1, 7)>
17. Node 16: <16, (14, 2, 18)>
18. Node 17: <17, (5, 8, x)>
19. Node 18: <18, (11, 16, x)>
20. Node 19: <19, (1, 7, 12)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(3) + (1) + (6) + (1) + (2) + (1) + (1) + (2) + (1) + (1)] = [19].
