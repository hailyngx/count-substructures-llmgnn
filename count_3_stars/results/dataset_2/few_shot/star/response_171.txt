Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
