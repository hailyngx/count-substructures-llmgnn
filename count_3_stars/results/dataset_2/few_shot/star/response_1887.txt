Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the given graph based on this information:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2.

So, there are 3 instances of 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
