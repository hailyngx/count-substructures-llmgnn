Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 13, 3)>
<1, (6, 11, 4)>
<2, (7, 13, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 13)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<6, (8, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 10, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 8, 12)>
<11, (4, 1, 2)>
<12, (9, 8, 10)>
<13, (5, 2, 14)>
<14, (4, 13, 2)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.]
