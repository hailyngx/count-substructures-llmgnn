Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the 3-star structures will be formed by the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (11, 15, 12)>
<1, (18, 4, 14)>
<2, (5, 17, 9)>
<3, (16, 6, 4)>
<4, (6, 15, 9)>
<5, (6, 19, 2)>
<6, (5, 16, 4)>
<7, (13, 19, 17)>
<8, (13, 15, 12)>
<9, (16, 4, 2)>
<10, (18)>
<11, (16, 0, 12)>
<12, (8, 5, 0)>
<13, (16, 8, 17)>
<14, (5, 9)>
<15, (8, 0, 4)>
<16, (11, 13, 3)>
<17, (13, 2, 7)>
<18, (10, 1)>
<19, (5, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The count is [20].
