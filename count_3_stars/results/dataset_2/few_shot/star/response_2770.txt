Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all such instances:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 1, 13, and 8 (This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the central node)
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 4 (This forms a 3-star with node 15 as the central node)
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 13, and 9 (This forms a 3-star with node 14 as the central node)
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 16, and 16 (This forms a 3-star with node 17 as the central node)
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 7 (This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the central node)
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 0 (This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the central node)
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 18 (This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the central node)
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 5 (This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the central node)
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 12 (This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the central node)
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 9 (This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the central node)
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 19, and 12 (This forms a 3-star with node 11 as the central node)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [11]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (15, 1, 8)>
<15, (3, 10, 4)>
<14, (17, 13, 9)>
<17, (14, 16, 16)>
<1, (3, 7, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 0)>
<5, (14, 11, 18)>
<6, (10, 5, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 12)>
<0, (11, 8, 9)>
<11, (10, 19, 12)>
