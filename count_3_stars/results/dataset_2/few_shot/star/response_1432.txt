Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph. If it is, then we have found a 3-star centered at that node.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 5, 1)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 2, 1)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (4, 3, 1)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
