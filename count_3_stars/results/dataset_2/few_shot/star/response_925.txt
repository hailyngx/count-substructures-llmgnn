Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4: (1, 12, 11) [<4, (1, 12, 11)>]
2. Node 7: (4, 10, 11) [<7, (4, 10, 11)>]
3. Node 10: (4, 7, 11) [<10, (4, 7, 11)>]
4. Node 11: (4, 7, 10) [<11, (4, 7, 10)>]
5. Node 12: (4, 10, 11) [<12, (4, 10, 11)>]
6. Node 1: (4, 5, 13) [<1, (4, 5, 13)>]
7. Node 3: (1, 5, 13) [Node 3 does not form a 3-star]
8. Node 8: (1, 13, 5) [<8, (1, 13, 5)>]
9. Node 13: (1, 8, 5) [Node 13 does not form a 3-star]
10. Node 10: (7, 11, 6) [Node 10 does not form a 3-star]
11. Node 12: (7, 11, 14) [Node 12 does not form a 3-star]
12. Node 5: (7, 1, 13) [Node 5 does not form a 3-star]
13. Node 8: (13, 1, 5) [Node 8 does not form a 3-star]
14. Node 7: (14, 4, 11) [Node 7 does not form a 3-star]
15. Node 12: (14, 4, 11) [Node 12 does not form a 3-star]

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
