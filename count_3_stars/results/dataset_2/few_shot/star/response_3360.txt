Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying those 3-stars:

<9, (26, 18, 14)>
<26, (9, 1, 29)>
<3, (15, 0, 6)>
<0, (3, 27, 24)>
<27, (0, 12, 7)>
<20, (25, 29, 11)>
<1, (26, 28, 23)>
<10, (25, 8, 19)>
<22, (19, 28, 5)>
<5, (15, 19, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found, which is 10. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
