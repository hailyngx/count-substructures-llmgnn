Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by first identifying the central node and then finding the leaves connected to it. Let's proceed with this approach.

Identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (9, 7, 2)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 4)>
    - <2, (8, 14, 0)>
    - <3, (1, 11, 5)>
    - <4, (6, 1, 3)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 12)>
    - <6, (10, 11, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 12, 0)>
    - <8, (6, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (10, 13, 0)>
    - <10, (6, 9, 5)>
    - <11, (6, 3, 5)>
    - <12, (9, 4, 7)>
    - <13, (9, 11, 14)>
    - <14, (2, 11, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
