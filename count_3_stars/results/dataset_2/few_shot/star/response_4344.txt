Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes. Let's break down the steps:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star structure with their adjacent nodes.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes:
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 14
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 17, 19, 4

Now, let's check if they form 3-stars:
- For Node 14: <14, (2, 3, 14)>
- For Node 4: <4, (17, 19, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
