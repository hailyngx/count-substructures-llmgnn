Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 1, and 0 <5, (9, 1, 0)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, and 1 <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 9, and 7 <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 9, and 3 <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 1, and 4 <2, (6, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
