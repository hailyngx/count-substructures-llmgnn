Response:
The center nodes in the 3-stars can be identified by looking at the nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes. Let's list the center nodes:

1. Node 1
2. Node 18
3. Node 21

Next, we can identify the 3-stars with these center nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes:

1. <5, (0, 10, 7)>
2. <7, (11, 17, 5)>
3. <14, (29, 3, 23)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
