Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (27, 1, 19)>
<1, (0, 11, 19)>
<2, (4, 18, 25)>
<3, (22, 13, 21)>
<4, (7, 2, 23)>
<5, (13, 17, 16)>
<6, (7, 18, 13)>
<7, (4, 25, 6)>
<8, (25, 19, 20)>
<9, (3, 12)>
<10, (22, 29, 15)>
<11, (28, 14, 1)>
<12, (25, 11, 9)>
<13, (5, 3, 6)>
<14, (29, 11, 6)>
<15, (10, 23, 21)>
<16, (28, 5, 19)>
<18, (22, 2, 6)>
<19, (0, 16, 8)>
<20, (25, 21)>
<21, (20, 15, 3)>
<22, (18, 26, 10)>
<23, (4, 15, 24)>
<24, (18, 23)>
<25, (7, 20, 8)>
<26, (22)>
<27, (0)>
<28, (29, 16, 11)>
<29, (28, 14, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
