Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what a 3-star is. 

In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list provided, we can identify all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
