Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 15, 5, and 18.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 12.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 0 and 12.
- Node 13: Connected to node 9.
- Node 18: Connected to node 6.

2. Form 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- For node 6: <6, (15, 5, 18)>
- For node 7: <7, (5, 12, unknown)>
- For node 10: <10, (0, 12, unknown)>
- For node 13: <13, (9, unknown, unknown)>
- For node 18: <18, (6, unknown, unknown)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
