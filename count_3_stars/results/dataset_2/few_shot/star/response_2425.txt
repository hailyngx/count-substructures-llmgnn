Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition, a 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it. Let's list down the potential 3-stars:

1. <13, (9, 8, 15)>
2. <13, (9, 11, 15)>
3. <13, (9, 15, 29)>
4. <13, (8, 11, 15)>
5. <13, (8, 15, 29)>
6. <6, (9, 21, 11)>
7. <6, (21, 22, 5)>
8. <9, (6, 4, 13)>
9. <9, (4, 19, 11)>
10. <9, (4, 10, 23)>
11. <4, (9, 19, 19)>
12. <4, (19, 11, 10)>
13. <4, (19, 10, 24)>
14. <15, (25, 13, 23)>
15. <15, (13, 5, 9)>
16. <15, (5, 21, 22)>
17. <25, (15, 7, 8)>
18. <25, (7, 20, 1)>
19. <25, (7, 17, 14)>
20. <8, (25, 13, 27)>
21. <8, (13, 9, 6)>
22. <8, (13, 29, 18)>
23. <7, (17, 25, 3)>
24. <7, (25, 20, 1)>
25. <7, (25, 18, 26)>
26. <0, (14, 28, 29)>
27. <17, (14, 27, 7)>
28. <17, (27, 8, 22)>
29. <27, (17, 8, 12)>
30. <27, (8, 22, 21)>

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars [30]
