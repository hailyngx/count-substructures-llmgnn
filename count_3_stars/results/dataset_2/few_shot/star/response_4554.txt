Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<[0, (3, 6, 7)]>
<[0, (3, 7, 8)]>
<[0, (3, 0, 13)]>
<[0, (6, 7, 0)]>
<[0, (6, 7, 1)]>
<[0, (6, 7, 17)]>
<[0, (6, 0, 13)]>
<[0, (7, 0, 8)]>
<[0, (7, 1, 8)]>
<[0, (7, 17, 5)]>
<[0, (8, 0, 19)]>
<[0, (8, 1, 7)]>
<[3, (15, 3, 0)]>
<[3, (15, 4, 10)]>
<[4, (15, 3, 0)]>
<[4, (15, 3, 0)]>
<[5, (17, 2, 18)]>
<[5, (17, 2, 18)]>
<[6, (9, 6, 0)]>
<[9, (16, 9, 12)]>
<[10, (12, 10, 18)]>
<[12, (19, 12, 16)]>
<[13, (10, 13, 0)]>
<[17, (7, 17, 5)]>
<[18, (2, 18, 16)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
