Response:
Based on the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars within this graph.

Let's first find the nodes that are part of a 3-star:

1. Node 1 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 6, 12, and 29. 
2. Node 3 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 16, 21, and 9.
3. Node 4 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 16, 15, and 28.
4. Node 5 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 22, 26, and 14.
5. Node 6 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 23, 28, and 1.
6. Node 8 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 2, 19, and 14.
7. Node 9 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 24, and 14.
8. Node 10 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 15, 27, and 22.
9. Node 11 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 16, 19, and 25.
10. Node 12 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 6, 26, and 1.
11. Node 14 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 28, 8, and 9.
12. Node 16 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 3, and 4.
13. Node 17 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 22, 3, and 18.
14. Node 18 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 26, 17, and 29.
15. Node 19 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 8, and 10.
16. Node 20 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 15, 7, and no other node.
17. Node 22 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 5, 28, and 10.
18. Node 25 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 29, and no other node.
19. Node 26 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 10, 5, and 18.
20. Node 27 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 16, no other node, no other node.

Hence, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
