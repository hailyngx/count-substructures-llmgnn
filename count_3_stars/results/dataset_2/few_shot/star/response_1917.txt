Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) to form 3-stars. 

Analyzing the graph and the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
