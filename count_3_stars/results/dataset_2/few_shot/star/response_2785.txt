Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:
1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars. From the adjacency list, we find the following nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes: 17, 5, 0
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes: 11, 10
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 7, 2, 19
- Node 14 is connected to 2 nodes: 17, 5
- Node 15 is connected to 3 nodes: 16, 10, 2
- Node 18 is connected to 1 node: 5

2. We will now check each potential center to see if they form a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, and those 3 other nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Checking the potential 3-stars:
- <6, (17, 5, 0)> (Since 17 and 5 are directly connected)
- <8, (11, 10, _)> (Valid 3-star)
- <9, (7, 2, 19)> (Valid 3-star)
- <14, (17, 5, _)> (Valid 3-star)
- <15, (16, 10, 2)> (Valid 3-star)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<8, (11, 10, _)>
<9, (7, 2, 19)>
<14, (17, 5, _)>
<15, (16, 10, 2)>
