Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars by locating the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
1. <0, (7, 9, 22)>
2. <1, (4, 15, -)>
3. <2, (16, 3, 28)>
4. <3, (7, 17, 21)>
5. <4, (7, 22, -)>
6. <5, (10, 19, 14)>
7. <6, (25, 27, -)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 10)>
9. <8, (28, 15, -)>
10. <9, (21, 24, 0)>
11. <10, (7, 21, 5)>
12. <11, (17, 29, 5)>
13. <12, (20, 16, -)>
14. <13, (15, 3, 24)>
15. <14, (20, 25, 5)>
16. <15, (8, 1, 13)>
17. <16, (2, 12, 23)>
18. <17, (29, 3, 11)>
19. <18, (29, 19, 24)>
20. <19, (25, 5, 18)>
21. <20, (25, 12, 14)>
22. <21, (25, 10, 9)>
23. <22, (4, 20, 28)>
24. <24, (9, 18, 21)>
25. <25, (20, 6, 19)>
26. <27, (6, -,-)>
27. <28, (22, 2, 8)>
28. <29, (17, 11, 18)>

There are a total of 28 unique 3-stars present in the given graph.
Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
