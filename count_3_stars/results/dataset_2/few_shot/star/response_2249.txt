Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Total number of nodes: 10  
Total number of edges: 40

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 5, 9, 6: <0, (5, 9, 6)>

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 5, 6, 8: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
   - Node 1, 2, 7: <1, (1, 2, 7)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 9, 8, 1: <2, (9, 8, 1)>
   - Node 2, 3, 7: <2, (2, 3, 7)>

4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-stars.

5. For Node 4:
   - No 3-stars.

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 1, 4, 0: <5, (1, 4, 0)>
   - Node 8, 6, 0: <5, (8, 6, 0)>

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 1, 7, 3: <6, (1, 7, 3)>
   - Node 9, 8, 0: <6, (9, 8, 0)>

8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-stars.

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 6, 2, 1: <8, (6, 2, 1)>

10. For Node 9:
   - No 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
