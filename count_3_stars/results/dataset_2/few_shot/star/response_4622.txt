Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form a 3-star configuration with the center (the node with degree 3).

1. Identify the center node with degree 3:
   - Node 14 is the center node as it is connected to exactly three other nodes (17, 26, 19).

2. For each neighbor of the center node (14), check if they form a 3-star configuration:
   - (14, 17, 1, 6)
   - (14, 26, 27, 15)
   - (14, 19, 1, 2)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have: 
<14, (17, 1, 6)>, <14, (26, 27, 15)>, <14, (19, 1, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
