Response:
We are looking for 3-star structures in the graph. To form a 3-star, we need one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 16, and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 12.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 18.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 2.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 18, and 13.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 0.

2. From the identified nodes, we can form the following 3-stars:
   - <1, (3, 2, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 11, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 16, 5)>
   - <4, (3, 15, 12)>
   - <5, (3, 6, 18)>
   - <9, (14, 11, 2)>
   - <10, (15, 18, 13)>
   - <12, (14, 4, 0)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
