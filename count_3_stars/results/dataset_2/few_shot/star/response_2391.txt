Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars identified in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 19)>
<3, (1, 19, 18)>
<4, (1, 2, 19)>
<5, (18, 4, 10)>
<6, (7, 10, 12)>
<7, (6, 11, 15)>
<8, (1, 0, 15)>
<9, (17, 18, 9)>
<10, (6, 19, 5)>
<11, (2, 7, 19)>
<12, (6, 16, 8)>
<13, (0)>
<14, (17)>
<15, (17, 7, 8)>
<16, (2, 12)>
<17, (14, 9, 15)>
<18, (3, 7, 9)>
<19, (1, 3, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
