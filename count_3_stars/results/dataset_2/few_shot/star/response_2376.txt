Response:
The graph consists of 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars. 

There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (12, 17, 22)>
<5, (1, 7, 29)>
<7, (13, 28, 29)>
<11, (1, 8, 17)>
<13, (5, 7, 29)>
<15, (19, 23, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
