Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 10 is connected to node 12, 3, 1, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 13, 3, 14, 1, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, 14, 6, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 12, 11, and node 2

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <3, (12, 11, 10)>
- <4, (5, 3, 1)>
- <5, (9, 13, 2)>
- <10, (12, 3, 1)>
- <12, (9, 10, 6)>
- <13, (9, 11, 6)>
- <14, (7, 12, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
