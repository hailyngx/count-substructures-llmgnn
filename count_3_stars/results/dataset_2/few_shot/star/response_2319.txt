Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 14, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 11, 10, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 2, 1, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 0, 3, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 3, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 7, 13, 3, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 5, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 12, 11, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (7, 1, 11)>
<4, (8, 10, 4)>
<5, (13, 11, 5)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (12, 3, 11)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (9, 0, 12)>
<10, (3, 10, 2)>
<11, (13, 5, 11)>
<12, (9, 7, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
