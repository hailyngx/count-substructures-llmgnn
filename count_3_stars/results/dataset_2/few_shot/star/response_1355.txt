Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<0, (6, 4, 3)>
<0, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (4, 2, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<0, (2, 1, 9)>
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 0)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 8, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 0)>
<7, (9, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [21]
