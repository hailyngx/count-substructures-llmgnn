Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if there are three edges connected to it. If there are three edges, then we have a 3-star centered at that node.

Analyzing the provided information:

Nodes with 3 edges: 6, 18  
Nodes with 2 edges: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19  
Nodes with 1 edge: 4, 8, 12, 13, 16  

So, there are 2 potential center nodes for 3-stars: 6 and 18.

For node 6, the 3-stars would be:  
<6, (9, 15, 2)>  
<6, (9, 15, 12)>  
So, there are 2 3-stars centered at node 6.

For node 18, the 3-stars would be:  
<18, (4, 10, 15)>  
<18, (4, 10, 13)>  
<18, (15, 9, 6)>  
So, there are 3 3-stars centered at node 18.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (9, 15, 2)>, <6, (9, 15, 12)>, <18, (4, 10, 15)>, <18, (4, 10, 13)>, <18, (15, 9, 6)>.
