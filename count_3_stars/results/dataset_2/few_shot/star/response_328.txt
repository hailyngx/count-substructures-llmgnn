Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, 11, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 13, 11, 1, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 10, and node 14

Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 14, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 3, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the <central node, (leaves)> combinations where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (6, 13, 0)>
<5, (8, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<13, (4, 2, 3)>
<14, (4, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
