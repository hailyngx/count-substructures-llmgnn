Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 11, 5)>
<3, (1, 10, 2)>
<4, (18, 10, 27)>
<5, (1, 19, 24)>
<6, (24, 20, 7)>
<7, (16, 29, 20)>
<8, (3, 14, 21)>
<9, (1, 2, 12)>
<10, (3, 4, 27)>
<11, (1, 22, 24)>
<13, (14, 17, 24)>
<14, (8, 27, 13)>
<15, (0, 12, 15)>
<16, (28, 26, 7)>
<17, (21, 13, 2)>
<18, (4, 27, 10)>
<19, (5, 23, 19)>
<20, (6, 16, 7)>
<21, (28, 8, 29)>
<22, (11, 0, 25)>
<23, (26, 19, 23)>
<24, (5, 6, 13)>
<25, (22, 29, 10)>
<26, (23, 29, 16)>
<27, (18, 14, 10)>
<28, (21, 16, 2)>
<29, (21, 26, 7)>

There are 27 unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
