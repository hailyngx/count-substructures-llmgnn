Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (1, 0, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 13, 2)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<10, (1, 13, 0)>
<13, (5, 11, 10)>
<14, (7, 3, 5)>
<14, (7, 3, 6)>
<14, (7, 5, 10)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [12] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
