Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The central node of a 3-star graph has degree 3 and is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 8, 13, and 28 are the central nodes as they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes each.

For a 3-star graph with a central node X, the possible combinations of 3 connected nodes are:
1. (1, 2, 3)
2. (1, 2, 4)
3. (1, 2, 5)
4. (1, 2, 6)
5. (2, 3, 4)
6. (2, 3, 7)
7. (2, 3, 8)

Now, let's count the number of occurrences for each unique 3-star:

<8, (25, 28, 24)>
<8, (25, 28, 21)>
<8, (25, 28, 22)>
<13, (28, 14, 16)>
<13, (28, 14, 27)>
<13, (28, 14, 9)>
<28, (8, 13, 22)>
<28, (8, 13, 0)>
<28, (8, 13, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
