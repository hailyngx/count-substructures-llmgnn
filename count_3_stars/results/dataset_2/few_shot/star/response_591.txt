Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 neighbors and check if they form a 3-star.  
From the adjacency list, nodes 0, 2, and 6 have exactly 3 neighbors.  
Examining their neighbors, we find three 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (6, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>

Step 2: Count the number of identified 3-stars.  
Total 3-stars = 3  

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
