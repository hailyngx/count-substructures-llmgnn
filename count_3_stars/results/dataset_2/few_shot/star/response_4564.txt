Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes that fit the criteria of being the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 28, 22, and 29)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 19 and 23)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 22 and 14)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 15, 7, and 27)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 15, 8, and 16)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 11, and 24)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (28, 22, 29)>
<1, (19, 23)>
<2, (22, 14)>
<3, (15, 7, 27)>
<4, (15, 8, 16)>
<5, (9, 11, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
