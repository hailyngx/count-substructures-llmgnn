Response:
Start by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can potentially form the center of a 3-star.  
After examining the provided adjacency list, nodes 1, 8, and 11 each have exactly three neighbors. Let's consider each of these nodes as a potential center of a 3-star and find the corresponding leaves connected to them:

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 12 and node 16.
- As node 1 has only two neighbors, it cannot form the center of a 3-star.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 10 and node 18.
- Node 18 is connected to node 17, 19, and 16. (So, a 3-star centered at Node 8 with leaves 10, 18, 17 is found.)

For Node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to node 7 and node 2.
- As node 11 has only two neighbors, it cannot form the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is: 
<8, (10, 18, 17)>
