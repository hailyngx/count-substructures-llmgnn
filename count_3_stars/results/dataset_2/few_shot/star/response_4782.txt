Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through each node's adjacency list and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: 
    - <0, (5, 19)>
2. Node 1: 
    - <1, (6, 19, 9)>
3. Node 2: 
    - No 3-stars.
4. Node 3: 
    - No 3-stars.
5. Node 4: 
    - No 3-stars.
6. Node 5: 
    - <5, (16, 13, 6)>
    - <5, (16, 12, 0)>
7. Node 6: 
    - No 3-stars.
8. Node 7: 
    - <7, (16, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: 
    - No 3-stars.
10. Node 9: 
    - <9, (14, 18, 1)>
    - <9, (14, 7, 12)>
11. Node 10: 
    - No 3-stars.
12. Node 11: 
    - No 3-stars.
13. Node 12: 
    - No 3-stars.
14. Node 13: 
    - No 3-stars.
15. Node 14: 
    - No 3-stars.
16. Node 15: 
    - No 3-stars.
17. Node 16: 
    - No 3-stars.
18. Node 17: 
    - No 3-stars.
19. Node 18: 
    - No 3-stars.
20. Node 19: 
    - <19, (14, 1, 0)>
    
Count of 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
