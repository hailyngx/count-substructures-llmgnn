Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 forms 1 three-star: <0, (8, 3, _)> where _ could be either 2 or 6, but since the three-stars have to be unique, we can only consider one of these.

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 forms 1 three-star: <1, (5, 6, 7)>

Moving to Node 2:
- Node 2 forms 1 three-star: <2, (6, 8, 3)>

Moving to Node 3:
- Node 3 forms 1 three-star: <3, (5, 9, 6)>

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 forms 1 three-star: <4, (7, 8, 3)>

Moving to Node 5:
- Node 5 forms no three-stars.

Moving to Node 6:
- Node 6 forms 2 three-stars: <6, (9, 1, 7)> and <6, (1, 7, 3)>

Moving to Node 7:
- Node 7 forms no three-stars.

Moving to Node 8:
- Node 8 forms 1 three-star: <8, (6, 4, 2)>

Moving to Node 9:
- Node 9 forms no three-stars.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (8, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>, and <8, (6, 4, 2)>.
