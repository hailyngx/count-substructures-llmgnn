Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 10
- Node 19
- Node 24

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 21)>
<10, (3, 15, 27)>
<19, (18, 21, 4)>
<24, (5, 13, 26)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
