Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with the most number of connections are nodes 1, 4, and 8, each connected to 6 other nodes.

1. For node 1:
   - <1, (5, 9, 4)>
   - <1, (5, 9, 3)>
   - <1, (5, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (5, 4, 8)>
   - <1, (5, 3, 6)>
   - <1, (9, 4, 6)>
   - Total 3-stars: 6

2. For node 4:
   - <4, (7, 8, 0)>
   - <4, (7, 8, 1)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 3)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (8, 1, 6)>
   - <4, (8, 1, 0)>
   - Total 3-stars: 6

3. For node 8:
   - <8, (9, 4, 0)>
   - <8, (9, 4, 6)>
   - <8, (9, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (9, 1, 0)>
   - <8, (4, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (4, 1, 0)>
   - Total 3-stars: 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
