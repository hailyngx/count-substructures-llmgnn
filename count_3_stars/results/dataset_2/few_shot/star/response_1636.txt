Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, 7, 4, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, 7)>  
2. <1, (6, 9, 0)>  
3. <2, (9, 4, 0)>  
4. <3, (8, 7, 4)>  
5. <4, (9, 2, 0)>  
6. <5, (8, 0, 7)>
