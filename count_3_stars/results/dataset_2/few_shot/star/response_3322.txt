Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. We can identify 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (7, 15, 16)>
<5, (11, 14, 18)>
<6, (18, 26, 28)>
<9, (23, 27, 28)>
<10, (0, 25, 27)>
<12, (22, 25, 13)>
<17, (19, 24, 27)>
<20, (15, 21, 61)>
<21, (16, 20, 61)>
<26, (3, 6, 14)>
<27, (10, 17, 23)>
