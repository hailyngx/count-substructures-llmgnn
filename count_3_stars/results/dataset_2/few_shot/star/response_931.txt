Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
3. <4, (9, 7, 0)>
4. <7, (4, 6, 2)>
5. <6, (5, 9, 4)>
6. <2, (5, 7, 1)>
7. <8, (5, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
