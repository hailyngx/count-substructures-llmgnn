Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 8, 2)>
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
