Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first need to identify any 3-star structures in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- 3-star with central node 1: (1, 3, 8, 11)
- 3-star with central node 8: (8, 1, 5, 14)
- 3-star with central node 11: (11, 1, 4, 14)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-star structures inside brackets []:

[3] 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 11)>
<8, (1, 5, 14)>
<11, (1, 4, 14)>
