Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph and then count them:
<0, (14, 10, 3)>
<1, (16, 6, 15)>
<2, (11, 17, -)>
<3, (8, 0, 13)>
<4, (18, 13, -)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<7, (5, -, 10)>
<8, (11, 16, -)>
<9, (11, -, 17)>
<10, (6, 0, 14)>
<11, (9, 8, -)>
<12, (17, 10, 3)>
<13, (16, 4, 17)>
<14, (5, 0, 10)>
<15, (18, -, 1)>
<16, (1, 13, 8)>
<17, (4, 9, 13)>
<18, (4, -, 15)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
