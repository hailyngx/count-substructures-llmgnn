Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the central nodes: We need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

2. Count the 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 1: (1, 9, 3), (1, 4, 5)
- For node 2: (2, 6, 0), (2, 9, 3), (2, 8, 7)
- For node 3: (3, 1, 9), (3, 2, 5)
- For node 4: (4, 6, 9), (4, 1, 5)
- For node 7: (7, 1, 8), (7, 0, 5)
- For node 8: (8, 6, 2), (8, 1, 7), (8, 3, 5)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (9, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>, <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <2, (8, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 5, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>, <4, (1, 5, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
