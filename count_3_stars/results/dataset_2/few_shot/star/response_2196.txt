Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through each node and its connections:
- Node 0: 3-stars: <0, (17, 5, X)>, where X is any node except 0, 17, or 5
- Node 1: 3-stars: <1, (21, 12, X)>, where X is any node except 1, 21, or 12
- Node 2: 3-stars: <2, (15, 20, 9)>; <2, (15, 20, 8)>
- Node 3: 3-stars: <3, (26, 7, X)>, where X is any node except 3, 26, or 7
- Node 4: 3-stars: <4, (10, 19, 12)>
- Node 5: 3-stars: <5, (0, X, X)>, where X is any node except 0 or 5
- Node 6: 3-stars: <6, (25, 9, 14)>
- Node 7: 3-stars: <7, (21, 16, 26)>
- Node 8: 3-stars: <8, (2, 24, 22)>
- Node 9: 3-stars: <9, (21, 2, 24)>
- Node 10: 3-stars: <10, (15, 27, 4)>
- Node 11: 3-stars: <11, (28, 14, X)>, where X is any node except 11, 28, or 14
- Node 12: 3-stars: <12, (1, 4, 23)>
