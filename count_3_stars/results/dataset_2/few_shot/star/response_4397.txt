Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 5, and 6.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 18.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 10, and 13.

2. Find 3-stars centered around the identified nodes:
   - <4, (7, 10, 5)>
   - <4, (7, 10, 6)>
   - <4, (7, 10, 3)>
   - <10, (4, 6, 18)>
   - <18, (11, 12, 10)>
   - <18, (12, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
