Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can first list out the possible 3-stars using the given edges:

<9, (26, 6, 8)>
<3, (27, 23, 5)>
<15, (8, 25, 13)>
<6, (9, 28, 11)>
<10, (17, 18, 2)>
<0, (14, 24, 8)>
<17, (10, 28, 22)>
<14, (0, 19, 24)>
<20, (26, 19, 21)>

Next, let's check how many instances of each unique 3-star we have in the graph:

<9, (26, 6, 8)> appears twice.
<3, (27, 23, 5)> and <6, (9, 28, 11)> each appear once.
<15, (8, 25, 13)>, <10, (17, 18, 2)>, <0, (14, 24, 8)>, <17, (10, 28, 22)>, <14, (0, 19, 24)>, and <20, (26, 19, 21)> each appear zero times.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
