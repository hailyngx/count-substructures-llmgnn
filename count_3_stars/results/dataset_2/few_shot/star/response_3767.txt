Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center node.

From the adjacency list provided, we can determine the following 3-stars:
1. Center node: 0, Leaf nodes: (9, 1, 3) <0, (9, 1, 3)>
2. Center node: 1, Leaf nodes: (6, 2, 8) <1, (6, 2, 8)>
3. Center node: 2, Leaf nodes: (9, 1, 4) <2, (9, 1, 4)>
4. Center node: 3, Leaf nodes: (1, 0, 4) <3, (1, 0, 4)>
5. Center node: 4, Leaf nodes: (9, 3, 0) <4, (9, 3, 0)>
6. Center node: 5, Leaf nodes: (8) <5, (8)>
7. Center node: 6, Leaf nodes: (9, 1, 8) <6, (9, 1, 8)>
8. Center node: 7, Leaf nodes: (9, 0, 8) <7, (9, 0, 8)>
9. Center node: 8, Leaf nodes: (6, 9, 1) <8, (6, 9, 1)>
10. Center node: 9, Leaf nodes: (6, 8, 4) <9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
