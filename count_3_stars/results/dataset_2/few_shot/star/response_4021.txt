Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, thus forming a 3-star.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars (connected to 3 nodes)
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)> (3-star centered at node 1 with nodes 2, 4, and 5 as leaves)
3. Node 2: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)
4. Node 3: No 3-stars (connected to 3 nodes)
5. Node 4: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)
6. Node 5: No 3-stars (connected to 5 nodes)
7. Node 6: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)
8. Node 7: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)
9. Node 8: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)
10. Node 9: No 3-stars (connected to 4 nodes)

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
