Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

Let's first go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0:** Connected to nodes 4 and 2.
2. **Node 1:** Connected to nodes 2 and 5.
3. **Node 2:** Connected to nodes 0, 1, 14, and 10.
4. **Node 3:** Connected to nodes 11, 5, and 8.
5. **Node 4:** Connected to nodes 12, 18, 0, and 6.
6. **Node 5:** Connected to nodes 3 and 1.
7. **Node 6:** Connected to node 4.
8. **Node 7:** Connected to nodes 12, 11, and 19.
9. **Node 8:** Connected to nodes 3, 16, and 10.
10. **Node 9:** Connected to nodes 12, 18, and 14.
11. **Node 10:** Connected to nodes 18, 8, and 2.
12. **Node 11:** Connected to nodes 7, 3, and 15.
13. **Node 12:** Connected to nodes 7, 4, 13, 17, and 9.
14. **Node 13:** Connected to nodes 12 and 16.
15. **Node 14:** Connected to nodes 9, 15, and 2.
16. **Node 15:** Connected to nodes 11, 14, and 17.
17. **Node 16:** Connected to nodes 17, 13, 8, and 19.
18. **Node 17:** Connected to nodes 12, 16, 19, and 15.
19. **Node 18:** Connected to nodes 4, 9, and 10.
20. **Node 19:** Connected to nodes 7, 16, and 17.

Based on the connections above, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <2, (0, 1, 14)>
2. <4, (0, 6, 12)>
3. <7, (11, 12, 19)>
4. <8, (3, 10, 16)>
5. <9, (12, 14, 18)>
6. <12, (4, 17, 9)>
7. <16, (13, 17, 19)>
8. <17, (12, 15, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]

In the given graph, there are 8 unique 3-stars as listed above.
