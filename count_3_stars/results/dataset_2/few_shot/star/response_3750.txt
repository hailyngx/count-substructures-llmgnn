Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (7, 8, 19)>
<1, (7, 0, 16)>
<2, (7, 12, 6)>
<3, (17, 13, 12)>
<4, (12, 9, 16)>
<5, (11, 15, 6)>
<6, (10, 16, 2)>
<7, (1, 0, 16)>
<8, (17, 0, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 16)>
<10, (9, 15, 6)>
<11, (15, 5, 6)>
<12, (3, 4, 19)>
<13, (3, 0, 14)>
<14, (8, 6, 13)>
<15, (10, 19, 11)>
<16, (18, 7, 9)>
<17, (3, 8)>
<18, (16)>
<19, (0, 15, 12)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph gives us [19].
