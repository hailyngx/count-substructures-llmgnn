Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 11, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 10, 14, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 10, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 4, and node 14

Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 11, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 5, 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 4, 13, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 10, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 7
Node 13 is connected to node 10, and node 8
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<2, (6, 10, 14)>
<4, (9, 5, 10)>
<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<7, (6, 12, 1)>
<8, (5, 13, 14)>
<11, (9, 1, 3)>
<12, (3, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
