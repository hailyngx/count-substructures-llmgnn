Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<16, (6, 12, 19)>
<7, (11, 15, 1)>
<10, (11, 12, 2)>
<12, (10, 1, 6)>
<13, (1, 15, 7)>
<8, (19, 14, 18)>
<11, (10, 2, 7)>
<1, (13, 12, 15)>
<19, (8, 14, 6)>
<2, (11, 10, 5)>
<15, (7, 13, 11)>
<9, (16, 17, 3)>
<3, (17, 0, 14)>
<14, (8, 19, 3)>
<5, (17, 2, 0)>
<0, (17, 2, 3)>
<18, (8, 0, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
