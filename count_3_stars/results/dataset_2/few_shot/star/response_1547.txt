Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We can identify a 3-star by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. The center of the 3-star will be that node, and the three neighbors will be the leaves of the star.

Identifying the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 12, 11)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (11, 14, 10)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (9, 8, 13, 5)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (4, 11)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 3)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 10, 14)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (9, 12)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (12, 11, 10, 9)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (13, 2, 14, 10, 0)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (7, 6, 2, 14, 10)
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors (7, 9, 1, 8, 13, 5)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors (7, 1, 3, 0)
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors (7, 6, 13, 14, 0)
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (8, 12, 2, 10, 14)
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors (9, 1, 8, 13, 12, 5)

Nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 1, 5, and 6.

Counting the number of 3-stars:
For node 1:
- (1, 11, 14, 10)
<1, (11, 14, 10)>

For node 5:
- (5, 2, 10, 14)
<5, (2, 10, 14)>

For node 6:
- (6, 9, 12, 13)
<6, (9, 12, 13)>
