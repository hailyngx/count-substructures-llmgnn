Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3)

Node 10 is connected to node 8, 11, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 4, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 12, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 11, 6, 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
    - Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 13, 6, 14
    - Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 12, 7, 14

2. Check if these neighbors have a common neighbor:
    - Nodes 13 and 12 have a common neighbor, node 3.
    - Nodes 7, 6, and 14 do not have a common neighbor.

Considering the nodes that share a common neighbor:
<3, (12, 13, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
