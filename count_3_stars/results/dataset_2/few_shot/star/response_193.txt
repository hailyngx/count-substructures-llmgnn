Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph using the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 8, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<6, (5, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
