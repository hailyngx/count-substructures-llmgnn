Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Find the node degrees:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 3
   - Node 4: degree 1
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 1
   - Node 9: degree 5
   - Node 10: degree 3
   - Node 11: degree 3
   - Node 12: degree 3
   - Node 13: degree 2
   - Node 14: degree 4
   - Node 15: degree 4
   - Node 16: degree 3
   - Node 17: degree 2
   - Node 18: degree 2
   - Node 19: degree 4

2. Identify 3-stars centered at each node:
   - From the degrees, we notice that nodes 0, 8, 4, 7, 13, 17, and 18 cannot be a part of a 3-star since their degrees are less than 3.
   - For the remaining nodes:
     - For node 1: <1, (11, 7, 12)>
     - For node 2: <2, (9, 10, 14)>
     - For node 3: <3, (19, 6, 9)>
     - For node 5: <5, (4, 17, 19)>, <5, (17, 15, 10)>
     - For node 6: <6, (19, 0, 14)>, <6, (0, 3, 14)>
     - For node 9: <9, (2, 1, 12)>, <9, (2, 15, 3)>, <9, (1, 15, 12)>, <9, (3, 15, 12)>
     - For node 10: <10, (2, 5, 19)>
     - For node 11: <11, (16, 7, 15)>
     - For node 12: <12, (13, 1, 9)>
     - For node 14: <14, (13, 2, 18)>, <14, (13, 6, 18)>
     - For node 15: <15, (11, 18, 17)>, <15, (9, 17, 12)>, <15, (17, 9, 18)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total unique 3-stars: 13

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
