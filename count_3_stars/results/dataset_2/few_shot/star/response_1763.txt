Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (5, 9, 1)>
   - <0, (5, 9, 2)>
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (7, 6, 2)>
3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (7, 6, 3)>
4. For Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
6. For Node 5:
   - <5, (9, 0, 3)>
7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
8. For Node 7:
   - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
9. For Node 8:
   - <8, (9, 4, 7)>
10. For Node 9: 
   - <9, (5, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
