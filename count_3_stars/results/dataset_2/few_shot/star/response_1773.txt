Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. A center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We then find the nodes that are connected to the center node, which forms the leaves of the 3-star.

From the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the center nodes and their connected nodes:

1. Center nodes with their connected nodes:
   - Node 3 (connected to nodes 15, 1, and 13)
   - Node 14 (connected to nodes 15, 10, and 11)

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (15, 1, 13)>
<14, (15, 10, 11)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
