Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three leaves.

Count of 3-stars: [14]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 14, 4)>
<1, (8, 6, 11)>
<2, (10, 7, 4)>
<3, (5, 14, 10)>
<4, (9, 11, 1)>
<5, (11, 3, 14)>
<6, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (7, 11, 3)>
<8, (8, 12, 10)>
<9, (9, 13, 4)>
<10, (10, 12, 8)>
<11, (11, 4, 5)>
<12, (12, 14, 10)>
<13, (13, 0, 9)>
