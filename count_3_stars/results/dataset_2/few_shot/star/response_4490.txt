Response:
Following the provided adjacency list, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The nodes that form 3-stars are:
- Node 0: (8, 6, 12), (8, 3, 0), (6, 10, 0), (6, 1, 0)
- Node 1: (8, 6, 12), (8, 4, 1), (6, 10, 1), (6, 12, 1), (4, 11, 1)
- Node 2: (9, 10, 2), (9, 7, 2), (10, 4, 2), (10, 2, 0), (2, 14, 2)
- Node 3: (10, 13, 3), (13, 11, 3), (3, 0, 3)
- Node 4: (10, 6, 4), (10, 12, 4), (6, 11, 4), (6, 1, 4), (12, 1, 4)
- Node 5: (11, 6, 5), (6, 7, 5)
- Node 6: (5, 11, 6), (11, 8, 6), (5, 7, 6), (11, 4, 6), (11, 10, 6)
- Node 7: (5, 7, 7), (2, 7, 7)
- Node 8: (11, 8, 8), (11, 0, 8)
- Node 9: (13, 9, 9)
- Node 10: (6, 10, 10), (10, 2, 10)
- Node 11: (13, 11, 11), (8, 11, 11), (4, 11, 11)
- Node 12: (4, 12, 12), (0, 12, 12), (1, 12, 12)
- Node 13: (3, 13, 13), (9, 13, 13)
- Node 14: (12, 14, 14), (2, 14, 14), (1, 14, 14)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
