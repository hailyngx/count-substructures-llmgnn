Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. To be the center, a node must have exactly three neighbors as per the definition of a 3-star graph.

Nodes that can be the center of a 3-star:
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 14
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 11, 7
- Node 13 has neighbors: 8, 9, 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- <6, (9, 1, 14)>
- <10, (9, 11, 7)>
- <13, (8, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
