Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes such that each set forms a 3-star. In a 3-star, one node is the center and the other two nodes are the leaves connected only to the center.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node and the given edges in the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 1, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 0, -)>
<8, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
