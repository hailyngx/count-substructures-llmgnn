Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, the central nodes are those with exactly 3 connections. 
From the adjacency list, the central nodes are:
- Node 8 with connections to nodes 4, 2, 5
- Node 0 with connections to nodes 4, 7
- Node 1 with connections to nodes 6, 4, 2
- Node 3 with connections to nodes 7, 5, 2

Step 2: Find the 3-stars for each central node

For Node 8:
- Possible 3-star: (8, 4, 2)
- <8, (4, 2, 5)>

For Node 0:
- Possible 3-star: (0, 4, 7)
- <0, (4, 7, 5)>

For Node 1:
- Possible 3-star: (1, 6, 4) (from 1 connecting to 6 and 4)
- <1, (6, 4, 2)>

For Node 3:
- Possible 3-star: (3, 7, 5)
- <3, (7, 5, 2)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars

There are 4 unique 3-stars identified.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
