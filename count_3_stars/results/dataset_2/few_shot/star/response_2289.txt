Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 14, 10, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 10, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

<0, (12, 14, 10, 3)>
<1, (8, 7, 14)>
<2, (6, 9, 4, 10)>
<3, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 5, 0, 10)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<7, (12, 11, 3, 1)>
<8, (13, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<10, (13, 5, 0, 4)>
<11, (6, 13, 7, 12, 14)>
<12, (7, 0, 11)>
<13, (8, 11, 10)>
<14, (0, 11, 1)>

So, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [14].
