Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Select each node as a potential center and check if it forms a 3-star.
2. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we have a 3-star.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 1.
  - <0, (5, 9, 4)>
  - <0, (5, 9, 1)>
  - <0, (5, 4, 1)>
- Total 3-stars from node 0: 3

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0.
  - <1, (9, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (9, 4, 3)>
  - <1, (9, 4, 2)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- Total 3-stars from node 1: 4

Checking the remaining nodes in a similar manner will give us the total count of 3-stars. 

Total 3-stars in the graph: [7]
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 4, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
