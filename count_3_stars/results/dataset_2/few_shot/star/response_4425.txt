Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 10, 12, and 14.

- We will check each of these nodes:
    1. Node 5: Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 3, and 7.
    2. Node 10: Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 13, and 14.
    3. Node 12: Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 13.
    4. Node 14: Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (8, 3, 7)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<12, (9, 2, 13)>
<14, (9, 10, 7)>
