Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. We will then count the 3-stars that are formed around each center node.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (4, 2, 15)>
- <1, (9, 3, _)>
- <2, (8, 0, _)>
- <3, (9, _, _)>
- <4, (14, 8, 15)>
- <5, (9, 6, 12)>
- <6, (5, 4, 16)>
- <7, (18, 11, 13)>
- <8, (4, 2, 16)>
- <9, (5, 3, 1)>
- <10, (13, _, _)>
- <11, (5, 14, 18)>
- <12, (5, 14, 19)>
- <13, (6, 7, 16)>
- <14, (17, 11, 12)>
- <15, (4, 0, _)>
- <16, (17, 8, 6)>
- <17, (14, _, _)>
- <18, (11, 0, 7)>
- <19, (12, _, _)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars above, we have [19].
