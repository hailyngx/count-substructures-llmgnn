Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's find the 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. <0, (7, 8, 2)> 
2. <1, (4, 7, 6)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 0)>
4. <3, (6, 0, 9)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 1)>
6. <5, (7, 8, 6)>
7. <6, (4, 8, 5)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 9)>
9. <8, (4, 5, 0)>
10. <9, (7, 1, 3)>

Since we've found 10 unique 3-stars, the final count is [10].
