Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that all nodes are connected in 3-stars except for Node 0 and Node 1. Thus, we can enumerate the 3-stars using all other nodes as central nodes.

    - Central Node: 2
        - <2, (9, 7, 13)>
    
    - Central Node: 3
        - <3, (5, 0, 12)>
        - <3, (5, 10, 14)>
        - <3, (0, 10, 12)>
    
    - Central Node: 4
        - <4, (9, 7, 14)>
    
    - Central Node: 5
        - <5, (3, 10, 7)>
    
    - Central Node: 6
        - <6, (7, 8, 12)>
    
    - Central Node: 7
        - <7, (5, 9, 1)>
        - <7, (9, 4, 6)>
        - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
    
    - Central Node: 8
        - <8, (13, 2, 10)>
        - <8, (2, 6, 13)>
    
    - Central Node: 9
        - <9, (4, 7, 12)>
    
    - Central Node: 10
        - <10, (5, 9, 0)>
    
    - Central Node: 11
        - <11, (0, 14, 6)>
    
    - Central Node: 12
        - <12, (9, 3, 6)>
    
    - Central Node: 13
        - <13, (1, 8, 2)>
    
    - Central Node: 14
        - <14, (4, 3, 2)>
   
Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [12].
