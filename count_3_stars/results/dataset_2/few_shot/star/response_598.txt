Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]
