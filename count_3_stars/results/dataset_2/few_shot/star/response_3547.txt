Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph.

The total number of 3-star configurations can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has one central node, we can count the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

From the adjacency list:
- Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 14 do not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Nodes 0, 1, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 18 have 3 neighbors each, and they can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's find the 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:

For Node 0: <0, (4, 18, 19)>
For Node 1: <1, (11, 13, 12)>
For Node 10: <10, (2, 8, 19)>
For Node 11: <11, (1, 2, 15)>
For Node 12: <12, (1, 18, 16)>
For Node 15: <15, (7, 11, 18)>
For Node 18: <18, (4, 15, 7)>
[Number of 3-stars: 7]
