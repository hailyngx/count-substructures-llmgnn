Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 11, 14, 10, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 12, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 12, 5, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 2, 14, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 13, 12, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 14, 7, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by checking each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a 3-star. To be the center of a 3-star, a node must have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the 3-stars below:

<1, (7, 11, 14)>
<2, (1, 4, 12)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<4, (2, 4, 14)>
<5, (3, 6, 13)>
<6, (0, 9, 11)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 9, 13)>
<9, (0, 6, 12)>
<10, (1, 3, 14)>
<11, (1, 6, 14)>
<12, (2, 7, 9)>
<13, (3, 5, 7)>
<14, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
