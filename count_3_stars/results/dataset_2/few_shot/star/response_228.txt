Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (17, 7, 10)>
<1, (13, 11, 4)>
<3, (9, 5, 12)>
<4, (8, 2, 10)>
<5, (17, 19, 12)>
<6, (8, 16, 10)>
<7, (0, 9, 17)>
<8, (14, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 16)>
<10, (4, 0, 6)>
<11, (19, 13, 1)>
<12, (5, 9, 19)>
<13, (4, 11, 1)>
<14, (15, 17, 8)>
<15, (19, 14, 16)>
<16, (15, 9, 6)>
<17, (14, 0, 5)>
<18, (19, 6)>
<19, (15, 18, 11)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
