Response:
The 3-star graph in this case refers to a graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the provided graph:

1. <3, (15, 9, 4)>
2. <15, (3, 2, 29)>
3. <6, (9, 12, 13)>
4. <9, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <2, (15, 29, 26)>
6. <29, (2, 16, 10)>
7. <28, (9, 18, 8)>
8. <7, (12, 5, 1)>
9. <12, (6, 7, 21)>
10. <26, (2, 25, 11)>
11. <1, (7, 25, 14)>
12. <10, (16, 21, 22)>
13. <21, (12, 10, 4)>
14. <25, (26, 1, 27)>
15. <17, (19, 22, 18)>
16. <23, (0, 24, 20)>
17. <5, (7, 21, 27)>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
