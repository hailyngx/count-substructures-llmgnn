Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify a 3-star by looking at each node and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (3, 24, 8)>
<2, (23, 19, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 15)>
<4, (9, 2, -)>
<5, (3, 15, 17)>
<6, (9, 7, -)>
<7, (6, 14, 29)>
<8, (15, 28, 26)>
<9, (6, 29, 4)>
<10, (18, 23, -)>
<11, (17, 23, 27)>
<12, (14, 24, -)>
<13, (22, 21, -)>
<14, (7, 12, 24)>
<15, (8, 5, 28)>
<16, (25, 28, 19)>
<17, (5, 29, 11)>
<18, (25, 10, 23)>
<19, (21, 16, 2)>
<20, (14, 18, 5)>
<21, (13, 22, 19)>
<22, (13, 27, 21)>
<23, (10, 11, 18)>
<24, (1, 14, 12)>
<25, (7, 26, 16)>
<26, (25, 8, -)>
<27, (22, 9, 11)>
<28, (15, 16, 8)>
<29, (7, 17, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star subgraphs, we get 29 in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
