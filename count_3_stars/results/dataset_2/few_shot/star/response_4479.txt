Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 6 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

The central node of the 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 1, 2)
2. For node 2: (2, 1, 8)
3. For node 3: (3, 7, 0)
4. For node 4: (4, 1, 5)
5. For node 5: (5, 2, 9)
6. For node 6: (6, 0, 8)
7. For node 7: (7, 3, 9)
8. For node 8: (8, 2, 9)
9. For node 9: (9, 5, 7)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have:
<0, (1, 2)> <2, (1, 8)> <3, (7, 0)> <4, (1, 5)> <5, (2, 9)> <6, (0, 8)> <7, (3, 9)> <8, (2, 9)> <9, (5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
