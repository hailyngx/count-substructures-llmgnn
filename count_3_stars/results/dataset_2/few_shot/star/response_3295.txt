Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star: <14, (17, 4, 5)>
2. Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 3, forming a 3-star: <17, (14, 13, 3)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 12, and 9, forming a 3-star: <4, (14, 12, 9)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 15, forming a 3-star: <7, (3, 11, 15)>
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 19, forming a 3-star: <10, (14, 4, 19)>
6. Node 12 is connected to nodes 18, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star: <12, (18, 4, 5)>
7. Node 5 is connected to nodes 14, 3, and 12, forming a 3-star: <5, (14, 3, 12)>
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 15, forming a 3-star: <9, (17, 4, 15)>
9. Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 7, and 11, forming a 3-star: <15, (13, 7, 11)>
10. Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 16, and 6, forming a 3-star: <18, (2, 16, 6)>
11. Node 0 is connected to node 16, which is less: Skipped
12. Node 1 is connected to node 3, which is less: Skipped
13. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 18, which is less: Skipped
14. Node 3 forms a 3-star, already counted
15. Node 6 forms a 3-star, already counted
16. Node 8 forms a 3-star, already counted
17. Node 11 forms a 3-star, already counted
18. Node 13 forms a 3-star, already counted
19. Node 16 forms a 3-star, already counted
20. Node 19 forms a 3-star, already counted

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. So, <14, (17, 4, 5)>, <17, (14, 13, 3)>, <4, (14, 12, 9)>, <7, (3, 11, 15)>, <10, (14, 4, 19)>, <12, (18, 4, 5)>, <5, (14, 3, 12)>, <9, (17, 4, 15)>, <15, (13, 7, 11)>, <18, (2, 16, 6)>
