Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 11: <4, (1, 8, 11)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 14: <8, (9, 4, 14)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 4: <1, (6, 14, 4)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 3: <5, (6, 13, 3)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 13: <7, (5, 14, 13)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4: <2, (9, 3, 4)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 6: <0, (1, 12, 6)>
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 0: <12, (13, 10, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
