Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by finding the number of 3-stars connected to each node and summing them up. 

Here is the count of 3-stars connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 0
- Node 13: 0
- Node 14: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13. 

[13]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (8, 5, 1)>
<2, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (11, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<6, (3, 12, 14)>
<7, (11, 14, 9)>
<8, (10, 0, 12)>
<9, (7, 3, 13)>
<11, (7, 3, 13)>
<12, (4, 8, 6)>
<13, (11, 2, 9)>
<14, (7, 1, 10)>
