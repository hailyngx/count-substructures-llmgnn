Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's do that step by step.

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 9), (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 1), (0, 5, 3), (0, 9, 8), (0, 9, 1), (0, 9, 4), (0, 9, 5), (0, 7, 5), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 1), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 9, 8), (1, 9, 4), (1, 9, 0), (1, 9, 3), (1, 8, 5), (1, 8, 2), (1, 8, 5), (1, 8, 9), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 0), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 5, 8), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 0), (2, 6, 5)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 1), (3, 4, 0), (3, 7, 0), (3, 1, 9), (3, 1, 8), (3, 1, 0), (3, 0, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 0), (4, 6, 5), (4, 9, 8), (4, 9, 1), (4, 9, 0)
6. Node 5: (5, 6, 2), (5, 6, 0), (5, 6, 4), (5, 2, 8), (5, 2, 6), (5, 8, 9)
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 4), (6, 5, 2), (6, 5, 0), (6, 5, 2)
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it only has 2 connections.
9. Node 8: (8, 5, 9), (8, 5, 1), (8, 5, 2), (8, 9, 4), (8, 9, 1), (8, 9, 0)
10. Node 9: (9, 8, 5), (9, 8, 1), (9, 8, 2), (9, 5, 4), (9, 5, 1), (9, 5, 0)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:  
[<0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 9, 8>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 0, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 0, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 9, 1>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 5, 4>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 5, 0>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 5, 1>, <8, 5, 2>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 8, 5>, <9, 8, 1>, <9, 5, 4>]
