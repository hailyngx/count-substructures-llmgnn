Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (11, 7, 10)>
<7, (3, 0, 19)>
<10, (11, 3, 18)>
<11, (10, 3, 5)>
<12, (16, 9, 15)>
<13, (1, 4, 18)>
<14, (19, 6, 0)>
<15, (5, 12, 8)>
<16, (6, 12, 9)>
<17, (9, 19, 7)>
<18, (10, 13, 2)>
<19, (10, 17, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
