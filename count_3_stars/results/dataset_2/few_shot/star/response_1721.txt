Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 13)>
<1, (18, 16, 7)>
<2, (6, 10, 15)>
<4, (6, 10, 18)>
<10, (17, 15, 4)>
<12, (16, 4, 3)>
<13, (9, 8, 14)>
<14, (8, 13, 15)>
<15, (10, 0, 14)>
<16, (6, 17, 12)>
<18, (4, 7, 1)>
<19, (8, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [12].
