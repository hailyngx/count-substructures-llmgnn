Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16)

Response:
The center of a 3-star can be any of the nodes in the graph. We will now go through each node and identify the 3-stars that can be formed around it. 

Based on the given data, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (15, 10, 16)>
<15, (3, 18, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 18)>
<9, (6, 7, 13)>
<10, (3, 4, 16)>
<11, (5, 2, 19)>
<5, (11, 7, 12)>
<2, (11, 19, 14)>
<18, (15, 6, 4)>
<4, (10, 2, 16)>
<0, (5)>
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<7, (9, 13, 5)>
<12, (6, 5)>
<13, (15, 8, 7)>
<14, (8, 2, 16)>
<16, (3, 4, 14)>
<19, (2, 5)>

As we've gone through each node, the count of unique 3-stars found is 17. Therefore, the answer is [17].
