Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges and adjacency lists, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 3, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (6, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<6, (5, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 2, 6)>
<8, (6, 4, 3)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 3, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the graph.
