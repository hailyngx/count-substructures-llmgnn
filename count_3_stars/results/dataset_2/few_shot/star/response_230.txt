Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 
First, we'll identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star structures. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the possible 3-star structures involving each node:
- Node 0: (0, 5, 6), (0, 1, 12)
- Node 1: (1, 2, 13), (1, 0, 12)
- Node 2: (2, 4, 6), (2, 11, 1), (2, 14, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 5, 8), (3, 9, 14), (3, 13, 11)
- Node 4: (4, 2), none
- Node 5: (5, 7, 6), (5, 0, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 2, 5), none
- Node 7: (7, 11, 8), (7, 10, 14), (7, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 7, 9), (8, 11, 3), (8, 3, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 8, 14), (9, 3, 12), (9, 1, 13)
- Node 10: (10, 7, 14), (10, 12, 0)
- Node 11: (11, 7, 8), (11, 13, 3), (11, 2, 1)
- Node 12: (12, 9, 13), (12, 1, 14), (12, 10, 0)
- Node 13: (13, 3, 11), (13, 1, 12), (13, 12, 9)
- Node 14: (14, 9, 3), (14, 12, 2), (14, 10, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-star structures in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 1)>, <0, (5, 6, 12)>, <1, (2, 13, 1)>, <1, (2, 13, 12)>, <2, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (11, 1, 2)>, <2, (14, 4, 2)>, <3, (5, 8, 3)>, <3, (9, 14, 3)>, <3, (13, 11, 3)>, <5, (7, 6, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (11, 8, 7)>, <7, (10, 14, 7)>, <7, (5, 8, 7)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>, <8, (11, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (8, 14, 9)>, <9, (3, 12, 9)>, <9, (1, 13, 9)>, <10, (7, 14, 10)>, <10, (12, 0, 10)>, <11, (7, 8, 11)>, <11, (13, 3, 11)>, <11, (2, 1, 11)>, <12, (9, 13, 12)>, <12, (1, 14, 12)>, <12, (10, 0, 12)>, <13, (3, 11, 13)>, <13, (1, 12, 13)>, <13, (12, 9, 13)>, <14, (9, 3, 14)>, <14, (12, 2, 14)>, <14, (10, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
