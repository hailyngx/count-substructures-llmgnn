Response:
Step 1: Identify potential 3-stars  
Potential 3-stars are sets where the center node is linked to three other nodes. 

Step 2: Check which potential 3-stars are valid  
For a potential 3-star to be valid, all three edges must exist in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the potential 3-stars:

<5, (9, 15, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<6, (9, 7, 11)>
<4, (6, 7, 17)>
<7, (6, 4, 14)>
<13, (9, 3, 1)>
<14, (5, 7, 11)>
<18, (7, 15, 14)>
<17, (4, 10, 19)>
<10, (17, 1, 19)>
<19, (10, 17, 11)>

Step 3: Validate the potential 3-stars  
After checking the edges of the graph, the valid 3-stars are:

<5, (9, 15, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<6, (9, 7, 11)>
<4, (6, 7, 17)>
<7, (6, 4, 14)>
<13, (9, 3, 1)>
<14, (5, 7, 11)>
<18, (7, 15, 14)>
<17, (4, 10, 19)>
<10, (17, 1, 19)>
<19, (10, 17, 11)>

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars  
Counting the number of valid 3-stars, we get a total of 11.

Therefore, the answer is [11].
