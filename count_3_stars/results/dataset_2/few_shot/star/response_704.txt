Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<3, (9, 8, 19)>
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<8, (13, 2, 3)>
<13, (8, 2, 15)>
<15, (13, 18, 1)>
<17, (12, 2, 4)>
<18, (13, 6, 15)>
<16, (6, 0, 14)>
<1, (6, 17, 15)>
<4, (14, 16, 17)>
<10, (7, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
