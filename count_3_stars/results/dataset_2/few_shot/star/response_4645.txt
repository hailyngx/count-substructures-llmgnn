Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the central node and its neighbors for each node.
- For each node, find the nodes that are connected to it.

Node 0: (2, 15, 1)
Node 1: (5, 0, 17, 10, 18)
Node 2: (0, 11)
Node 3: (13, 5, 14, 10)
Node 4: (19)
Node 5: (19, 1, 3, 7)
Node 6: (7, 15)
Node 7: (8, 5, 6)
Node 8: (14, 7, 18)
Node 9: (13, 16, 11)
Node 10: (1, 3)
Node 11: (2, 17, 19, 9)
Node 12: (16, 18, 15)
Node 13: (3, 9, 14)
Node 14: (8, 13, 3, 15)
Node 15: (6, 0, 12, 14)
Node 16: (12, 9)
Node 17: (1, 11)
Node 18: (8, 1, 12)
Node 19: (5, 11, 4)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- Look for each node if it has exactly three neighbors and if those neighbors are not connected to each other. This configuration forms a 3-star.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
[11]

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
