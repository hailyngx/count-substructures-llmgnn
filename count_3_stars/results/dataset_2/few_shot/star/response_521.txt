Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 18, 14)>
<0, (2, 18, 1)>
<0, (2, 14, 0)>
<0, (18, 14, 1)>
<5, (2, 15, 16)>
<5, (2, 15, 13)>
<5, (15, 16, 17)>
<5, (15, 16, 13)>
<5, (15, 16, 1)>
<5, (15, 16, 7)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<9, (11, 10, 13)>
<9, (11, 12, 6)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<11, (10, 14, 1)>
<11, (10, 14, 16)>
<11, (10, 14, 19)>
<11, (10, 14, 3)>
<11, (10, 14, 17)>
<11, (10, 14, 6)>
<12, (3, 8, 15)>
<12, (3, 8, 6)>
<12, (8, 9, 15)>
<12, (9, 11, 13)>
<12, (9, 11, 3)>
<13, (5, 18, 2)>
<13, (5, 18, 12)>
<13, (5, 18, 13)>
<13, (11, 9, 10)>
<17, (16, 19, 6)>
<17, (16, 19, 17)>
<17, (16, 5, 15)>
<17, (16, 5, 13)>
<17, (16, 5, 1)>
<17, (16, 5, 7)>
<17, (16, 5, 12)>
<17, (15, 5, 13)>
<17, (15, 5, 1)>

By counting the identified unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [33] 3-stars in the given graph.
