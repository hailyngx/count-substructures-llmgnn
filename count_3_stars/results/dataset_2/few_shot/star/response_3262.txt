Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These central nodes will form the centers of the 3-star graphs.

The central nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 13, 16, 11)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 19, 8, 18)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 5, 17, 12)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 5, 14, 11)

Now, let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <0, (13, 16, 18)>
- <0, (13, 16, 11)>
- <0, (13, 11, 18)>

- <1, (19, 8, 18)>
- <1, (19, 8, 10)>

- <3, (5, 17, 12)>
- <3, (5, 17, 13)>
- <3, (5, 17, 3)>
- <3, (5, 3, 12)>

- <4, (5, 14, 11)>
- <4, (5, 14, 17)>
- <4, (5, 14, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [12].
