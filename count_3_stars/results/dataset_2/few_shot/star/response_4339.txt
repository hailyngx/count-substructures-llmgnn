Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. 
Here are the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 1
- Node 23: 1
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: 1
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: 1
- Node 29: 1

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30]. 

Now, we list the unique 3-stars that were found:
<0, (17, 4, 19)>
<1, (3, 15, 16)>
<2, (13, 22, 19)>
<3, (1, 27, 16)>
<4, (11, 2, 0)>
<5, (26, 14, 25)>
<6, (18, 13, 20)>
<7, (24, 7, 23)>
<8, (13, 24, 20)>
<9, (18, 10, 12)>
<10, (9, 11, 12)>
<11, (10, 4, 2)>
<12, (9, 10)>
<13, (6, 8, 2)>
<14, (28, 5)>
<15, (1, 28)>
<16, (1, 21, 27)>
<17, (29, 0, 19)>
<18, (6, 9, 21)>
<19, (17, 29, 2)>
<20, (8, 13, 24)>
<21, (26, 16, 18)>
<22, (2, 25)>
<23, (7, 18)>
<24, (8, 26, 7)>
<25, (22, 27)>
<26, (24, 5, 20)>
<27, (3, 8, 16)>
<28, (1, 15)>
<29, (17, 19)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
