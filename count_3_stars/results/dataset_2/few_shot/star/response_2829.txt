Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 1, 8)>
2. <1, (9, 5, 4)>
3. <2, (6, 5, 4)>
4. <3, (9, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (6, 1, 3)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
7. <6, (7, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (6, 9, 5)>
9. <8, (6, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (3, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
