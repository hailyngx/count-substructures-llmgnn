Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph:

First, we identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which are the nodes with a degree of 3:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 13, 11, and 19
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 14 and 15

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs for each central node:
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (nodes 13, 11, and 19)
  - <1, (13, 11, 19)>
  - Total: 1 3-star graph

- Node 10: Has 2 neighbors (nodes 14 and 15)
  - <10, (14, 15, NOT A STAR)> (Doesn't form a 3-star)
  - Total: 0 3-star graphs

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [1].
