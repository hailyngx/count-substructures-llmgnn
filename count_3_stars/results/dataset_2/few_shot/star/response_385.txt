Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.  
The 3-stars in this graph can be identified by finding nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
To count the number of 3-stars, we identify each unique 3-star in the graph and count them.

Let's find the unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
Since we have found 10 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
