Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's go step by step to identify the 3-stars.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (potential centers of 3-stars):
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 6
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9

Identifying the 3-stars:
1. For Node 4:
   - <4, (9, 1, 6)>
   
2. For Node 7:
   - <7, (9, 5, 0)>
   
3. For Node 8:
   - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
