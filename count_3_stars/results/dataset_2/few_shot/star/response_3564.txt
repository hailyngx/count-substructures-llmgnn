Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 12, 14, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 12, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 10, 13, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 1, 10, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 0, 14, 13, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 11, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 14, 1, 6, 4, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, 10, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 8, and node 10

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 14. <0, (7, 12, 14)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 12. <2, (5, 9, 12)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 13. <4, (6, 10, 13)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 14, and 4. <7, (8, 14, 4)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 14. <9, (11, 8, 14)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
