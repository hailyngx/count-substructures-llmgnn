Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (21, 23, 24)>
<3, (15, 22, 29)>
<10, (9, 11, 5)>
<11, (10, 17, 6)>
<15, (1, 9, 29)>
<19, (5, 7, 22)>
<22, (2, 6, 19)>
<23, (1, 27, 29)>
<25, (12, 27, 29)>
<26, (0, 8, 20)>
<27, (2, 14, 23)>
<28, (8, 9, 21)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [12]
