Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (0, 8, 2)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 6)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
