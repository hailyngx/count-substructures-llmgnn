Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (19, 28, 24)>
<1, (5, 18, 19)>
<2, (22, 12, 17)>
<3, (13, 12, 14)>
<4, (22, 21, 19)>
<5, (6, 23, 1)>
<6, (5, 15, 29)>
<7, (8, 9, 17)>
<8, (10, 12, 13)>
<9, (15, 16, 27)>
<10, (11, 23, 8)>
<11, (10, 18, 19)>
<12, (3, 15, 25)>
<13, (3, 8, 14)>
<14, (3, 18, 29)>
<15, (6, 9, 12)>
<16, (20, 27, 9)>
<17, (8, 22, 7)>
<18, (1, 14, 20)>
<19, (0, 4, 11)>
