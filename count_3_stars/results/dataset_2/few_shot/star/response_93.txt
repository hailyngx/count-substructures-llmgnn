Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Choose the central node from all nodes.
2. For each central node, find all possible triples of connected nodes (3 stars).
3. Repeat for each central node.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<4, (10, 3, 13)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 14, 13)>
<7, (0, 11, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (7, 3, 13)>
<10, (4, 3, 13)>
<11, (7, 5, 14)>
<12, (6, 2, 9)>
<13, (6, 0, 11)>
<14, (6, 11, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: 15
