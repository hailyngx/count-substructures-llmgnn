Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Calculate the degree of each node by counting how many edges are incident to it.
2. Identify the nodes that have a degree of 3, as these can be potential central nodes of 3-stars.
3. For each potential central node, check if it is indeed part of a 3-star by examining its neighbors. If three of its neighbors are connected to it but not connected to each other, then it forms a 3-star.
4. List the unique 3-stars found. 

Let's start the process. 

Calculating node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Identifying potential central nodes (degree 3):
- Node 5

Checking 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8, but nodes 2, 7, and 8 are not connected to each other. Thus, <5, (2, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
