Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves) connected to them. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

- Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12

2. For each potential central node, check their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star.

- For node 4: (4, 0, 10, 5) - Not a 3-star
- For node 5: (5, 4, 12, 11) - Not a 3-star
- For node 6: (6, 7, 3, 14) - Not a 3-star
- For node 8: (8, 12, 11, 10) - Not a 3-star
- For node 9: (9, 3, 11, 14) - Not a 3-star
- For node 11: (11, 3, 14, 1) - <11, (3, 14, 1)>
- For node 12: (12, 13, 5, 8) - Not a 3-star

3. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Final answer inside brackets: [1]
Unique 3-stars found: <11, (3, 14, 1)>
