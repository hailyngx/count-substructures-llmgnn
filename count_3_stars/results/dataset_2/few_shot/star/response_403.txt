Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 11) (9, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 10, 8, 2, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 2, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 5, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 10, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 2, 6, 13, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 3, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 10, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 11, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 9, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 5, 14, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 12, 6, 0, and node 3

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 10, 8)>
<1, (11, 2, 13)>
<2, (11, 5, 1)>
<3, (7, 8, 12)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (12, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 5)>
<7, (4, 12, 3)>
<8, (4, 10, 0)>
<9, (11, 1, 13)>
<10, (4, 0, 8)>
<11, (1, 9, 13)>
<12, (7, 5, 14)>
<13, (5, 1, 9)>
<14, (7, 12, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [14].
