Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, and 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, and 3
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 6

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
