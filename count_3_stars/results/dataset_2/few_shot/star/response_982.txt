Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (11, 4, 10)>
<1, (16, 4, 19)>
<2, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (15, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, -)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<6, (16, 5, 10)>
<7, (10, -, 18)>
<8, (11, 9, 18)>
<9, (15, 14, 8)>
<10, (7, 6, 0)>
<11, (16, 0, 8)>
<12, (3, -, 10)>
<13, (15, 14, 1)>
<14, (17, 9, 13)>
<15, (3, 9, 13)>
<16, (11, 1, 6)>
<18, (7, 8, 1)>
<19, (0, 1, -)>

Since we have found 18 unique instances of 3-stars in the graph, the answer is [18].
