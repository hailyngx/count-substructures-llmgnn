Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in this graph. A node can be the center of a 3-star if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list, the following nodes can be the center of a 3-star: 4, 5, and 18.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars.
For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3. Thus, <4, (9, 1, 3)> is a 3-star with node 4 as the center.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 7. Thus, <5, (13, 17, 7)> is a 3-star with node 5 as the center.

For node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 19. Thus, <18, (1, 4, 19)> is a 3-star with node 18 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (13, 17, 7)>, <18, (1, 4, 19)>.
