Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

2. Count all the unique 3-stars found.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<9, (26, 6, 24)>
<26, (9, 5, 23)>
<6, (9, 3, 24)>
<0, (27, 18, 19)>
<27, (0, 29, 18)>
<10, (11, 19, 25)>
<11, (10, 23, 5)>
<2, (21, 18, 12)>
<18, (0, 27, 16)>
<17, (2, 23, 17)>
<4, (21, 6, 16)>
<5, (26, 11, 20)>
<7, (3, 28, 23)>
<8, (18, 20, 26)>
<12, (2, 13, 29)>
<13, (15, 12, 29)>
<14, (1, 7, 28)>
<15, (13)>
<16, (18, 4, 0)>
<19, (0, 10, 22)>
<20, (26, 5, 8)>
<21, (4, 2, 29)>
<22, (19, 24)>
<23, (26, 11, 17)>
<24, (9, 6, 28)>
<25, (9, 10)>
<28, (7, 14, 24)>
<29, (21, 27, 13)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [27]
