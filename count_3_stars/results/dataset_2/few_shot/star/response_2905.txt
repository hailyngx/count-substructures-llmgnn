Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<7, (6, 3, 0)>
<8, (9, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
