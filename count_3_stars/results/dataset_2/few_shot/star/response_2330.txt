Response:
The central node of a 3-star can have at most 4 edges incident on it, and the leaves (outer nodes) of a 3-star can only have one edge incident on them. 

Given the adjacency list, we can determine how many 3-stars are formed around each node. 
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 1: 3 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <1, (17, 18, 13)>, <1, (17, 19, 1)>, <1, (17, 1, 13)>)
- Node 2: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <2, (16, 17, 5)>, <2, (17, 1, 13)>)
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 5: 3 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <5, (14, 2, 7)>, <5, (14, 5, 13)>, <5, (2, 5, 7)>)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (Possible 3-star: <7, (12, 15, 5)>)
- Node 8: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <8, (12, 15, 19)>, <8, (12, 8, 15)>)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (Possible 3-star: <9, (17, 10, 3)>)
- Node 10: 1 3-star (Possible 3-star: <10, (14, 9, 4)>)
- Node 11: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 12: 1 3-star (Possible 3-star: <12, (11, 8, 7)>)
- Node 13: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 14: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <14, (17, 10, 5)>, <14, (17, 3, 10)>)
- Node 15: 1 3-star (Possible 3-star: <15, (12, 4, 7)>)
- Node 16: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <16, (2, 17, 5)>, <16, (2, 19, 1)>)
- Node 17: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <17, (14, 1, 13)>, <17, (14, 2, 1)>)
- Node 18: 0 3-stars (Not the center of any 3-star)
- Node 19: 2 3-stars (Possible 3-stars: <19, (16, 6, 1)>, <19, (16, 1, 8)>)

So, there are a total of [16] unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (17, 18, 13)>, <1, (17, 19, 1)>, <1, (17, 1, 13)>, 
<2, (16, 17, 5)>, <2, (17, 1, 13)>, 
<5, (14, 2, 7)>, <5, (14, 5, 13)>, <5, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (12, 15, 5)>, 
<8, (12, 15, 19)>, <8, (12, 8, 15)>, 
<9, (17, 10, 3)>, 
<10, (14, 9, 4)>, 
<12, (11, 8, 7)>, 
<14, (17, 10, 5)>, <14, (17, 3, 10)>, 
<15, (12, 4, 7)>, 
<16, (2, 17, 5)>, <16, (2, 19, 1)>, 
<17, (14, 1, 13)>, <17, (14, 2, 1)>, 
<19, (16, 6, 1)>, <19, (16, 1, 8)>
