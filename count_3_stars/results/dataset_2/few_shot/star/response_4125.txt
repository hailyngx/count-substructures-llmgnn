Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 

Given the adjacency list, we can see that the central node must have exactly three neighbors to form a 3-star.

From the adjacency list, we can deduce the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
