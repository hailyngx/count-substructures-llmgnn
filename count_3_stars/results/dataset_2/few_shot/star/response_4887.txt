Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and its neighboring nodes. Then we will check for each combination of the neighboring nodes if they form a 3-star with the central node.

Central nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: (16, 22, 19)
- Node 1: (21, 24, 27)
- Node 2: (25, 3)
- Node 3: (18, 20) 
- Node 4: (24, 25, 15)
- Node 5: (18, 23, 28)
- Node 6: (9, 11, 20)
- Node 7: (23, 13)
- Node 8: (1, 17)
- Node 9: (6, 15, 28)
- Node 10: (27, 15, 23)
- Node 11: (21, 6)
- Node 12: (21, 14, 27)
- Node 13: (7)
- Node 14: (22, 12, 15)
- Node 15: (14, 4, 9, 10)
- Node 16: (0, 29, 25, 23)
- Node 17: (25, 8, 22)
- Node 18: (5, 3)
- Node 19: (0, 29, 20)
- Node 20: (6, 19, 26, 3)
- Node 21: (1, 12, 11)
- Node 22: (14, 17, 0)
- Node 23: (7, 10, 16, 5)
- Node 24: (1, 4, 5)
- Node 25: (17, 4, 16, 26, 2)
- Node 26: (25, 20, 29)
- Node 27: (1, 12, 10)
- Node 28: (9, 5)
- Node 29: (16, 19, 26)

Now let's find the 3-stars:
<0, (16, 22, 19)>
<1, (21, 24, 27)>
<2, (25, 3, 18)>
<3, (18, 20, 5)>
<4, (24, 25, 15)>
<5, (18, 23, 28)>
<6, (9, 11, 20)>
<7, (23, 13)>
<8, (1, 17, 22)>
<9, (6, 15, 28)>
<10, (27, 15, 23)>
<11, (21, 6, 12)>
<12, (21, 14, 27)>
<13, (7)>
<14, (22, 12, 15)>
<15, (14, 4, 9)>
<16, (0, 29, 25)>
<17, (25, 2, 8)>
<18, (5, 3, 20)>
<19, (0, 29, 26)>
<20, (6, 19, 26)>
<21, (1, 12, 11)>
<22, (17, 0, 14)>
<23, (7, 16, 5)>
<24, (1, 5, 4)>
<25, (17, 16, 26)>
<26, (29, 25, 20)>
<27, (1, 12, 10)>
<28, (9, 5, 2)>
<29, (16, 19, 26)>
