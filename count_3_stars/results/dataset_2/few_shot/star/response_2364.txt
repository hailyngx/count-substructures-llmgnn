Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 5. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center.  
2. Node 3 is also connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9. This forms another 3-star with node 3 as the center.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 6. This forms a third 3-star with node 5 as the center.  

Putting it all together, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
