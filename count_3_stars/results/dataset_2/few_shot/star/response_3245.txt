Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (9, 27, 10)>
<2, (21, 4, 7)>
<4, (29, 5, 2)>
<5, (23, 7, 14)>
<7, (2, 17, 5)>
<9, (22, 21, 1)>
<12, (21, 18, 28)>
<13, (9, 17, 0)>
<14, (18, 5, 11)>
<15, (21, 20, 16)>
<16, (23, 22, 15)>
<17, (26, 7, 13)>
<18, (28, 14, 25)>
<19, (22, 0, 26)>
<20, (24, 15, 21)>
<21, (15, 9, 2)>
<22, (19, 9, 26)>
<23, (10, 16, 5)>
<24, (20, 8, 29)>
<25, (18, 29, 26)>
<26, (25, 17, 22)>
<28, (18, 12, 29)>
<29, (25, 24, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
