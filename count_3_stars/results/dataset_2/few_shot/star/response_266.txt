Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the adjacency list, we can see the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2, 5, and 8 as neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4, 6, and 14 as neighbors.
- Node 10 has 1, 5, and 8 as neighbors.

Now, we list all the unique 3-stars based on these nodes:
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<7, (6, 4, 14)>
<10, (1, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
