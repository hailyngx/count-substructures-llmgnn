Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star as the center node. 

Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, the 3-stars can be visualized as follows:

<0, (7, 11, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 11)>
<2, (3, 12, 8)>
<3, (14, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<8, (2, 9, 14)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<10, (4, 8, 5)>
<11, (1, 0, 9)>
<12, (7, 2, 14)>
<13, (5)>
<14, (7, 3, 12)>

This results in 14 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
