Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections between nodes. Now, let's count the 3-stars:

1. The 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 5, 3)>
2. The 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (7, 6, 8)>
3. The 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (6, 9, 8)>
4. The 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (6, 5, 0)>
5. The 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (8, 9, 0)>
6. The 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (8, 1, 0)>
7. The 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (9, 1, 3)>
8. The 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (4, 9, 2)>
9. The 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The count of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
