Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 0, -)>
<3, (6, 0, 4)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
