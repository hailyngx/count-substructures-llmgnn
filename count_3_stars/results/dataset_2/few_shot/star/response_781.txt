Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Considering the definition of a 3-star graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the adjacency list provided.

After examining the adjacency list, we can find the following unique 3-stars:
1. <5, (17, 18, 19)>
2. <4, (11, 16, 10)>
3. <7, (15, 0, 3)>
4. <9, (15, 14, 16)>
5. <12, (0, 14, 18)>
6. <2, (13, 0, 19)>
7. <8, (10, 11, 13)>
8. <1, (17, 14, 18)>
9. <6, (15, 19, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
