Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 5, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the center node of the 3-stars can only be nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 because they have exactly 3 neighboring nodes each.
2. Now, let's check each of these 5 nodes to see if they form 3-stars:
    - Starting with Node 1, the neighbors of Node 1 are 6, 9, 3, 0, and 7. However, node 0 is not connected to any of the other neighbors, so Node 1 does not form any 3-stars.
    - Next, Node 3 has neighbors 1, 7, 5, 8, and 4. None of these sets of nodes forms a 3-star.
    - Similarly, Node 5 has neighbors 6, 3, 8, 2, and 0 that do not form any 3-stars.
    - Moving on to Node 7, its neighbors are 6, 9, 1, and 3. However, no set of nodes forms a 3-star.
    - Finally, Node 9 has neighbors 6, 2, 1, and 7. After checking all combinations, no 3-stars are formed by Node 9 either.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
