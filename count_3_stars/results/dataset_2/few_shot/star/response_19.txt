Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These sets will represent the 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<5, (9, 1, 5)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
