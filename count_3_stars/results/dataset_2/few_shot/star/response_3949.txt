Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars by locating the central node and its leaves. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (9, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<9, (8, 6, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
