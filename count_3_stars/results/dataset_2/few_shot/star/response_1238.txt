Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 1 is part of one 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 6)>.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 4 is part of two 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 8)> and <4, (9, 7, 3)>.
- Node 5 is part of two 3-stars: <5, (2, 8, 1)> and <5, (2, 8, 7)>.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 7 is part of one 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 9 is part of one 3-star: <9, (8, 4, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, and <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
