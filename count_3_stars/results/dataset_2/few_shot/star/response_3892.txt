Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node at the triangles formed with the nodes it's connected to. If a node is the center of a 3-star, it will have exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes in a star-like shape.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by checking each node:
1. Node 0 forms the following 3-stars: <0, (10, 6, 12)>, <0, (10, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms the following 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 2 forms the following 3-stars: <2, (6, 4, 12)>, <2, (6, 4, 1)>
4. Node 3 forms the following 3-stars: <3, (11, 5, 13)>, <3, (5, 13, 7)>, <3, (13, 7, 9)>, <3, (9, 12, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms the following 3-stars: <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. Node 5 forms the following 3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6 forms the following 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 2)>
8. Node 7 forms the following 3-stars: <7, (13, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 9, 12)>, <7, (9, 12, 8)>
9. Node 8 forms the following 3-stars: <8, (12, 9, 7)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (7, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 8, 12)>
10. Node 9 forms the following 3-stars: <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>
11. Node 10 forms the following 3-stars: <10, (0, 6, 12)>, <10, (0, 6, 8)>
12. Node 11 forms the following 3-stars: <11, (3, 5, 13)>, <11, (3, 5, 1)>, <11, (3, 5, 13)>, <11, (5, 13, 7)>, <11, (5, 13, 9)>
13. Node 12 forms the following 3-stars: <12, (2, 6, 1)>, <12, (2, 6, 8)>, <12, (6, 8, 3)>, <12, (8, 3, 11)>, <12, (3, 11, 13)>
14. Node 13 forms the following 3-stars: <13, (5, 3, 7)>, <13, (3, 7, 9)>, <13, (7, 9, 12)>, <13, (9, 12, 11)>
15. Node 14 forms the following 3-stars: <14, (11, 10, 3)>, <14, (10, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (10, 6, 12)>, <0, (10, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (6, 4, 12)>

<6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 4, 2)>
<7, (13, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 9, 12)>, <7, (9, 12, 8)>
<8, (12, 9, 7)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (7, 3, 8)>

<12, (2, 6, 1)>, <12, (2, 6, 8)>, <12, (6, 8, 3)>, <12, (8, 3, 11)>
<13, (5, 3, 7)>, <13, (3, 7, 9)>, <13, (7, 9, 12)>
<14, (11, 10, 3)>, <14, (10, 3, 9)>
