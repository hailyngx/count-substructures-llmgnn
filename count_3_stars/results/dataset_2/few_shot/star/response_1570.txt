Response:
At this point, let's identify the 3-star patterns within the given graph. 

Considering the definition of a 3-star graph where the center node is connected to exactly three leaves, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following potential 3-star patterns: 
<1, (8, 16, 2)>
<2, (10, 1, 4)>
<4, (17, 16, 2)>
<5, (8, 15, 12)>
<7, (13, 19, 0)>
<9, (16, 1, 0)>
<11, (0, 15, 14)>
<13, (8, 19, 7)>
<15, (11, 10, 12)>
<16, (8, 1, 4)>
<18, (3, 19, 0)>
<19, (13, 18, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (8, 16, 2)>
<2, (10, 1, 4)>
<4, (17, 16, 2)>
<5, (8, 15, 12)>
<7, (13, 19, 0)>
<9, (16, 1, 0)>
<11, (0, 15, 14)>
<13, (8, 19, 7)>
<15, (11, 10, 12)>
<16, (8, 1, 4)>
<18, (3, 19, 0)>
<19, (13, 18, 12)>
