Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

First, let's identify the center nodes and their connected nodes:
- Center node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, 4, and 8.
- Center node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 7.
- Center node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0.
- Center node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 4, and 8.
- Center node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 6, and 0.
- Center node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4.
- Center node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 4, and 0.
- Center node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 6, and 2.
- Center node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 0.
- Center node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, and 7. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 7, 0)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>
<7, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
<count(3-stars)>
