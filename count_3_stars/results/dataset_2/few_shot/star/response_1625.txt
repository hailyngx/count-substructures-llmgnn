Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify 3-stars**: A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will go through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star.

2. **Count 3-stars**: For each central node, we will check the nodes it is connected to and see if they form a 3-star. If so, we will count it.

Let's start identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are a total of **7 unique 3-stars** in the graph:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 3, 14)>
- <2, (5, 9, 3)>
- <3, (7, 1, 13)>
- <4, (9, 7, 13)>
- <5, (6, 2, 8)>
- <6, (10, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is **7**.
