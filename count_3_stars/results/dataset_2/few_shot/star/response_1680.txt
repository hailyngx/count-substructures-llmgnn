Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Given the information provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 17
2. Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 3
3. Node 5: Connected to nodes 17, 10, 14
4. Node 8: Connected to nodes 16, 13, 19
5. Node 10: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 19
6. Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 2, 18
7. Node 14: Connected to nodes 8, 5, 7
8. Node 18: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- <1, (9, 3, 17)>
- <4, (6, 9, 3)>
- <5, (17, 10, 14)>
- <8, (16, 13, 19)>
- <10, (1, 5, 19)>
- <13, (8, 2, 18)>
- <14, (8, 5, 7)>
- <18, (6, 9, 3)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars found. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
