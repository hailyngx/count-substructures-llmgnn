Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, 9, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 1, 6, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
We can see from the adjacency list that the nodes and their connections form the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 6, 5)>
<2, (9, 4, -)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (8, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 1)>
<7, (8, 1, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 8, 3)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the graph.
