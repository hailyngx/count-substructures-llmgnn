Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes involved in the 3-stars. Nodes with degree 3 are potential center nodes of 3-stars. Below are the nodes with degree 3:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 6, 2, 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 8, 9, 2)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 4, 9, 1)

Next, we will check the neighbors of each potential center node to see if they form 3-stars. We will enumerate the 3-stars and count them.

For Node 1:
- <1, (6, 2, 0)> - forms a 3-star
- Total: 1

For Node 3:
- <3, (2, 5, 8)> - forms a 3-star
- Total: 2

For Node 4:
- <4, (8, 9, 2)> - forms a 3-star
- Total: 3

For Node 8:
- <8, (4, 9, 1)> - forms a 3-star
- Total: 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
