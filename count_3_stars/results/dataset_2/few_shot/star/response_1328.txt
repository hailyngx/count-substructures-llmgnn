Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (13, 7, 15)>
<1, (5, 9, 19)>
<2, (18, 6, 17)>
<3, (11, 10, 19)>
<4, (5, 9, 19)>
<5, (1, 19, 12)>
<6, (2, 7, 19)>
<7, (8, 0, 19)>
<8, (13, 14, 18)>
<9, (1, 4, 19)>
<10, (3, 19, 12)>
<11, (3, 18, 14)>
<12, (5, 14, 10)>
<13, (0, 8, 16)>
<14, (8, 11, 7)>
<15, (0, 16, 17)>
<16, (13, 19, 15)>
<17, (2, 15, 0)>
<18, (8, 2, 11)>
<19, (7, 5, 10)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, the total count is given by [20].
