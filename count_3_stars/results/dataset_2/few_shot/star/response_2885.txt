Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 14, 3, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 0, 10, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 10, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 12, 4, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 14, 10, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 8, 13, 0, and node 12

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<5, (9, 13, 14)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>, <13, (8, 14, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
