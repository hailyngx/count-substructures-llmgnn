Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes. Each 3-star in the graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5: (0, 3, 15), (6, 17, 5), (5, 15, 19)
2. Node 9: (8, 11, 19), (9, 12, 13)
3. Node 12: (1, 10, 13), (12, 14, 10)
4. Node 14: (6, 12, 18), (14, 17, 18)
5. Node 17: (0, 7, 14), (5, 7, 15)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
<5, (0, 3, 15)>, <9, (8, 11, 19)>, <13, (1, 10, 12)>, <14, (6, 12, 18)>, <17, (0, 7, 14)>, <17, (5, 14, 15)>, <17, (6, 14, 18)>
