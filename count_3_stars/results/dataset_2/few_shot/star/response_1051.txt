Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (14, 7, 18)>
<1, (3, 16, -)>
<2, (17, 19, 6)>
<3, (1, 17, 4)>
<4, (3, 11, 9)>
<5, (14, 7, 15)>
<6, (15, 2, -)>
<7, (17, 0, 5)>
<8, (13, 9, 12)>
<9, (8, 4, 19)>
<10, (11, 17, 15)>
<11, (10, 12, 4)>
<12, (11, 8, -)>
<13, (8, -, -)>
<14, (0, 5, -)>
<15, (10, 0, 6)>
<16, (1, 15, -)>
<17, (3, 10, 2)>
<18, (8, 0, 19)>
<19, (9, 18, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
