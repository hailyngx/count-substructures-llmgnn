Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can form a 3-star in this graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0, with neighbors 4, 12, and 5
- Node 4, with neighbors 7, 8, and 0
- Node 8, with neighbors 4, 7, and 14
- Node 10, with neighbors 13, 5, and no other node

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (4, 12, 5)>
- <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- <8, (4, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
