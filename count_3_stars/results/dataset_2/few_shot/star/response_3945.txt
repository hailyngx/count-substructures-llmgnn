Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves).

Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:

1. <6, (5, 4, 13)>
2. <9, (3, 13, 0)>
3. <4, (6, 7, 1)>
4. <7, (4, 12, 14)>
5. <8, (7, 10, 0)>
6. <12, (7, 2, 10)>
7. <0, (9, 8, 10)>
8. <5, (6, 11, 3)>
9. <2, (7, 12, 10)>
10. <11, (6, 7, 14)>
11. <10, (6, 8, 12)>
12. <3, (9, 8, 12)>
13. <1, (4, 2, -)>
14. <13, (6, 9, -)>
15. <14, (7, 11, -)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
