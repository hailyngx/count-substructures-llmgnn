Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:
- For Node 0: <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 2, 1)>
- For Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 6)>, <1, (9, 2, 0)>
- For Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>
- For Node 3: <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- For Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>
- For Node 6: No 3-stars since it only has 2 neighbors.
- For Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>
- For Node 8: <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>
- For Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
