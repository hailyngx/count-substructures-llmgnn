Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given information, we can see that the possible 3-stars in this graph are created when a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars using the edge connections. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 12, 7)>
<1, (14, 11, 15)>
<1, (14, 15, 5)>
<2, (7, 10, 12)>
<2, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (14, 16, 3)>
<4, (8, 18, 12)>
<5, (17, 1, 2)>
<6, (9, 17, 0)>
<7, (12, 18, 2)>
<8, (13, 4, 18)>
<9, (6, 18, 9)>
<10, (15, 2, 16)>
<11, (12, 1, 11)>
<13, (8, 19, 13)>
<14, (17, 19, 5)>
<15, (17, 1, 15)>
<16, (3, 10, 16)>
<17, (14, 19, 5)>
<18, (9, 4, 7)>
<19, (14, 17, 13)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us the answer: [21].
