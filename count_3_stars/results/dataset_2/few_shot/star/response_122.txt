Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (9, 6, 0)>
5. <4, (1, 8, 0)>
6. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
7. <6, (5, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (9, 1, 0)>
9. <8, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
