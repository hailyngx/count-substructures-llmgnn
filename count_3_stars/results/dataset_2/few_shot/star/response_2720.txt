Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 14: <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 7: <10, (11, 0, 7)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 5, and 14: <10, (11, 5, 14)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 2: <10, (11, 7, 2)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 13: <5, (1, 3, 13)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 14: <13, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 13: <10, (5, 2, 13)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 5, and 14: <4, (13, 5, 14)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
