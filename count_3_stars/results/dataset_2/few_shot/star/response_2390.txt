Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we will iterate through each node and check its neighbors to see if there is a 3-star centered at that node. 

Let's start with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 2. 
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0 since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 12.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 1 since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.

Continuing this process for each node results in the following number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (8, 13, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 7, 14)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 10, 11)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 13, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 4, 14)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 14)>
- Node 10: <10, (0, 6, 11)>
- Node 11: <11, (6, 10, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (1, 9, 11)>
- Node 13: <13, (4, 2, 7)>
- Node 14: <14, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
