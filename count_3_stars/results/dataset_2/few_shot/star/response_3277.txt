Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (25, 24, 6)>
2. <1, (21, 28, 8)>
3. <2, (14, 12, 13)>
4. <3, (2)>
5. <4, (8, 23, 22)>
6. <5, (18)>
7. <6, (10)>
8. <7, (22)>
9. <9, (25, 15)>
10. <11, (26)>
11. <16, (14, 12, 19)>
12. <17, (23, 18, 19)>
13. <20, (21, 25)>
14. <27, (28, 29, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
