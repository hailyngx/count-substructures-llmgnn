Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will go through each node in the adjacency list and check if it forms a 3-star by having exactly three edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (1)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<4, (9, 8, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
