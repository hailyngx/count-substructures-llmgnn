Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 11, 0, 14, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 8, 13, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 12, 13, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 14, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 8, 12, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 11, 10, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 9, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 7, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 14, 7, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 14, 4, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, 12, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star within the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<9, (6, 2, 11)>
<10, (9, 11, 1)>
<11, (9, 10, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 14)>
<0, (14, 1, 6)>
<2, (9, 8, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 3)>
<7, (11, 8, 12)>
<12, (14, 7, 4)>
<13, (14, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
