Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (11, 15, 7)>
<5, (16, 9, 18)>
<6, (9, 10, 19)>
<7, (16, 17, 13)>
<9, (6, 5, 14)>
<10, (6, 17, 0)>
<12, (16, 1, 0)>
<15, (3, 1, 14)>
<16, (7, 12, 5)>
<17, (5, 10, 0)>
<18, (5, 2, 19)>
<19, (6, 2, 18)>
<0, (17, 18, 14)>
<1, (15, 12, 19)>
<2, (3, 18, 19)>
<14, (9, 0, 15)>
<13, (7, 19, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
