Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 13, 9, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 14, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 10, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 11, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 9, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 9, 11, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 2, 11, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 12

Response:
Let's first identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 10, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 0)>
<13, (12, 11, 3)>
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<6, (1, 14, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 14, 10)>
<0, (5, 10, 3)>
<14, (6, 9, 12)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [11].
