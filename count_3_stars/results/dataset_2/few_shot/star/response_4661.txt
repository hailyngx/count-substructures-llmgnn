Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and check if there are exactly three edges connected to it. If there are, then we have a 3-star with that node as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (8, 1, 9)>
<1, (12, 11, 0)>
<4, (8, 12, 13)>
<8, (14, 4, 0)>
<9, (2, 3, 0)>
<10, (5, 18, 19)>
<15, (6, 17, 16)>
<16, (12, 15, 19)>
<17, (5, 3, 15)>
<18, (6, 10, 17)>
<19, (14, 16, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
