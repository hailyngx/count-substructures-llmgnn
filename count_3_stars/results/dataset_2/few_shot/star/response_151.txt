Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given graph, we can see that the central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 0: <0, (7, 1, 8)>
- For central node 1: <1, (9, 4, 6)>
- For central node 2: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- For central node 3: <3, (5, 7, 1)>
- For central node 4: <4, (7, 1, 2)>
- For central node 5: <5, (9, 6, 3)>
- For central node 6: <6, (5, 7, 1)>
- For central node 7: <7, (5, 4, 8)>
- For central node 8: <8, (9, 7, 2)>
- For central node 9: <9, (5, 8, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, we get a total of [10].
