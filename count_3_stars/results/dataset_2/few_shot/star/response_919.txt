Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.  

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
[<5, (0, 7, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 11, 15)>, <16, (7, 19, 1)>, <1, (9, 16, 10)>]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
