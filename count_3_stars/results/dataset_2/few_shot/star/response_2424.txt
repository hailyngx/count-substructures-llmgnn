Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors, and then check if these neighbors form a 3-star around that node.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are nodes 2, 5, 8, and 6. 

For node 2:
- (2, 4, 9, 3): This does not form a 3-star.
- (2, 4, 9, 5): This does not form a 3-star.
- (2, 4, 3, 5): This does not form a 3-star.

For node 5:
- (5, 3, 2): This forms a 3-star.

For node 8:
- (8, 7, 6, 1): This does not form a 3-star.

For node 6:
- (6, 4, 9, 0): This does not form a 3-star.
- (6, 4, 8, 0): This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, only one 3-star is found in the given graph:

[1]

Unique 3-star found: 
<5, (3, 2)>
