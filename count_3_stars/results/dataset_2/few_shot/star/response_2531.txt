Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- In the provided adjacency list, each node is connected to a few other nodes, forming various 3-stars.
- We will look for nodes with connections to exactly three other nodes, which indicates the presence of a 3-star (center node plus 3 leaf nodes).

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 6, 10)>
<4, (8, 11, 0)>
<4, (9, 11, 10)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (4, 11, 0)>
<4, (10, 5, 0)>
<7, (6, 2, 1)>
<8, (11, 3, 9)>
<10, (5, 3, 9)>
<6, (7, 2, 12)>
<3, (11, 13, 12)>
<11, (8, 14, 0)>
<12, (6, 3, 14)>
<13, (1, 3, 2)>

We have listed all the 3-stars in the graph. Counting them, we find that there are [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
