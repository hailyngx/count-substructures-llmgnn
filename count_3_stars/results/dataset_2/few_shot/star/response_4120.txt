Response:
Based on the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (4, 2, 1)>
<7, (8, 19, 1)>
<7, (2, 17, 13)>
<7, (1, 7, 19)>
<3, (6, 10, 11)>
<3, (17, 2, 18)>
<3, (11, 0, 19)>
<3, (17, 9, 18)>
<1, (5, 7, 13)>
<1, (16, 6, 1)>
<1, (13, 19, 7)>
<1, (16, 18, 0)>
<2, (15, 0, 14)>
<2, (15, 14, 17)>
<0, (15, 9, 11)>
<0, (15, 14, 18)>

By counting the unique 3-stars identified above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
