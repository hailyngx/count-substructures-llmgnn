Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes will be the centers of potential 3-stars.

Let's go through each node and identify if it can act as the center of a 3-star based on its connections:
- Node 0 has 5 edges, Node 1 has 4 edges, Node 2 has 4 edges, Node 3 has 4 edges, Node 4 has 2 edges, Node 5 has 4 edges, Node 6 has 3 edges, Node 7 has 5 edges, Node 8 has 4 edges, and Node 9 has 5 edges.

Nodes 4 and 6 do not have exactly 3 edges, so they cannot act as the center of a 3-star. The remaining nodes have 3 edges and can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Next, let's list the 3-stars according to the nodes acting as the centers:
<0, (9, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 3)>
<9, (7, 6, 0)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
