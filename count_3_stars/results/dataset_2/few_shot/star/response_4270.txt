Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors connected by edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars as it has 5 neighbors.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it has 5 neighbors.
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 4, 7)>
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it has 2 neighbors.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars found: <6, (5, 4, 7)>
