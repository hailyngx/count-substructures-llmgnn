Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 0, 14, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 14, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 3, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 0, 2, 6, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 12, 6, and node 13

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that:
- Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, and 3.
- Node 11 is connected to node 9, 3, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and 8.
- Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to node 8, 0, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and 3.

Therefore, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 11, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<7, (5, 4, X)> [Note: Node 7 only forms a 2-star in this graph]
<8, (5, 4, 10)>
<10, (8, 0, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
