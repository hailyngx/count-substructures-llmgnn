Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and count them. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

Possible 3-stars:
<1, (16, 14, -)>
<2, (18, 8, 5)>
<3, (11, 10, -)>
<4, (12, 10, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 5)>
<6, (8, 7, -)>
<7, (7, 12, 15)>
<8, (0, 13, -)>
<9, (15, 16, 19)>
<10, (4, 12, 6)>
<11, (16, 17, -)>
<12, (10, 18, -)>
<13, (13, 9, 17)>
<14, (1, 16, 19)>
<15, (11, 17, 13)>
<16, (18, 0, 13)>
<17, (17, 16, 13)>
<18, (18, 11, 2)>
<19, (6, 8, 4)>
<20, (15, 7, 12)>

Now we count how many times each unique 3-star appeared in the given graph:
- <2, (18, 8, 5)> appears twice
- <3, (11, 10, -)> appears twice
- <5, (2, 8, 5)> appears twice
- <6, (8, 7, -)> appears twice
- <7, (7, 12, 15)> appears twice
- <9, (15, 16, 19)> appears twice

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
