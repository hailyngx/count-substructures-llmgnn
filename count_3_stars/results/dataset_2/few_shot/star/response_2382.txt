Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 11, 5, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 11, 9, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 9, 14, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 12, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 2, 5, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 2, 13, 5, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 12, 6, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 10, 13, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<12, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (10, 11, 14)>
<13, (0, 6, 14)>
<5, (1, 10, 12)>
<11, (1, 0, 10)>
<10, (2, 11, 14)>
<0, (7, 11, 13)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<14, (5, 10, 13)>
<6, (3, 4, 12)>
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
