Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a star shape). We can start by checking each node and its connections to identify any 3-stars. 

We will begin with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, and 6. 
- This forms a 3-star centered at Node 0 with the leaves being nodes 5, 1, and 3. 
- So, we have found one 3-star: <(0), 1, 3, 5>. 

Next, let's move to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 0, and 8. 
- This also forms a 3-star centered at Node 1 with the leaves being nodes 5, 0, and 8. 
- Another 3-star found: <(1), 0, 5, 8>.

We continue this process for each node until we have identified all 3-stars in the graph. After checking all nodes, the identified 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
