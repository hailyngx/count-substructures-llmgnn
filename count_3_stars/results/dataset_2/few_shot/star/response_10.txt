Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.
To find a 3-star, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges emanating from them, such that 3 of these edges form a triangle. Since we have 20 nodes, we will analyze each node to identify any potential 3-stars.

Analyzing the nodes:
- Node 0 has 1 edge.
- Node 1 has 2 edges.
- Node 2 has 4 edges.
- Node 3 has 1 edge.
- Node 4 has 4 edges: <4, (5, 12, 10)>.
- Node 5 has 2 edges.
- Node 6 has 3 edges: <6, (15, 19, 2)>.
- Node 7 has 3 edges.
- Node 8 has 5 edges.
- Node 9 has 2 edges.
- Node 10 has 5 edges: <10, (9, 2, 4)>.
- Node 11 has 4 edges.
- Node 12 has 5 edges: <12, (2, 4, 10)>.
- Node 13 has 1 edge.
- Node 14 has 1 edge.
- Node 15 has 4 edges.
- Node 16 has 4 edges.
- Node 17 has 4 edges.
- Node 18 has 1 edge.
- Node 19 has 4 edges.

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [2]
Unique 3-stars found: <4, (5, 12, 10)>, <12, (2, 4, 10)>
