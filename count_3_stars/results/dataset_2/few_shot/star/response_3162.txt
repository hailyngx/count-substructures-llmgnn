Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the central nodes that have exactly 3 connected nodes. Then, we check each of their connected nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 

The central nodes in this graph are: Node 1, Node 3, and Node 4. 

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 5, 9, and 7. Hence, a 3-star is formed with Node 1 as the center with nodes 5, 9, and 7 as leaves. 

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to Node 9, 6, and 2. There is no 3-star formed with Node 3 as the center.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to Node 5 and 0. There is no 3-star formed with Node 4 as the center.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

The unique 3-star found:
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
