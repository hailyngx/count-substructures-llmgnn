Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 12, 5)>
<0, (7, 12, 14)>
<0, (7, 5, 14)>
<0, (12, 5, 14)>
<1, (7, 2, 11)>
<1, (7, 11, 13)>
<2, (1, 13, 10)>
<3, (4, 8, 10)>
<3, (4, 10, 13)>
<3, (8, 9, 10)>
<3, (8, 3, 10)>
<4, (8, 9, 14)>
<5, (6, 12, 14)>
<6, (12, 5, 14)>
<6, (12, 6, 13)>
<7, (12, 0, 11)>
<9, (8, 9, 14)>

By counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
