Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 27, 28, and 9
   - Node 1 is connected to node 18, 14, and 29
   - Node 13 is connected to node 22
   - Node 17 is connected to node 18, and 4
   - Node 19 is connected to node 4, and 5
   - Node 22 is connected to node 13, 4, and 10
   - Node 23 is connected to node 9, 3, and 10
   - Node 24 is connected to node 14, and 25
   
2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - <0, (27, 28, 9)>
   - <1, (18, 14, 29)>
   - <22, (13, 4, 10)>
   - <24, (14, 25)>
   - <17, (18, 4)>
   - <19, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
