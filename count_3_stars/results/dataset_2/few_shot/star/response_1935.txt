Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (11, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 14, 12, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 14, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 12, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 2, 4, 12, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 14, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 10, 1, 7, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 9, 11, 3, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 10
Node 12 is connected to node 0, 14, 4, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, 7, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's now list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

[<0, (8, 14, 12)>]
[<1, (6, 9, 4)>]
[<2, (8, 5, 14)>]
[<3, (10, 14, 7)>]
[<4, (6, 12, 5)>]
[<5, (10, 2, 4)>]
[<6, (9, 1, 10)>]
[<7, (9, 8, 14)>]
[<8, (6, 2, 0)>]
[<9, (6, 10, 1)>]
[<10, (9, 11, 3)>]
[<12, (0, 14, 4)>]
[<13, (9, 13, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
