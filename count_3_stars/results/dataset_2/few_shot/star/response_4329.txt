Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 7, 12)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 11)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 14)>
4. <2, (1, 8, 13)>
5. <2, (5, 9, 14)>
6. <3, (1, 5, 14)>
7. <4, (7, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 6, 11)>
10. <9, (4, 7, 12)>
11. <10, (8, 13, 0)>
12. <11, (7, 1, 12)>
13. <12, (13, 0, 11)>
14. <13, (12, 2, 10)>
15. <14, (3, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
