Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to search for such configurations in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (10, 13, 14)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<3, (9, 1, 14)>
<4, (8, 12, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 13)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 14)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<10, (3, 11, 0)>
<11, (1, 10, 14)>
<12, (13, 4)>
<13, (10, 11, 5)>
<14, (3, 11, 0)>

There are a total of [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
