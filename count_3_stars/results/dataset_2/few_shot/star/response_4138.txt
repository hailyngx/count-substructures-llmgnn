Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node's neighbors and find all the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 1: No 3-stars as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 6: <6, (9, 11, 12)>
- For Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 3)>
- For Node 10: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 nodes.
- For Node 11: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 12: No 3-stars as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 13: No 3-stars as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 14: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <6, (9, 11, 12)> and <9, (6, 2, 3)>.
