Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes in the graph which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. 

   Based on the provided adjacency list:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 2.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 1.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 13.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 11.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 5.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 5.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 5.

2. For each of these identified nodes, count the number of unique 3-stars they form.

   - Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (7, 0, 2)>
   - Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (5, 12, 1)>
   - Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (10, 11, 13)>
   - Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (4, 10, 11)>
   - Node 10 forms one 3-star: <10, (6, 13, 5)>
   - Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (6, 2, 3)>
   - Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (10, 8, 5)>
   - Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (7, 10 ,5)>

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

   The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
