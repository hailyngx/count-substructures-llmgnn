Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them, as these nodes can be considered as the centers of potential 3-stars. These nodes are nodes 5, 7, 12, 14, and 18.

Next, we check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star pattern. We will only consider the nodes that are directly connected to these potential central nodes.

Let's go through the potential 3-stars one by one:

1. For node 5:
    - Connected nodes: 9 and 19
    - A 3-star is formed by: <5, (9, 19)>
    
2. For node 7:
    - Connected nodes: 12 and 2
    - A 3-star is formed by: <7, (12, 2)>
    
3. For node 12:
    - Connected nodes: 7, 17, and 15
    - A 3-star is formed by: <12, (7, 17, 15)>
    
4. For node 14:
    - Connected nodes: 4 and 13
    - A 3-star is formed by: <14, (4, 13)>
    
5. For node 18:
    - Connected nodes: 16 and 11
    - A 3-star is formed by: <18, (16, 11)>
    
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
