Response:
Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 13, 6, 7, 3, and 1. 

2. Determine the number of 3-stars with central node 0:
- Node 13, 6, and 7 are not connected to each other, so they do not form a 3-star with central node 0.
- Node 3, 6, and 1 are connected to central node 0, forming a 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 1)>.
  
3. Count the number of 3-stars with central node 0:
- There is 1 unique 3-star with central node 0.

4. Output the final answer:
- The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
  
5. List the unique 3-star found:
- <0, (3, 6, 1)>
