Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. For each node in the graph, we will check all the possible 3-stars.
2. If a node has exactly three neighbors, we will form a 3-star with that node as the center and its neighbors as the leaves.
3. Count the unique 3-stars we find.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 13)>
<1, (10, 18, 16)>
<3, (2, 11, 17)>
<6, (4, 10, 19)>
<10, (7, 14, 16)>
<15, (13, 17, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
