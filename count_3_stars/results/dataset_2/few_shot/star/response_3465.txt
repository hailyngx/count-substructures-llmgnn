Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list for each node, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<2, (3, 16, 14)>
<3, (5, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 12, 6)>
<6, (10, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 15, 8)>
<8, (16, 14, 7)>
<9, (11, 17, 0)>
<10, (1, 18, 15)>
<12, (18, 19, 4)>
<14, (2, 13, 8)>
<16, (2, 18, 19)>
<18, (10, 16, 12)>
<19, (17, 16, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
