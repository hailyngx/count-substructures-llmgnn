Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <2, (8, 6, 7)>
2. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <9, (3, 7, 8)>
5. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
6. <7, (1, 3, 2)>
7. <4, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
