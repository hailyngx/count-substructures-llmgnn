Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, none)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 7, none)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>

After identifying all the 3-stars, we count them to get the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
