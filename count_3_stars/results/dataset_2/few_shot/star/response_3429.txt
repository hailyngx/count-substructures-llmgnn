Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 1, 4)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
