Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows: 
0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10, 11: 11, 12: 12, 13: 13, 14: 14

Now, let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph step by step:

1. For node 0:
   - Find the neighbors of node 0: 4, 7, 13, 10, 11, 12
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 0 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. For node 1:
   - Find the neighbors of node 1: 9, 13, 14, 12
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 1 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

3. For node 2:
   - Find the neighbors of node 2: 9, 7, 5
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 2 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

4. For node 3:
   - Find the neighbors of node 3: 9, 10, 5
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 3 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

5. For node 4:
   - Find the neighbors of node 4: 6, 7, 0, 11
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 4 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

6. For node 5:
   - Find the neighbors of node 5: 13, 11, 2, 3, 14
   - There are two 3-star graphs with node 5 as the center:
     <5, (13, 11, 2)>
     <5, (13, 3, 14)>

7. For node 6:
   - Find the neighbors of node 6: 9, 10, 12, 4
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 6 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

8. For node 7:
   - Find the neighbors of node 7: 9, 4, 0, 2
   - There are no 3-star graphs with node 7 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

9. For node 8:
   - Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

10. For node 9:
    - Find the neighbors of node 9: 6, 2, 3, 1, 7, 12
    - There is one 3-star graph with node 9 as the center:
      <9, (6, 2, 3)>

11. For node 10:
    - Find the neighbors of node 10: 6, 11, 0, 3, 12
    - There are no 3-star graphs with node 10 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

12. For node 11:
    - Find the neighbors of node 11: 4, 10, 0, 5
    - There are no 3-star graphs with node 11 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

13. For node 12:
    - Find the neighbors of node 12: 6, 9, 10, 0, 14, 1
    - There are no 3-star graphs with node 12 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

14. For node 13:
    - Find the neighbors of node 13: 5, 1, 0
    - There are no 3-star graphs with node 13 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

15. For node 14:
    - Find the neighbors of node 14: 5, 1, 12
    - There are no 3-star graphs with node 14 as the center because it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2]. 
The 3-star graphs found are:
<5, (13, 11, 2)>
<5, (13, 3, 14)>
