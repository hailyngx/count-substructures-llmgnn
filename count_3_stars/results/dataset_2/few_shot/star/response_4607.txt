Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (4, 6, 14)>
<1, (16, 18, 21)>
<2, (4, 10, 3)>
<3, (19, 2, 24)>
<4, (0, 29, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 22)>
<6, (5, 8, 10)>
<7, (23, 26, 27)>
<8, (13, 6, 27)>
<9, (5, 11, 27)>
<10, (6, 28, 25)>
<11, (9, 23, 15)>
<12, (28, 19, 20)>
<13, (8, 25, 16)>
<14, (0, 22, 20)>
<15, (26, 11, 16)>
<16, (13, 1, 24)>
<17, (25, 22, 19)>
<18, (21, 1, 0)>
<19, (22, 3, 12)>
<20, (26, 14, 12)>
<21, (28, 18, 29)>
<22, (5, 14, 17)>
<23, (7, 11, 27)>
<24, (16, 3)>
