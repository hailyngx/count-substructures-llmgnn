Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 17.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 15.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 19.
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 1.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 15.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 4 and 14.
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 7 and 14.
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 14, 6, and 13.

2. Create a list of unique 3-stars:
   - <4, (8, 10, 17)>
   - <7, (0, 11, 15)>
   - <14, (17, 11, 19)>
   - <17, (4, 14, 1)>
   - <1, (17, 18, 15)>
   - <10, (4, 14)>
   - <11, (7, 14)>
   - <19, (14, 6, 13)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - [8]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [8]
