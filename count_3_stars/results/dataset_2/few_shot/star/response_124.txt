Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Starting with the center node being connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 4, 8)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (9, 7, 8)>
- <4, (9, 7, 0)>
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- <8, (5, 3, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Now, to find the total number of unique 3-stars, we count the number of patterns listed within <> brackets. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
