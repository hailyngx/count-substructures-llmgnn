Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 9, 3, and 5
   - 3-star with 0 as the center: <0, (4, 9, 5)>
   
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 2, and 8
   - 3-star with 1 as the center: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 1, and 3
   - No 3-star can be formed from node 2 as the center.
   
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 2, 8, 0, and 5
   - 3-star with 3 as the center: <3, (4, 2, 5)>
   
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 0, 1, 6, and 3
   - 3-star with 4 as the center: <4, (7, 1, 6)>
   
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 0, and 3
   - No 3-star can be formed from node 5 as the center.
   
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 9, 1, and 8
   - No 3-star can be formed from node 6 as the center.
   
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, and 9
   - No 3-star can be formed from node 7 as the center.
   
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, and 1
   - No 3-star can be formed from node 8 as the center.
   
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 7, 6, 8, 1, and 0
    - No 3-star can be formed from node 9 as the center.
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
