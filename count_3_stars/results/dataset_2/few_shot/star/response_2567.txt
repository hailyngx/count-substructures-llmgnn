Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star structures. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (5, 4, 7)>
- <1, (9, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 9, 4)>
- <3, (9, 8, 0)>
- <4, (8, 0, 2)>
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- <6, (5, 9, 2)>
- <7, (0, 1)>
- <8, (4, 6, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 2)>

After identifying the unique 3-stars in the graph, we count them to determine the total number of 3-stars. Finally, we put the count in brackets:
