Response:
The first step is to identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Based on the given graph, we can see that the central nodes have exactly three neighbors. Let's find the central nodes:

Central Nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (26, 18, 23)>
<6, (14, 11, 23)>
<8, (15, 5, 7)>
<11, (7, 3, 6)>
<13, (29, 1, 19)>
<14, (6, 1, 25)>
<16, (15, 3, 27)>
<20, (26, 21, 3)>
<23, (17, 2, 4)>
<25, (14, 7, 10)>
<26, (9, 1, 15)>
<27, (7, 10, 16)>

Count of 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
