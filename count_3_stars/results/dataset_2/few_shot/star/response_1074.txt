Response:
The 3-star graph is a structure where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We need to count the number of such 3-star structures in the given graph. 

To determine this, we can look at each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star. If a node has exactly three neighbors and those neighbors are not connected to each other, then we have found a 3-star with that node as the center. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
- <0, (20, 17, 5)>
- <1, (7, 18, 2)>
- <3, (9, 29, 14)>
- <4, (7, 28, 21)>
- <6, (5, 24, 17)>
- <12, (25, 28, 14)>
- <13, (22, 21, 2)>
- <15, (5, 24, 15)>
- <19, (24, 1, 19)>
- <20, (11, 29, 26)>
- <23, (20, 26, 14)>
- <25, (22, 27, 12)>
- <27, (24, 25, 28)>
- <29, (20, 8, 3)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [14]
