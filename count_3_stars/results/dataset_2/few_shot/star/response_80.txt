Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we identify each possible 3-star configuration by checking for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the 3-stars:
    - Node 6: (6, 9, 5, 7) <6, (9, 5, 7)>
    - Node 9: (9, 6, 8, 11) <9, (6, 8, 11)>
    - Node 5: (5, 6, 1, 11) <5, (6, 1, 11)>
    - Node 7: (7, 6, 4) <7, (6, 4)>
    - Node 8: (8, 9, 3, 5) <8, (9, 3, 5)>
    - Node 11: (11, 9, 1, 5) <11, (9, 1, 5)>
    - Node 4: (4, 11, 7, 12) <4, (11, 7, 12)>
    - Node 12: (12, 3, 10, 11) <12, (3, 10, 11)>
    - Node 0: (0, 4, 8, 14) <0, (4, 8, 14)>
    - Node 14: (14, 10, 4, 0) <14, (10, 4, 0)>
    - Node 3: (3, 1, 8, 12) <3, (1, 8, 12)>
    - Node 1: (1, 3, 5, 11) <1, (3, 5, 11)>
    - Node 2: (2, 0, 13, 14) <2, (0, 13, 14)>
    - Node 13: (13, 6, 9, 7) <13, (6, 9, 7)>
    - Node 10: (10, 6, 12, 14) <10, (6, 12, 14)>

2. Count the unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (9, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 8, 11)>
    - <5, (6, 1, 11)>
    - <7, (6, 4)>
    - <8, (9, 3, 5)>
    - <11, (9, 1, 5)>
    - <4, (11, 7, 12)>
    - <12, (3, 10, 11)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 14)>
    - <14, (10, 4, 0)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 12)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 11)>
    - <2, (0, 13, 14)>
    - <13, (6, 9, 7)>
    - <10, (6, 12, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
