Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<0, (1, 7, 14)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 13, 4)>
<1, (0, 13, 9)>
<2, (3, 11, 13)>
<2, (3, 13, 14)>
<2, (11, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 13, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 14)>
<6, (4, 8, 12)>
<6, (5, 8, 10)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 12)>
<9, (7, 13, 14)>
<10, (0, 6, 12)>
<11, (2, 10, 13)>
<12, (6, 10, 11)>

Since we have listed all the 3-stars present in the graph, we can now count them: [20]
