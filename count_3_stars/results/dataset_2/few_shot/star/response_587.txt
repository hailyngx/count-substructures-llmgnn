Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph and then count the total number of unique 3-stars.

<12, (2, 17, 28)>
<16, (9, 19, 25)>
<17, (1, 5, 12)>
<19, (9, 15, 16)>
<21, (10, 22, 26)>
<22, (4, 6, 7)>
<27, (14, 29, 9)>
<28, (5, 12, 16)>

After listing the unique 3-stars, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
