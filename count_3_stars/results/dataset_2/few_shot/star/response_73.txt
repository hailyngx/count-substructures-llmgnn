Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-star structures in the graph:

<0, (20, 16, 15)>
<1, (21, 17, 19)>
<2, (29, 23, 17)>
<3, (28, 2, 23)>
<4, (7, 24, 10)>
<5, (7, 13, 27)>
<6, (24, 28, 12)>
<7, (21, 4, 15)>
<8, (20, 27, 8)>
<9, (27, 17, 9)>
<11, (14, 18, 11)>
<13, (23, 5, 13)>
<14, (25, 16, 13)>
<15, (21, 29, 0)>
<17, (1, 27, 2)>
<18, (28, 19, 12)>
<19, (21, 29, 18)>
<20, (0, 28, 8)>
<21, (1, 19, 15)>
<22, (25, 26, 28)>

By counting the number of unique 3-star structures, we find there are [20] such 3-star structures in the given graph.
