Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 6: <1, (9, 4, 6)>
2. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 0: <6, (5, 7, 0)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 7: <8, (9, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
