Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list and given edges, we can find the 3-star graphs:
1. From the adjacency list:
   - Node 1: (10, 11, 7), (11, 12, 1)
   - Node 2: (12, 0, 9), (5, 8, 6)
   - Node 3: (0, 6, 14), (9, 12, 3)
   - Node 4: (13, 14, 4)
   - Node 6: (10, 11, 6), (6, 5, 3)
   - Node 9: (7, 12, 9), (9, 0, 2)
   - Node 10: (1, 11, 10), (10, 8, 6)
   - Node 11: (10, 1, 11), (11, 6, 12)
   - Node 12: (11, 7, 12), (12, 1, 9)
   - Node 13: (1, 4, 13), (14, 12, 13)
   - Node 14: (12, 3, 14), (13, 4, 14)

2. From the given edges:
   - (10, 11, 1)
   - (10, 6, 11)
   - (10, 8, 1)
   - (11, 10, 6)
   - (11, 6, 12)
   - (7, 12, 1)
   - (9, 12, 7)
   - (9, 0, 2)
   - (5, 8, 6)
   - (0, 6, 14)
   - (0, 9, 3)
   - (3, 14, 0)
   - (13, 14, 4)
   - (1, 4, 13)

Hence, the unique 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<1, (10, 11, 7)>
<2, (12, 0, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 14)>
<4, (13, 14, 4)>
<5, (10, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<7, (7, 12, 9)>
<8, (10, 11, 1)>
<9, (11, 6, 12)>
<10, (1, 11, 10)>
<11, (12, 1, 9)>
<12, (1, 4, 13)>
<13, (11, 10, 6)>
<14, (9, 0, 2)>
<15, (10, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
