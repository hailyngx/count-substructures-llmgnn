Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is the center in a 3-star. We can do this by checking for each node, how many sets of three neighbors (i.e., 3-stars) are connected to it.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 1)>
<3, (6, 0, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (7, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
