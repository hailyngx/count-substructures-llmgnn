Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12)

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list down the unique 3-stars first:

<4, (2, 0, 1)>
<7, (11, 14, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (14, 8, 6)>
<10, (13, 5, 8)>
<11, (5, 8, 4)>
<12, (14, 7, 11)>
<13, (10, 5, 3)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above:
