Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star structure around it. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 1, and a (3-star structure)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 12, 11, and 10 (3-star structure)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 11, and a (3-star structure)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
- <4, (7, 1, x)>
- <5, (12, 11, 10)>
- <8, (2, 11, x)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
