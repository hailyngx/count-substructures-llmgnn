Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (10, 3, 8)>
- <1, (9, 7, 14)>
- <2, (7, 12, 8)>
- <3, (9, 0, 13)>
- <4, (15, 14, 19)>
- <5, (10)>
- <6, (13)>
- <7, (12, 2, 1)>
- <8, (11, 0, 2)>
- <9, (3, 1, 19)>
- <10, (5, 0, 18)>
- <11, (18, 8, 17)>
- <12, (16, 7, 2)>
- <13, (16, 6, 18)>
- <14, (18, 1, 15)>
- <15, (14, 4)>
- <16, (12, 13)>
- <17, (11, 12, 1)>
- <18, (11, 14, 19)>
- <19, (9, 2, 18)>

There are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
