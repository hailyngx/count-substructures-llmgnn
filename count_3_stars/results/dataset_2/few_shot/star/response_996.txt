Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's analyze the graph and find the 3-star configurations:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 13: <0, (7, 12, 13)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 14: <1, (9, 2, 14)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 1: <2, (9, 12, 1)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 14: <3, (9, 11, 14)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 13, and 11: <4, (7, 13, 11)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 14: <5, (9, 13, 14)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 10: <6, (2, 11, 10)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 13: <7, (9, 4, 13)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 3: <9, (5, 2, 3)>
10. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 1: <10, (3, 0, 1)>
11. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 3: <11, (4, 12, 3)>

There are a total of 11 unique 3-star configurations in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
