Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node (the center) and the three nodes connected to it for each 3-star configuration.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. For node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
2. For node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
3. For node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
4. For node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
5. For node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
6. For node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
7. For node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
8. For node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
9. For node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
10. For node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
11. For node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
12. For node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
13. For node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
14. For node 13: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
15. For node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
