Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

### Step 1:
Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: (13, 14, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 13, ???)
- Node 2: (10, 7, ???)

### Step 2:
Identify the missing connections for nodes with incomplete lists:
- For Node 4, the missing connection is Node 0 since it connects to 1 and 13.
- For Node 2, the missing connection is Node 10 since it connects to 7.

### Step 3:
Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (13, 14, 7)>
- <4, (1, 13, 0)>
- <2, (10, 7, 2)>

### Final Answer:
[3]

### Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (13, 14, 7)>
- <4, (1, 13, 0)>
- <2, (10, 7, 2)>
