Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first look at the adjacency list and determine the 3-star configurations. 

The 3-star configurations in the graph are as follows:
<0, (17, 2, 5)>
<1, (11, 6, 3)>
<2, (8, 12, 15)>
<3, (1, 10, 5)>
<4, (9)>
<5, (16, 3, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (11, 6, 0)>
<8, (3, 10, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 15)>
<10, (3, 15, 8)>
<11, (7, 1, 13)>
<12, (17, 6, 8)>
<13, (11)>
<14, (18, 19)>
<15, (9, 10, 2)>
<16, (5)>
<17, (0, 12, 18)>
<18, (14, 17, 3)>
<19, (14)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
