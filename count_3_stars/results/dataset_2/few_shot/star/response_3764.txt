Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes, and we need to find the number of 3-stars present in it. 

To find the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that connect exactly three other nodes. The nodes that fulfill this condition would be the center nodes of the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 25
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 1, and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 19, 29, and 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 23, 14, and 12
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 16, and 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 29, and 12
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 10, and 18
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 20
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 27, 17, and 18
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 27, 22, and 24
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 8, 3, and 13
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 21
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and 21
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 21, and 18
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 11

To count the unique 3-stars, we will examine each of these nodes as the center node and identify the other connected nodes as leaves. Let's find all the 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
<1, (2, 6, 4)>
<8, (23, 14, 12)>
<15, (27, 10, 18)>
<18, (15, 27, 20)>
<21, (27, 22, 24)>
<14, (8, 29, 12)>
