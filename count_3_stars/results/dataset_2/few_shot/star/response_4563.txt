Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 13, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 12, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 10, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 10, 6, 2, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 13, 5, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 14, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 13, 9, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 13, 10, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 13, 9, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 7
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 10, 9, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, 6, and node 9

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

The central nodes in the 3-stars can be nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, and 14 as they are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 9, 10)>
<5, (4, 6, 10)>
<6, (4, 13, 14)>
<7, (4, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 8, 10)>
<13, (6, 7, 10)>
<14, (1, 5, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars that we found, we get [7].
