Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Look for all nodes that have at least 3 edges. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
   - Nodes 3, 5, and 8 have at least 3 edges.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - We find that only node 3 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 5, 9, 6. So, node 3 can be the center of a 3-star.

3. For node 3 as the center, identify the connected nodes that form the leaves of the star.
   - The connected nodes to node 3 are 5, 9, 6. So, the 3-star centered at node 3 has leaves 5, 9, 6.

Therefore, there is one unique 3-star in the given graph: <3, (5, 9, 6)>.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
