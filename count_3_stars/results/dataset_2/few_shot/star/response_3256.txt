Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Nodes 5, 4, and 2 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be considered as potential centers of 3-stars.

2. For each potential center node, check the connected nodes and see if they form a 3-star:
   - For node 5: (5, 9, 6, 2), (5, 9, 8, 4) are 3-stars.
   - For node 4: (4, 5, 3, 7), (4, 5, 2, 0) are 3-stars.
   - For node 2: (2, 5, 9, 4), (2, 5, 7, 1) are 3-stars.

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
