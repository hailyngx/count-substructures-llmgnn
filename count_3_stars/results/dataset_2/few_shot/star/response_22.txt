Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Specifically, we are looking for instances where a node is connected to three other nodes, which are not directly connected to each other. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (6, 7, 3)>
2. <1, (7, 8, 0)>
3. <2, (5, 4, 3)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 2)>
6. <5, (6, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (5, 9, 3)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 3)>
9. <8, (9, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
