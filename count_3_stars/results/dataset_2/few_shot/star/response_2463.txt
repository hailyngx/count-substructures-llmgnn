Response:
There are three-star configurations in the given graph. Let's find and count them step by step.

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 12.
   <1, (3, 11, 12)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 7.
   <3, (1, 7, 21)>

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   <6, (0, 2, 4)>

4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 25, 2, and 29.
   <8, (25, 2, 29)>

5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 27, and 23.
   <10, (11, 23, 27)>

6. Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 25, 28, and 16.
   <12, (1, 25, 28)>, <12, (1, 16, 25)>

7. Node 16 is connected to nodes 26, 17, and 12.
   <16, (26, 17, 12)>

8. Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 23, 5, and 13.
   <18, (9, 5, 23)>, <18, (9, 13, 23)>

9. Node 20 is connected to nodes 25, 0, 29, and 24.
   <20, (25, 0, 24)>, <20, (25, 29, 24)>

10. Node 21 is connected to nodes 26, 3, and 27.
    <21, (26, 3, 27)>

11. Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 19, 8, and 24.
    <25, (20, 8, 24)>, <25, (20, 19, 24)>

12. Node 26 is connected to nodes 21, 11, and 16.
    <26, (21, 11, 16)>

13. Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 21, 22, and 19.
    <27, (10, 22, 19)>, <27, (10, 21, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [13].
