Node 13 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 8, 13, 12, and node 10

Response:
Step 1: 
Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
In this graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 7 is connected to node 6, 10, and 14
- Node 2 is connected to node 8, 11, and 12
- Node 3 is connected to node 8, 10, and 12

Step 2:
For each identified center node, find the three nodes that are connected to it. These three nodes will form a 3-star with the center node.
- For Node 7: (6, 10, 14) 
- For Node 2: (8, 11, 12)
- For Node 3: (8, 10, 12)

Step 3:
List the unique 3-stars found:
<7, (6, 10, 14)>, <2, (8, 11, 12)>, <3, (8, 10, 12)>

Step 4:
Count the number of unique 3-stars:
