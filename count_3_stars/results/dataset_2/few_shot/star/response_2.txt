Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (1, 11, 0)>
<4, (9, 12, 0)>
<6, (9, 14, 11)>
<7, (9, 1, 10)>
<8, (3, 14, 12)>
<10, (3, 11, 7)>
<12, (1, 11, 4)>
<13, (6, 3, 5)>
<14, (6, 10, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
