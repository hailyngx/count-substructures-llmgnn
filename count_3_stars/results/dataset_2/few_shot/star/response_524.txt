Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Starting from each node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
1. Node 0: No 3-star.
2. Node 1: 1 forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 19).
3. Node 2: No 3-star.
4. Node 3: 3 forms a 3-star with (1, 2, 9).
5. Node 4: 4 forms a 3-star with (19, 10, 6).
6. Node 5: No 3-star.
7. Node 6: 6 forms two 3-stars with (4, 1, 13) and (17, 19, 7).
8. Node 7: No 3-star.
9. Node 8: No 3-star.
10. Node 9: 9 forms two 3-stars with (1, 3, 18) and (11, 14, 19).
11. Node 10: 10 forms a 3-star with (4, 18, 15).
12. Node 11: No 3-star.
13. Node 12: No 3-star.
14. Node 13: No 3-star.
15. Node 14: No 3-star.
16. Node 15: No 3-star.
17. Node 16: No 3-star.
18. Node 17: No 3-star.
19. Node 18: No 3-star.
20. Node 19: No 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 19)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (19, 10, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 13)>
<6, (17, 19, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 18)>
<9, (11, 14, 19)>
<10, (4, 18, 15)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
