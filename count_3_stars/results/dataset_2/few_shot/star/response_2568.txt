Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 3: <0, (6, 7, 3)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 8: <1, (5, 9, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 2: <3, (6, 4, 2)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 0: <7, (9, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
