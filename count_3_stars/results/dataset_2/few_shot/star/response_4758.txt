Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which would form a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

From the adjacency list given:
1. Node 0 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 4. <1, (9, 6, 4)>
3. Node 2 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 8. <4, (9, 7, 8)>
6. Node 5 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8. <6, (9, 1, 8)>
8. Node 7 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 4. <8, (5, 6, 4)>
10. Node 9 does not have 3 connections, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (9, 6, 4)> and <8, (5, 6, 4)>.

Finally, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
