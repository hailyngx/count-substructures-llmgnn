Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the center node and its associated leaves:
   - Center node 0: Leaves {9, 14, 10, 12}
   - Center node 1: Leaves {13, 4}
   - Center node 2: Leaves {8, 18}
   - Center node 3: Leaves {6, 18}
   - Center node 4: Leaves {5, 1, 16}
   - Center node 5: Leaves {9, 18, 4}
   - Center node 6: Leaves {3, 12}
   - Center node 7: Leaves {9, 14, 11}
   - Center node 8: Leaves {13, 2, 19, 16, 11}
   - Center node 9: Leaves {5, 0, 7, 12}
   - Center node 10: Leaves {11, 15, 0}
   - Center node 11: Leaves {8, 10, 7}
   - Center node 12: Leaves {9, 14, 0, 6}
   - Center node 13: Leaves {1, 8, 19}
   - Center node 14: Leaves {17, 0, 7, 12}
   - Center node 15: Leaves {10, 18}
   - Center node 16: Leaves {17, 8, 4}
   - Center node 17: Leaves {14, 16}
   - Center node 18: Leaves {5, 3, 2, 15}
   - Center node 19: Leaves {8, 13}

2. Count the number of 3-stars based on the identified center and leaves combinations:
   - Number of 3-stars: 5
   
3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (9, 14, 10)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 16)>
   - <8, (13, 19, 16)>
   - <11, (8, 10, 7)>
   - <12, (9, 14, 0)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
