Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 10, 3, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 12, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 10, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 12, 1, 0, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 10, 14, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 10, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, 8, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 10, and node 11

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the graph. 
For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must have exactly three neighbors.

Nodes 5, 4, 7, and 10 have 5 neighbors each. These nodes cannot be centers of 3-stars.

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 have 4 neighbors each. These nodes cannot be centers of 3-stars.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [0].
