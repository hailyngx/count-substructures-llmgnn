Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 0: {23, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {17, 26, 15, 13}
- Node 2: {10, 18, 16}
- Node 3: {11, 19}
- Node 4: {17, 28, 0}
- Node 5: {18, 22, 29}
- Node 6: {16, 0}
- Node 7: {26}
- Node 8: {21, 29}
- Node 9: {16, 21}
- Node 10: {21, 2}
- Node 11: {25, 3, 23, 29}
- Node 12: {13}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 29}
- Node 14: {25, 24}
- Node 15: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 16: {2, 28, 9, 27, 6}
- Node 17: {20, 1, 28, 4}
- Node 18: {2, 5}
- Node 19: {3, 15}
- Node 20: {25, 17, 24}
- Node 21: {10, 9, 27, 8}
- Node 22: {23, 5, 24}
- Node 23: {11, 22, 0}
- Node 24: {20, 22, 28, 14}
- Node 25: {20, 26, 14, 11}
- Node 26: {25, 1, 7}
- Node 27: {16, 28, 21}
- Node 28: {17, 16, 27, 4, 24}
- Node 29: {11, 15, 13, 5, 8}

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
From the given adjacency list, we identify the 3-stars based on their structure where the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (25, 29, 3)>
<15, (29, 1, 19)>
<17, (1, 28, 4)>
<21, (8, 29, 9)>
<25, (20, 14, 11)>
<28, (16, 27, 4)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
