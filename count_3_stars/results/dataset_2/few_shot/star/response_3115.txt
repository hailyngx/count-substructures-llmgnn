Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 10)>
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<3, (4, 5, 12)>
<4, (3, 11, 14)>
<5, (1, 3, 13)>
<6, (0, 10, 12)>
<7, (2, 8, 10)>
<8, (2, 5, 13)>
<11, (4, 10, 13)>
<12, (1, 2, 6)>
<13, (5, 8, 11)>
<14, (4, 11, 12)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
