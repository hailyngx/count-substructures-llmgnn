Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 14, 2, 8, 13, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 14, 8, 11, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 12, 10, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 12, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 3, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 11, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 7, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 6, 11, 4, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's look for all the 3-stars:

1. <5, (9, 12, 13)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 11)>
3. <8, (9, 0, 1)>
4. <13, (5, 2, 1)>
5. <3, (14, 8, 11)>
6. <11, (9, 6, 7)>
7. <12, (5, 6, 10)>
8. <0, (6, 8, 13)>
9. <14, (3, 1)>
10. <2, (1, 13, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
