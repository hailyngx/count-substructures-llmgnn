Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the provided edges and adjacency list.

Upon analyzing the graph, we find that the following 3-stars exist:
<0, (7, 16, 17)>
<1, (18, 9, 8)>
<2, (13, 8, 19)>
<3, (4, 10, No 3-star)>
<4, (9, 10, 17)>
<5, (18, 6, 10)>
<6, (13, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<7, (16, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<8, (16, 2, 11)>
<9, (1, 16, 14)>
<10, (19, 5, 4)>
<11, (8, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<12, (18, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<13, (18, 2, 6)>
<14, (9, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<15, (0, No 3-star, No 3-star)>
<16, (7, 2, 9)>
<17, (4, 19, No 3-star)>
<18, (13, 12, 5)>
<19, (18, 10, 17)>

So, based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
