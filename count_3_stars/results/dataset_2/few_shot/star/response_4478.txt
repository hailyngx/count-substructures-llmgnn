Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in this graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 3, 15, 18, 19, and 25 are connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 1, 4, 6, 12, and 14 are connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 2, 5, 7, 9, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29 are connected to more than 3 other nodes. 
- Node 0, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 16 are connected to 4 other nodes.

Therefore, the potential central nodes are: Node 1, 4, 6, 12, and 14.

Let's check each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star:
- For node 1: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) forms a 3-star with node 1 as the central node.
- For node 4: (4, 18) (4, 19) forms a 3-star with node 4 as the central node.
- For node 6: (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) forms a 3-star with node 6 as the central node.
- For node 12: (12, 10) (12, 8) forms a 3-star with node 12 as the central node.
- For node 14: (14, 25) does not form a 3-star as it's only connected to one node.

Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
<<1, (17, 2, 10)>, <4, (18, 19, 27)>, <6, (5, 19, 13)>, <12, (10, 8)>>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
