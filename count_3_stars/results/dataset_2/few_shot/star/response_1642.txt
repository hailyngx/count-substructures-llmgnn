Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. Then we will count them to find the total number of 3-stars.

The possible 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<3, (15, 7, 17)>
<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 18, 11)>
<3, (17, 14, 10)>
<3, (5, 12, 2)>
<3, (8, 4, 19)>
<15, (1, 9, 11)>
<14, (17, 10, 16)>
<6, (12, 19, 0)>
<4, (8, 13, 16)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [9].
