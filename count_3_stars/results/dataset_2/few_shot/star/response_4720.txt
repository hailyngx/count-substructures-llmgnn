Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 14, 2)>
<1, (27, 14, 6)>
<2, (0, 12, 20)>
<3, (15, 6, 4)>
<5, (26, 8, 16)>
<6, (3, 7, 1)>
<9, (25, 19, 16)>
<10, (26, 12, 13)>
<11, (15, 28, 8)>
<13, (15, 17, 20)>
<14, (0, 7, 1)>
<15, (26, 3, 13)>
<16, (9, 23, 5)>
<18, (26, 19, 17)>
<19, (14, 18, 25)>
<20, (13, 6, 2)>
<21, (23, 25, 24)>
<22, (7, 24, 22)>
<26, (18, 5, 10)>
<27, (0, 1, -)>
<28, (11, -, -)>
<29, (12, 11, 18)>

There are a total of 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the output is [21].
