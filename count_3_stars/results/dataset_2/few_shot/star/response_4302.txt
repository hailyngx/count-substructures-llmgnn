Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., form a 3-star pattern). 

Here, let's analyze the graph step by step to find all unique 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 9, 4, 12)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 14, 13)
3. Node 2: (2, 9, 7, 10), (2, 7, 11, 8), (2, 10, 14, 1)
4. Node 3: None
5. Node 4: (4, 5, 7, 0), (4, 7, 11, 3), (4, 6, 12, 5)
6. Node 5: (5, 9, 6, 12), (5, 6, 4, 7), (5, 12, 0, 6)
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 4, 7), (6, 4, 7, 12)
8. Node 7: (7, 5, 4, 6), (7, 4, 6, 2), (7, 2, 13, 10)
9. Node 8: None
10. Node 9: (9, 5, 2, 0)
11. Node 10: (10, 11, 13, 2), (10, 13, 1, 14)
12. Node 11: (11, 5, 4, 10)
13. Node 12: (12, 5, 6, 0)
14. Node 13: (13, 7, 10, 1), (13, 10, 14, 1)
15. Node 14: (14, 10, 8, 3), (14, 8, 1, 13)

Hence, there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (9, 4, 12)>, <1, (2, 14, 13)>, <2, (9, 7, 10)>, <2, (7, 11, 8)>, <2, (10, 14, 1)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (7, 11, 3)>, <4, (6, 12, 5)>, <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (12, 0, 6)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 12)>, <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (2, 13, 10)>, <10, (11, 13, 2)>, <10, (13, 1, 14)>, <13, (7, 10, 1)>, <13, (10, 14, 1)>
