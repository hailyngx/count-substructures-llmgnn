Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <0, (6, 13, 15)>
2. <1, (8, 15, 18)>
3. <2, (9, 3, 0)>
4. <3, (9, 8, 7)>
5. <4, (9, 15, 19)>
6. <5, (11, 8, 18)>
7. <6, (11, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (3, 10, 0)>
9. <8, (16, 5, 1)>
10. <9, (6, 4, 3)>
11. <10, (13, 7, 15)>
12. <11, (16, 5, 18)>
13. <12, (17, 14, 12)>
14. <13, (10, 0, 13)>
15. <14, (17, 12, 14)>
16. <15, (1, 10, 0)>
17. <16, (11, 17, 8)>
18. <17, (16, 12, 17)>
19. <18, (11, 16, 5)>
20. <19, (4, 15, 19)>

There are a total of 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
