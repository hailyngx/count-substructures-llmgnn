Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 0) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 13, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 14, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 11, 14, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 11, 14, 10, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 12, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 13, 4, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 13, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 14, 7, 5, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 9, 6, 11, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 11, 1, 10, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 7, 12, 2, and node 5

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Nodes 0, 4, 2, and 10 are examples of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if they form a 3-star configuration.
- For Node 0: (0, 8, 1, 3), (0, 8, 1, 4)
- For Node 4: (4, 13, 9, 0), (4, 13, 9, 10)
- For Node 2: (2, 14, 7, 5)
- For Node 10: (10, 13, 7, 9)

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<0, (8, 1, 3)>
<0, (8, 1, 4)>
<4, (13, 9, 0)>
<4, (13, 9, 10)>
<2, (14, 7, 5)>
<10, (13, 7, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
The number of unique 3-stars = 6
