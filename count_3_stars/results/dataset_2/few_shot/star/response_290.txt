Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
