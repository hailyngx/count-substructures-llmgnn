Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 11, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 12, 0, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 2, 1, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 11, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 11, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 4, 11, 12, 13, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 1, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 5, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 9, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 2, and 10.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and 14.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 10.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 11.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 1.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 6.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 1.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and 0.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 1.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 12, and 14.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.

So, the final answer is: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (13, 2, 10)>
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<4, (9, 7, 10)>
<10, (5, 4, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 1)>
<1, (5, 11, 6)>
<6, (11, 8, 1)>
<8, (4, 11, 0)>
<0, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (8, 12, 14)>
