Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: (15, 22, 23)
- Node 1: (25, 14, 4)
- Node 2: (3, 22, 17, 11, 4)
- Node 3: (15, 20, 2)
- Node 4: (2, 1, 25)
- Node 5: (21, 8, 19)
- Node 6: (15, 28, 11)
- Node 7: (15, 21, 26)
- Node 8: (5, 20, 18)
- Node 9: (28, 10, 18)
- Node 10: (27, 21, 9, 25)
- Node 11: (6, 2, 12)
- Node 12: (13, 17, 11)
- Node 13: (12, 19)
- Node 14: (24, 1)
- Node 15: (3, 7, 0, 6)
- Node 16: (19)
- Node 17: (22, 12, 2)
- Node 18: (8, 9)
- Node 19: (5, 13, 25, 24, 16)
- Node 20: (3, 8)
- Node 21: (7, 10, 5, 29)
- Node 22: (0, 23, 2, 24, 17)
- Node 23: (0, 22)
- Node 24: (22, 19, 14)
- Node 25: (28, 19, 10, 1, 4)
- Node 26: (7, 29)
- Node 27: (10)
- Node 28: (6, 9, 25)
- Node 29: (21, 26)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 7, 0) 
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors (15, 21, 26) 
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors (7, 10, 5) 
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 23, 2) 

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<15, (3, 7, 0)>
<7, (15, 21, 26)>
<21, (7, 10, 5)>
<22, (0, 23, 2)>
