Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <14, (17, 7, 1)>
2. <17, (14, 16, 15)>
3. <1, (14, 3, 2)>
4. <3, (1, 13, 9)>
5. <10, (11, 9, 12)>
6. <11, (10)>
7. <2, (1, 5, 0)>
8. <5, (2, 18, 6)>
9. <18, (19, 15, 5)>
10. <6, (5, 16)>
11. <7, (14, 12, 16)>
12. <9, (3, 10, 12)>
13. <13, (3, 4, 16)>
14. <0, (2, 5, 4)>
15. <16, (17, 6, 7)>
16. <19, (3, 18, 15)>
17. <8>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
