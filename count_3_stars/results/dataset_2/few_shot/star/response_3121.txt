Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the pattern of a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 10, 3, 1.
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 14, 12.
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 10, 0, 5.
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 8, 14, 1.
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 12.
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 9.
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 7, 13.
   - Node 11: Connected to nodes 4, 10, 13.
   - Node 14: Connected to nodes 4, 2, 5.

2. For each of the identified nodes, check if the neighbors form a 3-star configuration:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (10, 3, 1)>
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 14, 12)>
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (4, 10, 13)>
   - Node 14 does not form a 3-star.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (10, 3, 1)>, <2, (6, 14, 12)>, <11, (4, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
