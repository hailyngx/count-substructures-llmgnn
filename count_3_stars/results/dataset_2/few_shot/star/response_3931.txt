Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2)

Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Following the given information, we see that the central node has exactly 3 outgoing edges. Therefore, to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the nodes connected to them, forming the 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with the leaves (5, 9, 4) <0, (5, 9, 4)>
2. Node 1 forms two 3-stars:
   - With leaves (5, 9, 8) <1, (5, 9, 8)>
   - With leaves (2, 8, 5) <1, (2, 8, 5)>
3. Node 2 forms two 3-stars:
   - With leaves (4, 6, 1) <2, (4, 6, 1)>
   - With leaves (8, 7, 5) <2, (8, 7, 5)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves (9, 6, 7) <3, (9, 6, 7)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 6, 0) <4, (2, 6, 0)>
6. Node 5 forms two 3-stars:
   - With leaves (1, 0, 7) <5, (1, 0, 7)>
   - With leaves (6, 7, 0) <5, (6, 7, 0)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 7, 3) <6, (2, 7, 3)>
8. Node 7 forms two 3-stars:
   - With leaves (5, 8, 3) <7, (5, 8, 3)>
   - With leaves (9, 6, 0) <7, (9, 6, 0)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 7, 2) <8, (1, 7, 2)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (3, 1, 7) <9, (3, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10] and they are <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 5)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>, <2, (8, 7, 5)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 0)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <6, (2, 7, 3)>, <7, (5, 8, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>.
