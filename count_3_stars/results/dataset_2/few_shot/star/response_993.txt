Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph.

Starting with the central nodes, we can see that the central nodes have 3 neighbors each, forming potential 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (8, 11, 15)>
<5, (2, 7, 10)>
<8, (3, 6, 10)>
<10, (5, 6, 11)>
<11, (3, 10, 15)>
<13, (2, 7, 9)>
<14, (5, 8, 18)>
<15, (3, 4, 11)>
<16, (0, 12, 19)>
<18, (4, 7, 14)>
<19, (0, 8, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
