Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (12, 5, 3)>
<1, (8, 5, 13)>
<2, (7, 3, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<4, (7, 12, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (13, 1, 10)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (14, 1, 5)>
<9, (13, 2, 14)>
<10, (7, 13, 1)>
<11, (7, 0, 12)>
<12, (4, 7, 14)>
<13, (1, 10, 9)>
<14, (8, 2, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [14]
