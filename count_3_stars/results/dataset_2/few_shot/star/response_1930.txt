26. Node 25: (25, 14, 17, 20), (25, 22, 16, 12), (25, 3, 24, 1)
27. Node 26: No 3-star centered at node 26
28. Node 27: (27, 7, 15, 11), (27, 18, 13, 1)
29. Node 28: (28, 21, 18, 13), (28, 26, 20, 8)
30. Node 29: (29, 14, 25, 22), (29, 23, 8, 20), (29, 11, 15, 6), (29, 18, 21, 28)

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of 43 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the final answer is [43].
