Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
