Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. To be a part of a 3-star, a node needs to have exactly three edges connected to it.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 12 

Next, let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<12, (0, 1, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars formed by the identified nodes:
[4]
