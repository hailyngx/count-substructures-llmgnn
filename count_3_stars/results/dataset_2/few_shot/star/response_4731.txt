Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph. A center node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes:

From the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes. This can be a center.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes. This can be a center.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes. This can be a center.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes. 
- Node 9 is connected to 5 nodes.

Potential center nodes are: 2, 3, and 5 because they are each connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Next, let's examine the connections of these potential center nodes to find the 3-star structures:
- Node 2: (2, 9, 1, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 7, 0, 1)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 7, 8)

Hence, the 3-stars are:
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (7, 0, 1)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
