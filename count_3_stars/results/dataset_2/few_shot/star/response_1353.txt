Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph.

To identify a 3-star configuration, we need to look for nodes that are connected in the form of a central node and its three neighboring nodes.

Let's find all the 3-star configurations in the graph:

1. Node 11 forms a star with nodes 7, 1, and 8: <11, (7, 1, 8)>
2. Node 16 forms a star with nodes 21, 22, and 27: <16, (21, 22, 27)>
3. Node 27 forms a star with nodes 0, 18, and 1: <27, (0, 18, 1)>
4. Node 0 forms a star with nodes 21, 28, and 2: <0, (21, 28, 2)>
5. Node 20 forms a star with nodes 15, 12, and 2: <20, (15, 12, 2)>
6. Node 25 forms a star with nodes 9, 26, and 28: <25, (9, 26, 28)>
7. Node 17 forms a star with nodes 28, 12, and 18: <17, (28, 12, 18)>
8. Node 8 forms a star with nodes 19, 5, and 22: <8, (19, 5, 22)>
9. Node 29 forms a star with nodes 7, 19, and 13: <29, (7, 19, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph is [9].
