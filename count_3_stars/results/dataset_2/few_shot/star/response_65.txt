Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node and finding the number of 3-stars it is a part of. Since a 3-star involves a center node and three other leaves, we can check each node as a potential center.

Let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 17, 4, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6, 13)
- Node 3: (3, 13, 2, 5)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 16, 19)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 13, 16)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 14, 16)
- Node 10: (10, 6, 17, 9)
- Node 11: (11, 7, 12, 19)
- Node 12: (12, 7, 13, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 14, 3, 1)
- Node 14: (14, 8, 13, 18)
- Node 16: (16, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 17: (17, 3, 10, 15)
- Node 19: (19, 4, 11)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (17, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 13)>
<3, (13, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 19, 16)>
<6, (1, 13, 16)>
<8, (0, 14, 16)>
<10, (6, 17, 9)>
<11, (7, 12, 19)>
<12, (7, 13, 11)>
<13, (14, 3, 1)>
<14, (8, 13, 18)>
<16, (4, 6, 8)>
<17, (3, 10, 15)>
<19, (4, 11, 19)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [14].
