Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6)

Node 11 is connected to node 7, 12, 2, 3, 1, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, 14, 0, 6, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, 10, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node that acts as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node and exactly three other nodes that are connected to the center. We will then check all possible combinations for nodes that form 3-stars.

Given the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars and count them:

[9]

<9, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 12)>
<12, (9, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
