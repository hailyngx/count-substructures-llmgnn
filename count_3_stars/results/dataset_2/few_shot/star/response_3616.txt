Response:
Before counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (18, 7, 9)>
<1, (11, 15, 19)>
<2, (12, 6, 15)>
<3, (6, 19, 5)>
<4, (11, 0, 5)>
<5, (3, 15, 4)>
<6, (2, 12, 14)>
<7, (0, 14, 9)>
<9, (18, 0, 7)>
<11, (1, 4, 1)>
<12, (2, 17, 6)>
<13, (0, 17, 10)>
<15, (2, 1, 5)>
<17, (18, 13, 12)>
<18, (9, 0, 17)>
<19, (3, 1, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [16]
