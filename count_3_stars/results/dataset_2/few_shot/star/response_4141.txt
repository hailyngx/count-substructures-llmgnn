Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 1, 19, and the center of one star.
- Node 4: Connected to 10, 2, 16, and the center of one star.
- Node 5: Connected to 17, 16, and the center of one star.
- Node 6: Connected to 17, 1, 7, and the center of one star.
- Node 8: Connected to 14, 17, 12, and the center of one star.
- Node 12: Connected to 18, 6, 8, and the center of one star.
- Node 16: Connected to 17, 5, 4, and the center of one star.
- Node 17: Connected to 14, 6, 16, and the center of one star.
- Node 18: Connected to 14, 2, 12, and the center of one star.
- Node 19: Connected to 0, 9, and the center of one star.

Now, we will construct the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their connected nodes:
- From Node 0: <0, (1, 19, center)>
- From Node 4: <4, (10, 2, 16)>
- From Node 5: <5, (17, 16, center)>
- From Node 6: <6, (17, 1, 7)>
- From Node 8: <8, (14, 17, 12)>
- From Node 12: <12, (18, 6, center)>
- From Node 16: <16, (17, 5, 4)>
- From Node 17: <17, (14, 6, 16)>
- From Node 18: <18, (14, 2, 12)>
- From Node 19: <19, (0, 9, center)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 19, center)>
<4, (10, 2, 16)>
<5, (17, 16, center)>
<6, (17, 1, 7)>
<8, (14, 17, 12)>
<12, (18, 6, center)>
<16, (17, 5, 4)>
<17, (14, 6, 16)>
<18, (14, 2, 12)>
<19, (0, 9, center)>
