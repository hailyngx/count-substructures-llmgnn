Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 4, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
