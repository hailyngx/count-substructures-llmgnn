Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph step by step:

1. Start with Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
   - 3 possible 3-star structures involving Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 9, 3)>, <0, (3, 1, 9)>.
   
2. Move to Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, 5, and 0.
   - Possible 3-star structures involving Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 2)>.
   
3. Proceed to Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 9, and 8.
   - No 3-star structures involving Node 2 as the central node.
   
4. Evaluate Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 0, 2, and 8.
   - 3-star structures involving Node 3: <3, (7, 1, 0)>.
   
5. Examine Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 6.
   - No 3-star structures involving Node 4 as the central node.
   
6. Move to Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 6.
   - No 3-star structures involving Node 5 as the central node.
   
7. Proceed to Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 9, 5, and 2.
   - Possible 3-star structures involving Node 6: <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>, <6, (4, 9, 1)>, <6, (4, 9, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 9, 5)>.
   
8. Evaluate Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 8.
   - No 3-star structures involving Node 7 as the central node.
   
9. Examine Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, and 2.
   - Possible 3-star structures involving Node 8: <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>.
   
10. Move to Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 2, and 0.
   - Possible 3-star structures involving Node 9: <9, (7, 6, 2)>.
   
Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <3, (7, 1, 0)>, <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>, <6, (4, 9, 1)>, <6, (4, 9, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (7, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
