Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 1, 23)>
2. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (15, 17, 11)>
3. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (3, 14, 23)>
4. Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (1, 2, 5)>
5. Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (27, 18, 7)>
6. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (20, 16, 29)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (8, 2, 16)>
8. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (22, 12, 6)>
9. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (14, 27, 20)>
10. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (12, 20, 29)>
11. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (13, 25, 16)>
