Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 13, 18, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 9, and node 17
Node 3 is connected to node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 17
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 6, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 10, 5, 17, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 16, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 16, 10, 0, 6, and node 17
Node 12 is connected to node 18, and node 15
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 5, 19, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 19, and node 15
Node 15 is connected to node 12, and node 14
Node 16 is connected to node 11, 17, and node 9
Node 17 is connected to node 11, 16, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 18 is connected to node 1, and node 12
Node 19 is connected to node 13, and node 14

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<11, (0, 6, 17)>
<16, (9, 11, 17)>
<1, (7, 13, 18)>
<13, (1, 7, 19)>
<4, (0, 8, 17)>
<5, (6, 10, 13)>
<6, (2, 10, 11)>
<9, (2, 16, 17)>
<12, (15, 18, 12)>
<14, (15, 19, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
