Node 2 is connected to node 3, 10, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 11, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 14, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 13, 3, 0, 14, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 11, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 13

Response:
The center of a 3-star graph has degree 3 and the leaves have degree 1. Based on the given adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: (0, 4, 3, 6)
- From node 1: (1, 9, 11, 10)
- From node 2: (2, 3, 10, 7)
- From node 3: (3, 4, 11, 6)
- From node 6: (6, 8, 13, 0)
- From node 9: (9, 5, 1, 13)
- From node 11: (11, 8, 3, 14)
- From node 13: (13, 5, 9, 12)
- From node 14: (14, 4, 8, 13)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 3, 6)>, <1, (9, 11, 10)>, <2, (3, 10, 7)>, <3, (4, 11, 6)>, <6, (8, 13, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 13)>, <11, (8, 3, 14)>, <13, (5, 9, 12)>, <14, (4, 8, 13)>.
