Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (4, 8, 6) forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center.
2. Node 1: (11, 2, 14) forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 2: (1, 13, 11) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center.
4. Node 3: (11, 10, 6) forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center.
5. Node 4: (12, 9, 0) forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
6. Node 5: (7, 13, 10) forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center.
7. Node 6: (3, 8, 13) forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.
8. Node 7: (12, 10, 5) forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center.
9. Node 8: (7, 13, 14) forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center.
10. Node 9: (4, 3, 12) forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center.
11. Node 10: (7, 3, 5) forms a 3-star with node 10 as the center.
12. Node 11: (1, 3, 9) forms a 3-star with node 11 as the center.
13. Node 12: (4, 7, 13) forms a 3-star with node 12 as the center.
14. Node 13: (8, 5, 12) forms a 3-star with node 13 as the center.
15. Node 14: (4, 1, 8) forms a 3-star with node 14 as the center.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<1, (11, 2, 14)>
<2, (1, 13, 11)>
<3, (11, 10, 6)>
<4, (12, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 13, 10)>
<6, (3, 8, 13)>
<7, (12, 10, 5)>
<8, (7, 13, 14)>
<9, (4, 3, 12)>
<10, (7, 3, 5)>
<11, (1, 3, 9)>
<12, (4, 7, 13)>
<13, (8, 5, 12)>
<14, (4, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
