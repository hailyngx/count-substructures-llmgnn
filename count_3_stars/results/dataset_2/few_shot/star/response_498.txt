Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node acts as the center of a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are node 0, node 1, node 2, and node 3. Let's analyze each of them:

Node 0:
- Node 4, 7, and 6 are connected to node 0. These pairs can form 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is 1.

Node 1:
- Node 7, 8, and 6 are connected to node 1. These pairs can form 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is 1.

Node 2:
- Node 7, 0, and 9 are connected to node 2. These pairs can form 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is 1.

Node 3:
- Node 4, 5, and 6 are connected to node 3. These pairs can form 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is 1.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<2, (7, 0, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
