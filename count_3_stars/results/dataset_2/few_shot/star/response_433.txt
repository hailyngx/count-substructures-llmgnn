Response:
The total number of nodes is 30. Since each 3-star has a center node and 3 leaf nodes, and we have 30 nodes in total, the maximum number of 3-stars in this graph is 7. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (10, 2, 17)>
2. <1, (5, 29, 14)>
3. <4, (28, 26, 19)>
4. <6, (10, 16, 12)>
5. <7, (24, 11, 3)>
6. <9, (17, 13, 23)>
7. <20, (10, 8, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
