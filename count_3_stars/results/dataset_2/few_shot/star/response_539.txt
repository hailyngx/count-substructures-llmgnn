Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 8) (8, 19) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 2) (15, 7) (15, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 16)

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (7, 17, 16)>
<4, (1, 17, 12)>
<7, (2, 14, 15)>
<12, (4, 9, 5)>
<16, (2, 3, 1)>
<17, (4, 14, 0)>
<18, (14, 0, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
