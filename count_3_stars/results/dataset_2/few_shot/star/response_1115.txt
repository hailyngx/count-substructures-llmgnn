Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

1. Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
- Node 14: connected to nodes 11, 1, and 9  
- Node 19: connected to nodes 10, 0, and 13  

2. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<14, (11, 1, 9)>
<19, (10, 0, 13)>

Since we found 2 unique 3-stars, the final count of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].
