Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's go through each node and its neighbors to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   - Possible 3-star: (0, 6, 1), (0, 6, 8)
  
2. For node 1:
   - Possible 3-star: (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 9), (1, 4, 7), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 9), (1, 3, 8), (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 9), (1, 7, 9)
  
3. For node 2:
   - No 3-stars possible as it has less than 3 neighbors.

4. For node 3:
   - Possible 3-star: (3, 1, 6), (3, 1, 9), (3, 1, 8)
  
5. For node 4:
   - Possible 3-star: (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 9), (4, 7, 9)
  
6. For node 5:
   - No 3-stars possible as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
7. For node 6:
   - Possible 3-star: (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 8), (6, 1, 0), (6, 1, 2), (6, 3, 8), (6, 3, 2), (6, 8, 0), (6, 8, 2), (6, 0, 2)
  
8. For node 7:
   - Possible 3-star: (7, 4, 9), (7, 4, 1), (7, 4, 5), (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 8), (7, 9, 1), (7, 9, 5), (7, 9, 8)
  
9. For node 8:
   - Possible 3-star: (8, 0, 9), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 3), (8, 6, 3), (8, 6, 2), (8, 3, 9)
  
10. For node 9:
   - Possible 3-star: (9, 4, 1), (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 7), (9, 1, 3), (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 8), (9, 3, 2), (9, 3, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 1, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
