Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and check if there are any 3-stars centered at that node:

- For Node 0: No 3-star centered at Node 0 because it has 5 neighbors.
- For Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 14)>
- For Node 2: No 3-star centered at Node 2 because it has 4 neighbors.
- For Node 3: No 3-star centered at Node 3 because it has 5 neighbors.
- For Node 4: No 3-star centered at Node 4 because it has 3 neighbors.
- For Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 14)>
- For Node 6: <6, (5, 14, 11)>
- For Node 7: No 3-star centered at Node 7 because it has 4 neighbors.
- For Node 8: No 3-star centered at Node 8 because it has 4 neighbors.
- For Node 9: No 3-star centered at Node 9 because it has 4 neighbors.
- For Node 10: No 3-star centered at Node 10 because it has 2 neighbors.
- For Node 11: No 3-star centered at Node 11 because it has 3 neighbors.
- For Node 12: No 3-star centered at Node 12 because it has 3 neighbors.
- For Node 13: No 3-star centered at Node 13 because it has 3 neighbors.
- For Node 14: No 3-star centered at Node 14 because it has 4 neighbors.

So, the 3-stars in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 5, 14)>
- <5, (1, 3, 14)>
- <6, (5, 14, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
