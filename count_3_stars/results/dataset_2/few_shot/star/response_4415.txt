Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 0, 2, and 5 have exactly three neighbors each, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)> 
<5, (6, 7, 9)> 

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
