Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star structure around a central node:

1. Node 1: (3, 4, 8)
2. Node 3: (1, 11, 14)
3. Node 4: (1, 10, 14)
4. Node 5: (3, 14, 2)
5. Node 6: (7, 2, 13)
6. Node 7: (6, 9, 13)
7. Node 8: (1, 11, 12)
8. Node 9: (7, 12, 6)
9. Node 10: (1, 2, 4)
10. Node 11: (3, 8, 12)
11. Node 12: (11, 5, 8)
12. Node 13: (7, 6, 2)
13. Node 14: (3, 11, 4)

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 10, 14)>
<5, (3, 14, 2)>
<6, (7, 2, 13)>
<7, (6, 9, 13)>
<8, (1, 11, 12)>
<9, (7, 12, 6)>
<10, (1, 2, 4)>
<11, (3, 8, 12)>
<12, (11, 5, 8)>
<13, (7, 6, 2)>
<14, (3, 11, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get:
[13]
