Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected in star-like patterns:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 14 (1 star).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, and 7 (1 star).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 3, and 13 (1 star).
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 11, and 15 (1 star).
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 2, 3, and 18 (no star).
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 11 (no star).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 17 (no star).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 16 (no star).
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 4 (no star).
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9 and 10 (no star).
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 19 (no star).
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 12, 2, and 18 (no star).
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 18 (no star).
- Node 14 is connected to node 5 (no star).
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 12 and 17 (no star).
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4 and 18 (no star).
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 15, and 4 (no star).
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 13, 1, 11, and 16 (no star).
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2 and 10 (no star).

Step 2: Count the 3-stars from the identified nodes:
- Total number of 3-stars: 4
- List of 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 0, 14)>
<9, (5, 8, 11)>
<7, (9, 12, 3)>
<12, (7, 13, 11)>
