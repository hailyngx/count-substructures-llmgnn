Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 12, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 4, 8, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 13, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 12, 2, 1, 14, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 12, 14, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 13, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 14, 7, 13, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 12, 5, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 7, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
After analyzing the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (8, 1, 6)>
<3, (10, 4, 12)>
<4, (11, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 13, 14)>
<6, (10, 12, 0)>
<7, (11, 12, 14)>
<8, (2, 3, None)>
<9, (10, 13, 1)>
<10, (3, 6, 9)>
<11, (14, 7, 13)>
<12, (7, 13, 3)>
<13, (11, 12, 5)>
<14, (11, 7, 5)>
Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
