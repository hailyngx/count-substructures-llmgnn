Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then examine each of these configurations to determine if they meet the definition of a 3-star.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-star configurations:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 2)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
