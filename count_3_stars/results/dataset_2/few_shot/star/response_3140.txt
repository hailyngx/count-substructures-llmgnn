Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from each node, check if there are two edges going out from that node.
2. For each such node, check if the two nodes it connects to are already connected to each other.
3. If the two nodes are connected, then there is a 3-star with the current node as the center and the other two nodes as leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 18, 19)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (6, 11, 13)>
<3, (5, 10, None)>
<4, (1, 13, 18)>
<5, (3, 8, 13)>
<6, (2, 9, 17)>
<7, (8, 10, None)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 16, None)>
<10, (3, 7, 11)>
<11, (2, 12, 17)>
<12, (11, 18, None)>
<13, (2, 4, 5)>
<14, (16, 19, None)>
<15, (4, 19, None)>
<16, (14, 17, None)>
<17, (6, 11, 16)>
<18, (4, 12, None)>
<19, (0, 14, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
