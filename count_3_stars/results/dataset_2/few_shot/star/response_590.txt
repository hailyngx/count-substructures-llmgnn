Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 17, 12)>
<4, (1, 17, 16)>
<4, (1, 17, 2)>
<7, (12, 17, 16)>
<12, (17, 6, 16)>
<0, (10, 3, 11)>
<14, (15, 13, 19)>
<10, (0, 18, 4)>
<15, (18, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
