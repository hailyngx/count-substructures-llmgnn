Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 1: (15, 24, 27) <1, (15, 24, 27)>
2. Node 1: (13, 19, 28) <1, (13, 19, 28)>
3. Node 2: (11, 28, 29) <2, (11, 28, 29)>
4. Node 3: (10, 12, 23) <3, (10, 12, 23)>
5. Node 4: (22, 14, 26) <4, (22, 14, 26)>
6. Node 5: (6, 9, 0) <5, (6, 9, 0)>
7. Node 7: (18, 19, 7) <7, (18, 19, 7)>
8. Node 8: (16, 25, 22) <8, (16, 25, 22)>
9. Node 9: (19, 0, 5) <9, (19, 0, 5)>
10. Node 11: (25, 29, 28) <11, (25, 29, 28)>
11. Node 12: (18, 27, 3) <12, (18, 27, 3)>
12. Node 13: (25, 28, 19) <13, (25, 28, 19)>
13. Node 14: (4, 22, 26) <14, (4, 22, 26)>
14. Node 16: (8, 9, 18) <16, (8, 9, 18)>
15. Node 17: (20, 29, 21) <17, (20, 29, 21)>
16. Node 18: (16, 12, 27) <18, (16, 12, 27)>
17. Node 20: (17, 24, 29) <20, (17, 24, 29)>
18. Node 22: (25, 4, 26) <22, (25, 4, 26)>
19. Node 23: (10, 21, 15) <23, (10, 21, 15)>
20. Node 26: (22, 4, 27) <26, (22, 4, 27)>
21. Node 28: (25, 13, 2) <28, (25, 13, 2)>
22. Node 29: (20, 11, 28) <29, (20, 11, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
