Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

Counting these 3-stars, we find a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
