Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

2. For each central node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we will list it as a 3-star structure.

Let's go through each central node to find the 3-star structures:

For central node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 8. This forms a 3-star with <0, (6, 19, 8)>.

For central node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15 and 10. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10 and 7. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9 and 15. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9 and 14. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 9, and 19. This forms a 3-star with <5, (11, 9, 19)>.

For central node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 14, and 8. This forms a 3-star with <6, (16, 14, 8)>.

For central node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 18. This forms a 3-star with <7, (11, 2, 18)>.

For central node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 6, and 12. This forms a 3-star with <8, (17, 6, 12)>.

For central node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3. This forms a 3-star with <9, (5, 4, 3)>.

For central node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 19. This forms a 3-star with <10, (17, 1, 19)>.

For central node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 5. This forms a 3-star with <11, (16, 7, 5)>.

For central node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8 and 19. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9 and 14. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 16, 6, and 4. This forms a 3-star with <14, (16, 6, 4)>.

For central node 15:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For central node 16:
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 18, and 14. This forms a 3-star with <16, (11, 18, 14)>.

For central node 17:
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 18. This forms a 3-star with <17, (10, 8, 18)>.

For central node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16, 17, and 7. This forms a 3-star with <18, (16, 17, 7)>.

For central node 19:
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 12. This forms a 3-star with <19, (5, 10, 12)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 19, 8)>, <5, (11, 9, 19)>, <6, (16, 14, 8)>, <7, (11, 2, 18)>, <8, (17, 6, 12)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <10, (17, 1, 19)>, <11, (16, 7, 5)>, <14, (16, 6, 4)>.
