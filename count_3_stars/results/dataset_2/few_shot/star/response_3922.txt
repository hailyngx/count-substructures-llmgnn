Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 11, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 14, 5, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 13, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 14, 10, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 6, 9, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 12, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 3, 12, 13, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 12, 5, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 10, 11, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, 10, and node 9

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars can be found by looking at each node and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<1, (14, 13, 5)>
<2, (3, 10, 9)>
<3, (10, 9, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (1, 13, 8)>
<6, (7, 14, 10)>
<7, (4, 12, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 0)>
<9, (7, 3, 13)>
<10, (4, 3, 12)>
<11, (12, 5, 0)>
<12, (7, 10, 11)>
<13, (7, 1, 5)>
<14, (1, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [14].
