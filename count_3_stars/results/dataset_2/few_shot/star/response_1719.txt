Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 16 (neighbors: 2, 15, center)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 16, 6, center)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 8, 27, center)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 17, 28, center)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 9, 8, center)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 2, center)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 9, 23, center)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 25, 20, center)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 5, 6, center)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 15, 26, center)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 5, 25, center)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 10, 28, center)

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (16, 6, 15)>
<5, (9, 23, 12)>
<7, (25, 20, center)>
<8, (17, 28, center)>
<9, (5, 6, center)>
<10, (15, 26, center)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
