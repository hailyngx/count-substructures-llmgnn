Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. We will count the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 15 (neighbors: 3, 6, 11)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 1, 2, 15)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 4, 19, 27)
- Node 23 (neighbors: 5, 28, 29)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 15, there is 1 3-star: <15, (3, 6, 11)>
- For Node 16, there is 1 3-star: <16, (1, 2, 15)>
- For Node 18, there is 1 3-star: <18, (4, 19, 27)>
- For Node 23, there is 1 3-star: <23, (5, 28, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
