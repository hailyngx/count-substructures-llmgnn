Response:
Given the graph information, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph to count and list them.
    
There are nine 3-stars in the graph, which are:
    
<4, (0, 5, 18)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 10, 18)>
<10, (2, 7, 14)>
<12, (16, 17, 18)>
<15, (8, 7, 14)>
<16, (11, 12, 17)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
