Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the adjacency list information given. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to count the number of 3-stars for each node in the graph.

Let's calculate it step by step for each node:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, which are (2, 3, 6, 13). 
    - Possible 3-star centers: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 13), (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 13), (0, 6, 13)
    - 6 3-stars in total

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, which are (4, 5, 7, 10, 14).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 10), (1, 4, 14), (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 10), (1, 5, 14), (1, 7, 10), (1, 7, 14), (1, 10, 14)
    - 10 3-stars in total

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which are (0, 6, 9, 10).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (2, 0, 6), (2, 0, 9), (2, 0, 10), (2, 6, 9), (2, 6, 10), (2, 9, 10)
    - 6 3-stars in total

4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, which are (4, 5, 8, 13, 0).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 8), (3, 4, 13), (3, 4, 0), (3, 5, 8), (3, 5, 13), (3, 5, 0), (3, 8, 13), (3, 8, 0), (3, 13, 0)
    - 10 3-stars in total

5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors, which are (1, 3, 8).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 8), (4, 3, 8)
    - 3 3-stars in total

    - Possible 3-star centers: (7, 1, 10), (7, 1, 13), (7, 10, 13)
    - 3 3-stars in total

9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors, which are (3, 4, 9).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 9), (8, 4, 9)
    - 3 3-stars in total

10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, which are (2, 8, 12, 14).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (9, 2, 8), (9, 2, 12), (9, 2, 14), (9, 8, 12), (9, 8, 14), (9, 12, 14)

    - 10 3-stars in total

12. Node 11 has 3 neighbors, which are (12, 13, 14).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (11, 12, 13), (11, 12, 14), (11, 13, 14)
    - 3 3-stars in total

13. Node 12 has 4 neighbors, which are (4, 9, 11, 14).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (12, 4, 9), (12, 4, 11), (12, 4, 14), (12, 9, 11), (12, 9, 14), (12, 11, 14)
    - 6 3-stars in total

    - 10 3-stars in total

15. Node 14 has 5 neighbors, which are (1, 9, 10, 11, 12).
    - Possible 3-star centers: (14, 1, 9), (14, 1, 10),(14, 1, 11), (14, 1, 12), (14, 9, 10), (14, 9, 11), (14, 9, 12), (14, 10, 11), (14, 10, 12), (14, 11, 12)
    - 10 3-stars in total

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get:
6 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [79].
