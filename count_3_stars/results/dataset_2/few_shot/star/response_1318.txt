Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (6, 10, 2)>
<1, (8, 10, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<3, (9, 6, 12)>
<4, (7, 11, 13)>
<11, (9, 13, 1)>
<12, (2, 14, 3)>
<13, (5, 8, 11)>
<14, (6, 9, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
