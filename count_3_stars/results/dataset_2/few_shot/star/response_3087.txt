Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star in this graph. A node must be connected to exactly three other nodes to be the center of a 3-star.

Potential center nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to node 1 and node 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12 and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 14.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with each of these potential center nodes:

For Node 1:
- (1, 10, 4, 8) forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center.
<1, (10, 4, 8)>

For Node 3:
- There are no 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.

For Node 4:
- There are no 3-stars with Node 4 as the center.

For Node 7:
- There are no 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.

For Node 10:
- There are no 3-stars with Node 10 as the center.

For Node 11:
- (11, 5, 6, 14) forms a 3-star with Node 11 as the center.
<11, (5, 6, 14)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [2]
