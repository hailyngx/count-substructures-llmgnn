Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors
Nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 
- Node 11
- Node 16
- Node 15
- Node 10
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 17
- Node 111
- Node 4
- Node 18
- Node 7
- Node 12
- Node 21
- Node 9
- Node 19
- Node 25
- Node 28
- Node 29

Step 2: Search for 3-stars that can be formed with each identified node
Let's go through each of these nodes and see if they form a 3-star with its neighbors.

- For Node 11: <11, (3, 14, 1)>
- For Node 16: <16, (28, 18, 5)>
- For Node 15: <15, (27, 5, 12)>
- For Node 10: <10, (17, 2, 29)>
- For Node 1: <1, (11, 28, 9)>
- For Node 2: <2, (11, 10, 6)>
- For Node 5: <5, (16, 15, 29)>
- For Node 6: <6, (27, 24, 2)>
- For Node 17: <17, (10, 0, 12)>
- For Node 4: <4, (27, 3, 20)>
- For Node 18: <18, (16, 13, 28)>
- For Node 7: <7, (12, 20)>
- For Node 12: <12, (15, 17, 7)>
- For Node 21: <21, (20, 26)>
- For Node 9: <9, (22, 24, 3)>
- For Node 19: <19, (22, 0)>
- For Node 25: <25, (8)>
- For Node 28: <28, (16, 1)>
- For Node 29: <29, (10, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
