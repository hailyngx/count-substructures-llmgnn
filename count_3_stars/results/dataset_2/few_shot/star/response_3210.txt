Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 16 and node 19.
   - As Node 0 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to node 10, 19, and node 9.
   - <1, (10, 19, 9)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 15.
   - <2, (8, 3, 15)>

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to node 12, 2, 11, and node 9.
   - <3, (12, 2, 11)>

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 12, 16, and node 6.
   - <4, (12, 16, 6)>

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to node 13, 10, 17, and node 14.
   - <5, (13, 10, 17)>

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 14.
   - <6, (8, 4, 14)>

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to node 11 and node 19.
   - As Node 7 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to node 13, 2, and node 6.
   - <8, (13, 2, 6)>

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to node 13, 12, 1, 3, and node 16.
    - <9, (13, 12, 1)>

11. For Node 10:
    - Node 10 is connected to node 17, 18, 1, and node 5.
    - <10, (17, 18, 1)>

12. For Node 11:
    - Node 11 is connected to node 7 and node 3.
    - As Node 11 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

13. For Node 12:
    - Node 12 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9.
    - <12, (4, 3, 9)>

    - <14, (5, 6, 15)>

16. For Node 15:
    - Node 15 is connected to node 2 and node 14.
    - As Node 15 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

17. For Node 16:
    - Node 16 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9.
    - <16, (0, 4, 9)>

18. For Node 17:
    - Node 17 is connected to node 10 and node 5.
    - As Node 17 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

19. For Node 18:
    - Node 18 is connected to node 13 and node 10.
    - As Node 18 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be part of any 3-star.

20. For Node 19:
    - Node 19 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0.
    - <19, (7, 1, 0)>
