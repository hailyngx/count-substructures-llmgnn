Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 3. So, the 3-star <4, (7, 8, 3)> can be formed.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. So, the 3-star <1, (4, 6, 9)> can be formed.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5. So, the 3-star <6, (7, 9, 5)> can be formed.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 8. So, the 3-star <3, (4, 9, 8)> can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <4, (7, 8, 3)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 5)>
- <3, (4, 9, 8)>
