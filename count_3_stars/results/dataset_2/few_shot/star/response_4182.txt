Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

**Node 0:**
- Not part of any 3-star, as it doesn't have 3 neighboring nodes.

**Node 1:**
- 1 unique 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 0)>

**Node 2:**
- Not part of any 3-star, as it doesn't have 3 neighboring nodes.

**Node 3:**
- 2 unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>

**Node 4:**
- 3 unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>

**Node 5:**
- 3 unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>

**Node 6:**
- 1 unique 3-star: <6, (5, 9, 7)>

**Node 7:**
- Not part of any 3-star, as it doesn't have 3 neighboring nodes.

**Node 8:**
- Not part of any 3-star, as it doesn't have 3 neighboring nodes.

**Node 9:**
- 3 unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

**Total number of 3-stars: [13]**
**Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>**
