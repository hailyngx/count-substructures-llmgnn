Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and count the possible 3-stars centered at that node.

Here are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 6 (Neighbors: 9, 10, 1)
- Node 2 (Neighbors: 1, 12, -)
- Node 4 (Neighbors: 16, 14, -)
- Node 7 (Neighbors: 1, 17, -)
- Node 12 (Neighbors: 2, -, -)

Now we will count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. Node 6:
   - 3-star: <6, (9, 10, 1)> 
   - 3-star: <6, (9, 10, 16)>
   - Total: 2
     
2. Node 2:
   - 3-star: <2, (1, 12, 3)>
   - Total: 1

3. Node 4:
   - 3-star: <4, (16, 14, 3)>
   - Total: 1

4. Node 7:
   - 3-star: <7, (1, 17, 5)>
   - Total: 1

5. Node 12:
   - 3-star: <12, (2, -, -)> (This is not a valid 3-star as it requires exactly 3 neighbors for each node, but included for completeness)
   - Total: 0

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <6, (9, 10, 1)>, <6, (9, 10, 16)>, <2, (1, 12, 3)>, <4, (16, 14, 3)>, <7, (1, 17, 5)>.
