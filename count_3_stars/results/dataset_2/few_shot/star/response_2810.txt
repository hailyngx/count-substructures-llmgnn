Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <2, (21, 11, 0)>
2. <2, (21, 28, 15)>
3. <21, (2, 12, 8)>
4. <21, (2, 28, 15)>
5. <21, (2, 12, 23)>
6. <3, (18, 29, 24)>
7. <7, (1, 19, 25)>
8. <7, (29, 19, 25)>
9. <14, (15, 22, 7)>
10. <22, (5, 25, 14)>
11. <22, (5, 14, 24)>
12. <22, (14, 25, 24)>
13. <24, (9, 22, 3)>
14. <27, (29, 13, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
