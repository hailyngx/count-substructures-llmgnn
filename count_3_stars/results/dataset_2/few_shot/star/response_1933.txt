Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Analyze the adjacency list to identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1: 2 neighbors
   - Node 3: 2 neighbors
   - Node 21: 3 neighbors
   - Node 5: 3 neighbors
   - Node 9: 4 neighbors
   - Node 7: 3 neighbors
   - Node 8: 2 neighbors
   - Node 10: 2 neighbors
   - Node 12: 1 neighbor
   - Node 14: 3 neighbors
   - Node 16: 3 neighbors
   - Node 18: 4 neighbors
   - Node 19: 4 neighbors
   - Node 25: 4 neighbors
   - Node 27: 3 neighbors
   - Node 29: 3 neighbors

2. Identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
   - From the adjacency list, the possible 3-stars can be formed with nodes having exactly 3 neighbors.
   
3. Counting the 3-stars:
   - 3-star patterns: <1, (3, 21, 25)>, <5, (7, 9, 25)>, <7, (5, 13, 6)>, <8, (9, 2, -)>, <10, (9, 26, -)>, <12, (19, -, -)>, <14, (9, 26, 15)>, <16, (18, 15, 0)>, <18, (4, 16, 13)>, <19, (27, 23, 24)>, <27, (11, 17, 19)>, <29, (22, 6, 24)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
