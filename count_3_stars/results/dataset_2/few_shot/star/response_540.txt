Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that node 5, node 7, and node 4 can form a 3-star with their connections:
<5, (7, 4, 19)>
This is the only unique 3-star in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star graph is <5, (7, 4, 19)>.
