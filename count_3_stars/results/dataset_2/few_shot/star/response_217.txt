Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's now list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (5, 7, 16)>
<6, (13, 15, 19)>
<8, (3, 7, 13)>
<12, (0, 9, 14)>
<13, (6, 8, 11)>
<15, (6, 9, 17)>
<18, (4, 7, 19)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
