Response:
Starting with Node 0: 
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 14, and 5 <0, (4, 14, 5)>.

Moving on to Node 1: 
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 4 <1, (6, 9, 4)>.

Next is Node 2: 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 8 <2, (9, 10, 8)>.

Moving on to Node 3: 
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 14 <3, (9, 10, 14)>.

Next is Node 4: 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 1 <4, (6, 8, 1)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 5, and 0 <4, (6, 5, 0)>.

Moving on to Node 5: 
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 7, and 14 <5, (10, 7, 14)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 0, and 4 <5, (10, 0, 4)>.

No 3-stars found for Node 6.

Moving on to Node 7: 
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 2, and 5 <7, (8, 2, 5)>.

No 3-stars found for Node 8.

Moving on to Node 9: 
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 1 <9, (2, 3, 1)>.

Moving on to Node 10: 
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 3, and 13 <10, (11, 3, 13)>.

Moving on to Node 11: 
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 3, and 12 <11, (10, 3, 12)>.

Moving on to Node 12: 
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 14 <12, (11, 8, 14)>.

No 3-stars found for Node 13.

Moving on to Node 14: 
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 0, and 3 <14, (12, 0, 3)>.
