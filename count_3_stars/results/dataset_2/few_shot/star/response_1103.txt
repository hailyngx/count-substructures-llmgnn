Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the specific pattern stated in the question, which is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through the adjacency list and identify the 3-stars:

- From node 0: No 3-star.
- From node 1: No 3-star.
- From node 2: <2, (10, 19, 14)>
- From node 3: No 3-star.
- From node 4: No 3-star.
- From node 5: <5, (10, 8, 19)>
- From node 6: No 3-star.
- From node 7: No 3-star.
- From node 8: No 3-star.
- From node 9: <9, (17, 10, 6)>
- From node 10: No 3-star.
- From node 11: No 3-star.
- From node 12: No 3-star.
- From node 13: No 3-star.
- From node 14: No 3-star.
- From node 15: No 3-star.
- From node 16: No 3-star.
- From node 17: No 3-star.
- From node 18: No 3-star.
- From node 19: No 3-star.

Hence, the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (10, 19, 14)> and <9, (17, 10, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
