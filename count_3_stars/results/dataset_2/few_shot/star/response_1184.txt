Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 6, 3)>
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 3, 2)>
3. Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 0)>
4. Node 3: <3, (5, 1, 0)>
5. Node 4: <4, (6, 8, 0)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 8)>
8. Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 6)>
9. Node 8: <8, (6, 1, 4)>
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
