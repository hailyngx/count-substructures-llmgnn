Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node and checking if it serves as the center of a 3-star. Let's go through each node and identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
    - <0, (3, 17, 15)>
    - <0, (3, 18, 6)>

2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (3, 9, 19)>

3. For Node 3:
    - <3, (16, 1, 14)>
    - <3, (16, 0, 15)>
    - <3, (16, 14, 5)>

4. For Node 4:
    - <4, (11, 18, 12)>
    - <4, (11, 18, 0)>

5. For Node 5:
    - <5, (16, 13, 7)>

6. For Node 6:
    - <6, (14, 0, -)>

7. For Node 8:
    - <8, (9, 19, 1)>
    - <8, (9, 19, 10)>
    - <8, (9, 14, 7)>

8. For Node 9:
    - <9, (1, 19, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 19, 10)>

9. For Node 12:
    - <12, (10, 18, 4)>
    - <12, (10, 18, 0)>

10. For Node 13:
    - <13, (16, 5, 7)>

11. For Node 14:
    - <14, (3, 8, 6)>
    - <14, (3, 8, 2)>

12. For Node 16:
    - <16, (11, 5, 15)>
    - <16, (11, 5, 7)>

13. For Node 19:
    - <19, (1, 10, 8)>

From the analysis above, we can see that there are a total of 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
