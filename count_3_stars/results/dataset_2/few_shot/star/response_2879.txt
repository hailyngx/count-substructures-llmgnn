Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph information, we can analyze the connections of each node to find all the 3-stars. Here are the identified 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes:
    
1. <1, (10, 8, 14)>
2. <2, (11, 13, 3)>
3. <3, (6, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (10, 11, 13)>
5. <5, (6, 2, -)>
6. <6, (8, 5, 7)>
7. <7, (11, 6, 0)>
8. <8, (13, 14, 6)>
9. <9, (10, 7, 14)>
10. <10, (11, 1, 4)>
11. <11, (10, 7, 13)>
12. <13, (11, 8, 4)>
13. <14, (8, 12, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
