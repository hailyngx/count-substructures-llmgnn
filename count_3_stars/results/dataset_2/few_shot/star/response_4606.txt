Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node's neighbors and check if there exists a 3-star around that node (i.e., a central node with 3 connected nodes).

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors which form a star shape: <0, (6, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors which form a star shape: <1, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors but does not form a star shape.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors but does not form a star shape.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors which form two star shapes: <4, (6, 9, 5)> and <4, (6, 8, 0)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors which form two star shapes: <5, (1, 4, 8)> and <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors which form a star shape: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors which form a star shape: <7, (9, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors which form multiple star shapes: <8, (6, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, and <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors but does not form a star shape.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 5)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
