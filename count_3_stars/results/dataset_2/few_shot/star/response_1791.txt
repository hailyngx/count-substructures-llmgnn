Response:
The central nodes of the 3-star graphs will be nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 12 has 1 neighbor
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor

All the other nodes have 3 or more neighbors. Now we need to find the 3-stars by focusing on nodes with exactly 3 neighbors since the central node of a 3-star should have exactly 3 neighbors.

From the given graph, the possible central nodes for 3-stars are:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 7, 3, 17)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 4, 5, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 7, 9, 1)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 10, 1, 15)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 9, 0, 5)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 3, 14, 17)

Let's now find the 3-stars:

<tr>
<4, (7, 17, 3)>
<4, (2, 0, 7)>
<4, (2, 0, 17)>
<7, (5, 8, 4)>
<8, (9, 1, 7)>
<13, (10, 15, 1)>
<18, (0, 5, 9)>
<11, (14, 17, 3)>
</tr>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
