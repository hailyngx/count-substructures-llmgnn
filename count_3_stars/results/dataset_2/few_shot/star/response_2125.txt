Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, which are candidates for being the center of a 3-star. These nodes are:  
Node 7 (neighbors: 21, 16, 28), Node 15 (neighbors: 21, 10, 12), Node 22 (neighbors: 8, 5, 22), and Node 24 (neighbors: 19, 9, 18).

Next, let's check each candidate node to see if they form a 3-star. Based on the given information, we can form the following 3-stars:  
<7, (21, 16, 28)>  
<15, (21, 10, 12)>  
<22, (8, 5, 22)>  
<24, (19, 9, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
