Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are three 3-stars in this graph based on the definition provided. Let's list them:

<0, (9, 1, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
