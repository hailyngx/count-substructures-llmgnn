Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the unique 3-stars:

<0, (17, 3, 18)>
<1, (2, 9, 4)>
<2, (1, 13, 4)>
<3, (5, 0, 12)>
<4, (6, 2, 12)>
<5, (6, 18, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, x)> (Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
<7, (14, 10, 9)>
<8, (17, 9, 18)>
<9, (8, 18, 1)>
<10, (17, 15, 7)>
<11, (16, x, 12)> (Node 11 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
<12, (11, 13, 3)>
<13, (16, 2, 12)>
<14, (7, x, 15)> (Node 14 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
<15, (14, 10, 19)>
<16, (11, x, 13)> (Node 16 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
<17, (10, 0, 8)>
<18, (5, 8, 9)>
<19, (15, x, 1)> (Node 19 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
