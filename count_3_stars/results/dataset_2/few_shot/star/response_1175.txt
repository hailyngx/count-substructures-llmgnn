Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the central nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 18, 4, 7)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 17, 14, 19)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 7, 13, 14)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 8, 12, 0)
- Node 5 (connected to node 13)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 7, 11)
- Node 10 (connected to node 8)
- Node 16 (connected to node 19)

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (18, 4, 7)>
<1, (17, 14, 19)>
<3, (7, 13, 14)>
<4, (8, 12, 0)>
<5, (13)>
<6, (7, 11)>
<10, (8)>
<16, (19)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
