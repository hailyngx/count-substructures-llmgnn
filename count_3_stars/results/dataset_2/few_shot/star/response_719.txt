Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes involved in each 3-star:
- Node 0: (9, 4, 6)
- Node 1: (4, 6, 2)
- Node 2: (9, 4, 8)
- Node 3: (5, 9, 3)
- Node 4: (7, 8, 2)
- Node 6: (7, 1, 2)
- Node 8: (9, 4, 3)
- Node 9: (5, 8, 3)

So, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>

There are **8** unique 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is: **[8]**.
