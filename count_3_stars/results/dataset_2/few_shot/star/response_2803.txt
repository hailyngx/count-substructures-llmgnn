Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (9, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 3)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
