Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes 9, 26, 5, 10, 13 have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. Let's find the leaves of the 3-stars for each of these center nodes:

1. For node 9:
   Leaves: 26, 5, 24
   <9, (26, 5, 24)>

2. For node 26:
   Leaves: 9, 14, 10
   <26, (9, 14, 10)>

3. For node 5:
   Leaves: 9, 19, 2
   <5, (9, 19, 2)>

4. For node 10:
   Leaves: 26, 6, 28
   <10, (26, 6, 28)>

5. For node 13:
   Leaves: 6, 29, 0
   <13, (6, 29, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
