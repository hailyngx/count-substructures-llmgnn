Response:
The total number of possible 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by checking each node and counting the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the central node. Since a 3-star consists of a center and three leaves, we will identify all unique 3-stars by examining each node's connections.

Here are the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (12, 14, 10)>
<1, (13, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 10, 3)>
<3, (13, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 12, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 14, 10)>
<7, (8, 3, 13)>
<8, (13, 10, 11)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<10, (8, 2, 6)>
<11, (9, 8, 12)>
<12, (9, 4, 0)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<14, (13, 6, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
