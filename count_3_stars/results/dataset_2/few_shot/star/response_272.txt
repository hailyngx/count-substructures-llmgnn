Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can examine each node and its connections to find 3-stars.

Checking each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two connections.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two connections.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 4: Possible 3-star: <4, (21, 8, 23)> (center: 4, leaves: 21, 8, 23)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 8: Possible 3-star: <8, (4, 19, 20)> (center: 8, leaves: 4, 19, 20)
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two connections.
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 15: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 16: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 17: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 18: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 19: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 20: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 21: Possible 3-star: <21, (13, 19, 4)> (center: 21, leaves: 13, 19, 4)
- Node 22: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 23: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 24: No 3-star can be formed since it has only one connection.
- Node 25: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 26: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 27: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.
- Node 28: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two connections.
- Node 29: No 3-star can be formed since it has more than three connections.

Counting the identified 3-stars:
- Identified 3-stars: <4, (21, 8, 23)>, <8, (4, 19, 20)>, <21, (13, 19, 4)>
- Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
