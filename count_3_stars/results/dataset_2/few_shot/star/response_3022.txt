Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying all the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

1. Node 16 has neighbors 7, 12, and 18. So, the 3-star involving the center node 16 would be <16, (7, 12, 18)>.

2. Node 4 has neighbors 7, 10, and 1. So, the 3-star involving the center node 4 would be <4, (7, 10, 1)>.

3. Node 9 has neighbors 5, 17, and 14. So, the 3-star involving the center node 9 would be <9, (5, 17, 14)>.

4. Node 5 has neighbors 9, 15, and 0. So, the 3-star involving the center node 5 would be <5, (9, 15, 0)>.

5. Node 1 has neighbors 17, 14, and 13. So, the 3-star involving the center node 1 would be <1, (17, 14, 13)>.

6. Node 13 has neighbors 1, 17, and 6. So, the 3-star involving the center node 13 would be <13, (1, 17, 6)>.

Adding all these unique 3-stars gives us 6 3-stars in total. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<16, (7, 12, 18)>
<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<9, (5, 17, 14)>
<5, (9, 15, 0)>
<1, (17, 14, 13)>
<13, (1, 17, 6)>
