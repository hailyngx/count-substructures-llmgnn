Response:
First, we can find nodes that have exactly three edges. These nodes will act as the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 9: (9, 14), (9, 2), and (9, unspecified node)
- Node 16: (16, 1), (16, 19), and (16, unspecified node)
- Node 19: (19, 11), (19, 16), and (19, unspecified node)

Next, we look for possible 3-stars starting from these central nodes:

From Node 9:
- <9, (14, 2, unspecified node)> [1 3-star]

From Node 16:
- <16, (1, 19, unspecified node)> [1 3-star]

From Node 19:
- <19, (11, 16, unspecified node)> [1 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
