Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in this graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors that are not connected to each other. 

Checking each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 23, 25), which form a 3-star: <4, (5, 23, 25)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 17, 13), which form a 3-star: <6, (9, 17, 13)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (10, 12, 28), which form a 3-star: <7, (10, 12, 28)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (18, 21, 2), but they are all connected to each other.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 14), which form a 3-star: <13, (6, 9, 14)>.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 16 has only one neighbor.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (6, 26, 15), but they are all connected to each other.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 19 has only one neighbor.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 22 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 24 has only one neighbor.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors (4, 11, 23), which form a 3-star: <25, (4, 11, 23)>.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, but they are connected to each other.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <4, (5, 23, 25)>
- <6, (9, 17, 13)>
- <7, (10, 12, 28)>
- <13, (6, 9, 14)>
- <25, (4, 11, 23)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found gives us a total of [5].
