Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to three other nodes. 

The central nodes will be: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 13

For each central node, we need to check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes and if those three nodes are not connected to each other. 

1. For central node 0:
   - Nodes connected to 0: 9, 13, 4, 5
   - Not a 3-star.

2. For central node 2:
   - Nodes connected to 2: 6, 11, 4, 1
   - Not a 3-star.

3. For central node 3:
   - Nodes connected to 3: 13, 12, 7, 14, 5
   - Not a 3-star.

4. For central node 5:
   - Nodes connected to 5: 3, 7, 1, 0
   - Not a 3-star.

5. For central node 8:
   - Nodes connected to 8: 9, 11, 13, 4, 12
   - Not a 3-star.

6. For central node 11:
   - Nodes connected to 11: 9, 10, 13, 8, 12, 2
   - <11, (9, 13, 8)>
   - <11, (10, 8, 12)>
   - <11, (13, 8, 2)>
   - <11, (12, 8, 4)>

7. For central node 13:
   - Nodes connected to 13: 11, 8, 3, 14, 0
   - <13, (11, 8, 3)>
   - <13, (14, 3, 0)>

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<11, (9, 13, 8)>
<11, (10, 8, 12)>
<11, (13, 8, 2)>
<11, (12, 8, 4)>
<13, (11, 8, 3)>
<13, (14, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
