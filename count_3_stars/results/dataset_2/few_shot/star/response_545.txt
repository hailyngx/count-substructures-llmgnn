Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 10.
   - <0, (6, 17, 10)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 2.
   - <1, (5, 15, 2)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 1.
   - <2, (16, 4, 1)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 19.
   - <3, (4, 13, 19)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 2.
   - <4, (8, 12, 2)>
   - <4, (8, 12, 3)>
   - <4, (8, 12, 5)>
   - <4, (8, 12, 6)>
   - <4, (3, 13, 12)>
   - <4, (3, 13, 19)>
   - <4, (2, 16, 4)>
   - <4, (2, 1, 4)>

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 1.
   - <5, (4, 6, 1)>

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 12.
   - <6, (5, 18, 12)>
   - <6, (5, 18, 19)>
   - <6, (5, 12, 10)>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 15, and 19.
   - <7, (16, 15, 19)>
   - <7, (16, 2, 7)>
   - <7, (15, 1, 7)>
   - <7, (15, 12, 7)>

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 15.
   - <8, (4, 9, 15)>

10. Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 0.
    - <10, (1, 12, 0)>
    - <10, (1, 12, 4)>
    - <10, (1, 12, 6)>
    - <10, (1, 12, 15)>

    - <13, (12, 3, 19)>

13. Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 14.
    - <18, (6, 19, 14)>

14. Node 19 is connected to nodes 13, 7, and 18.
    - <19, (13, 7, 18)>
    - <19, (13, 12, 19)>
    - <19, (7, 16, 19)>
    - <19, (7, 15, 19)>
