Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. We will look for each node and its connections to check if there are any 3-stars. 

Starting from node 0:
- <0, (6, 1, 2)>
- <0, (6, 1, 4)>

Moving to node 1:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 1.

Moving to node 2:
- <2, (5, 1, 3)>
- No additional 3-stars from node 2.

Moving to node 3:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 3.

Moving to node 4:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 4.

Moving to node 5:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 5.

Moving to node 6:
- <6, (9, 7, 4)>
- No additional 3-stars from node 6.
  
Moving to node 7:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 7.

Moving to node 8:
- No 3-stars are possible from node 8.

Moving to node 9:
- <9, (1, 7, 4)>
- No additional 3-stars from node 9.

Final Count = 3

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>.
