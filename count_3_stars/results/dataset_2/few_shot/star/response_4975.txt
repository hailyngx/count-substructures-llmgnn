Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (7, 3, 12)>
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<0, (8, 15, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 2, 19)>
<1, (5, 2, 13)>
<1, (5, 2, 12)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 17)>
<2, (9, 5, 19)>
<2, (9, 5, 13)>
<2, (9, 5, 12)>
<2, (9, 5, 2)>
<2, (13, 9, 2)>
<2, (13, 9, 5)>
<2, (13, 9, 1)>
<2, (12, 0, 7)>
<4, (11, 10, 5)>
<4, (11, 10, 1)>
<4, (11, 10, 4)>
<4, (10, 18, 16)>
<4, (5, 2, 1)>
<8, (15, 14, 1)>
<8, (15, 14, 8)>
<8, (18, 16, 19)>
<8, (18, 16, 10)>
<8, (18, 16, 6)>
<8, (18, 16, 9)>
<8, (18, 16, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
