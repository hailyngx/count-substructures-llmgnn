Response:
Firstly, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 edges since a 3-star involves one central node and three leaves. From the given adjacency list:
- Node 3 has exactly 1 edge.
- Node 27 has exactly 4 edges.
- Node 16 has exactly 1 edge.

Therefore, the 3-stars can be formed with the following central nodes:
- 27, with its connected nodes: 9, 24, 17
- (There are no more eligible central nodes based on the given information.) 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars based on each central node:
1. For node 27:
    - (27, 9, 24, 17) -> <27, (9, 24, 17)>
    
Thus, there is a total of [1] 3-star in the graph.
