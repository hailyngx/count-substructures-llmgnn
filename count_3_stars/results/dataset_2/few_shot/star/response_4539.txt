Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8)

Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. We can then identify the 3-stars by looking at the neighbors of these central nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 9, 3, and 8.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: nodes 9, 3, and 6.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 3, 4, 8, and 7.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: nodes 5, 3, 8, and 2.
5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 1, and 3.
6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: nodes 9, 8, and 2.
7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: nodes 8, 1, 7, and 0.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
