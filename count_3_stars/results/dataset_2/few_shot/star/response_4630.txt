Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of occurrences of each node as the center of a 3-star. 

Here is the calculation:
- Node 0 is the center of 1 3-star: <0, (5, 14, 11)>
- Node 1 is the center of 0 3-stars
- Node 2 is the center of 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 13)>
- Node 3 is the center of 0 3-stars
- Node 4 is the center of 2 3-stars: <4, (9, 11, 2)> and <4, (2, 8, 11)>
- Node 5 is the center of 2 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 14)> and <5, (9, 3, 0)>
- Node 6 is the center of 1 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 3)>
- Node 7 is the center of 0 3-stars
- Node 8 is the center of 1 3-star: <8, (2, 10, 6)>
- Node 9 is the center of 1 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 13)>
- Node 10 is the center of 0 3-stars
- Node 11 is the center of 2 3-stars: <11, (9, 4, 6)> and <11, (0, 1, 11)>
- Node 12 is the center of 1 3-star: <12, (3, 1, 13)>
- Node 13 is the center of 0 3-stars
- Node 14 is the center of 1 3-star: <14, (5, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
