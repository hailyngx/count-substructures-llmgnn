Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the potential center nodes are 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9 since they have connections to exactly 3 other nodes.

1. For center node 0:
    - <0, (9, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (9, 5, 2)>

2. For center node 1:
    - <1, (9, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (9, 3, 8)>

3. For center node 3:
    - <3, (9, 1, 8)>
    - <3, (9, 5, 6)>

4. For center node 7:
    - <7, (9, 4, 1)>
    - <7, (9, 0, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 0, 1)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 5)>

5. For center node 9:
    - <9, (7, 4, 1)>
    - <9, (7, 0, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 1, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [10]
