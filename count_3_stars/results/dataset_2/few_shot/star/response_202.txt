Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the given information:

- Central Node 0: Leaves 11, 16, 10
- Central Node 1: Leaves 5, 8, 13
- Central Node 2: Leaves 18, 3
- Central Node 3: Leaves 2, 8
- Central Node 4: Leaves 12, 14
- Central Node 5: Leaves 6, 1
- Central Node 6: Leaf 5
- Central Node 7: Leaves 16, 19
- Central Node 8: Leaves 9, 14
- Central Node 9: Leaves 8, 14
- Central Node 10: Leaves 6, 1
- Central Node 11: Leaves 16, 18
- Central Node 12: Leaves 16, 4
- Central Node 13: Leaf 18
- Central Node 14: Leaves 9, 4
- Central Node 15: Leaf 2
- Central Node 16: Leaves 11, 7
- Central Node 17: No leaves
- Central Node 18: Leaves 11, 7
- Central Node 19: Leaves 9, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (11, 16, 10)>
<1, (5, 8, 13)>
<2, (18, 3, 15)>
<3, (2, 8, 12)>
<4, (12, 16, 14)>
<5, (6, 1, 15)>
<8, (9, 14, 4)>
<9, (8, 14, 19)>
<11, (16, 18, 7)>
<18, (11, 7, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
