Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, 9, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's proceed step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9, and 8 (connected to exactly three other nodes: 3, 5, and 9)
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0 (connected to exactly three other nodes: 9, 7, and 0)
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7 (connected to exactly three other nodes: 3, 4, and 7)

2. Form the 3-stars using the identified central nodes:
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (9, 7, 0)>
   - <6, (3, 4, 7)>
