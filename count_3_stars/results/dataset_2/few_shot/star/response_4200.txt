Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the list of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <3, (4, 1, 0)>
2. <4, (7, 8, 5)>
3. <5, (7, 6, 0)>
4. <6, (1, 5, 2)>
5. <7, (4, 9, 5)>
6. <8, (4, 1, 3)>
7. <9, (7, 2, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
