Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the graph, we can see that nodes with a degree of 3 fit the definition of the center of a 3-star. These nodes are: 15, 6, 10, and 14.

Now, let's find the corresponding leaves for each center node:
- For node 15: (27, 4, 11)
- For node 6: (27, 18, 12)
- For node 10: (21, 13, 7)
- For node 14: (1, 26, 24)

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<15, (27, 4, 11)>
<6, (27, 18, 12)>
<10, (21, 13, 7)>
<14, (1, 26, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
