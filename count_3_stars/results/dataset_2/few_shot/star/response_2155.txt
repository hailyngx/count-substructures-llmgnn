Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's consider each node as a central node in turn and determine the 3-stars around it:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (5, 9, 4)>
   
2. For node 1:
   - <1, (9, 7, 8)>
   
3. For node 2:
   - <2, (4, 6, 1)>
   - <2, (4, 6, 3)>
   
4. For node 3:
   - <3, (5, 4, 8)>
   
5. For node 4:
   - <4, (9, 0, 2)>
   
6. For node 5:
   - <5, (9, 0, 3)>
   
7. For node 6:
   - <6, (7, 8, 2)>
   
8. For node 7:
   - <7, (6, 8, 1)>
   
9. For node 8:
   - <8, (9, 7, 6)>
   
10. For node 9:
   - <9, (5, 8, 4)>
   
There are a total of 10 unique 3-star configurations in this graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
