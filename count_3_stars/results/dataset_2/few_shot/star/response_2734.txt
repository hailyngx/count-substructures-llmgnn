Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 3, 7, and 2. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <0, (5, 7, 2)>
    
For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 4, and 0. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <1, (9, 0, 2)>
    
For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 4, 0, and 7. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <2, (6, 1, 4)>
    
For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 0, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 2. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <4, (1, 8, 2)>
    
For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 3, and 7. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <5, (9, 0, 7)>
    
For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 2, and 0. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <6, (9, 7, 2)>
    
For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 0, and 2. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <7, (5, 9, 6)>
    
For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9 and 4, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 1, and 7. Among these, we can form the following 3-stars:
    <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.
