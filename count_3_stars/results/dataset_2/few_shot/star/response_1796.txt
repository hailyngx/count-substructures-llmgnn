Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

After examining the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: nodes 4, 6, and 7. 

Let's list the 3-stars:
<4, (6, 13, 1)>
<6, (4, 13, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
