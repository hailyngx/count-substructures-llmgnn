Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying all the 3-stars. 

Here are the <unique 3-stars> found in the graph:
<0, (16, 10, 17)>
<1, (5, 13, 12)>
<1, (17, 13, 12)>
<1, (5, 13, 1)>
<1, (5, 17, 1)>
<2, (11, 10, 19)>
<3, (5, 13, 3)>
<3, (5, 13, 4)>
<4, (15, 8, 12)>
<5, (13, 1, 5)>
