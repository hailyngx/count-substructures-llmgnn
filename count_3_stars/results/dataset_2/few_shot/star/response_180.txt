Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
