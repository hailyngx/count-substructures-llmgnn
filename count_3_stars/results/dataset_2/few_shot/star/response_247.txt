Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we see that node 5, with edges to nodes 9, 0, and 3, forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 8: <9, (5, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 8: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 4: <7, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 3: <1, (4, 7, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 2: <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 1: <2, (9, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
