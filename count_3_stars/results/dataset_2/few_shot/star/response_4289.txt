Response:
The central node of a 3-star has degree 3 while the leaves have degree 1. Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 degrees: Node 11, Node 16, Node 12
<11, (16, 13, 12)>
<16, (11, 12, 17)>
<12, (11, 16, 17)>

Nodes with 1 degree: Nodes 5, 7, 10, 1, 9, 10, 9
This means none of these nodes can be part of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 3 unique 3-stars:
