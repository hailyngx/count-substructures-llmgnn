Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The potential center nodes that could form 3-stars are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 9, 10
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 13, 10

Let's find the 3-stars for each potential center:

For node 2:
- <2, (4, 9, 10)>
- <2, (4, 10, 11)>
  
For node 3:
- <3, (7, 13, 10)>
- <3, (13, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].
