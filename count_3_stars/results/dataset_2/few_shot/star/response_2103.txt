Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the possible 3-stars by examining each node's connections and finding the ones that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (3, 8, 14)>
<0, (3, 10, 11)>
<0, (8, 10, 14)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<9, (10, 11, 13)>
<10, (0, 7, 12)>
<10, (2, 9, 12)>
<10, (7, 9, 12)>
<11, (0, 6, 12)>
<11, (6, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 10, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
