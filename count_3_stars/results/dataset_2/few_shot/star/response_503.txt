Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 1)

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify and count the unique 3-stars:

<6, (7, 10, 3)>
<9, (8, 10, 7)>
<4, (5, 11, 2)>
<8, (9, 5, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 10)>
<12, (14, 0, 6)>
<2, (8, 0, 13)>
<0, (12, 2, 11)>
<5, (8, 11, 14)>
<13, (9, 2, 11)>
<11, (4, 0, 5)>
<14, (12, 3, 1)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [12]
