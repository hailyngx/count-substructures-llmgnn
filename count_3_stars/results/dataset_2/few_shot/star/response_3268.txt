Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
There is a total of [10] nodes and [40] edges in the graph.

Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- To find a 3-star, we need to locate the central node and the 3 nodes connected to it.

By examining the information provided, we identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, -)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
