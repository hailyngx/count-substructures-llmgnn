Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors, which indicates the presence of a 3-star centered at that node.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 6

For each of these central nodes, we can identify the 3-star formed by the central node and its three neighbors:
- <0, (15, 8, 6)>
- <1, (10, 11, 6)>
- <6, (10, 0, 16)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
