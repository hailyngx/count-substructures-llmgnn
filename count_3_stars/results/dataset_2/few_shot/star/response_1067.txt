Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node with 3 connected nodes, let's look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors - 9, 2, and 3
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors - 5, 8, and 0

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at nodes 5 and 3:

1. For node 5:
   - Neighbors: 9, 2, 3
   <5, (9, 2, 3)>

2. For node 3:
   - Neighbors: 5, 8, 0
   <3, (5, 8, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
