Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<1, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (8)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (4)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
