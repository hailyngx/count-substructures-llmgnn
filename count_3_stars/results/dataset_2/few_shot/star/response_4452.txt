Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: 
    - Node 0 is connected to node 15, 12
    <0, (15, 12)> is one 3-star.

2. Node 1: 
    - Node 1 is connected to node 17, 8
    <1, (17, 8)> is one 3-star.

3. Node 2: 
    - Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 14
    <2, (6, 7, 14)> is one 3-star.

4. Node 3: 
    - Node 3 is connected to node 8, 9
    There are no 3-stars with node 3 as the central node.

5. Node 4: 
    - Node 4 is connected to node 9, 16
    There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.

6. Node 5: 
    - Node 5 is connected to node 11, 18, 12
    <5, (11, 18, 12)> is one 3-star.

7. Node 6: 
    - Node 6 is connected to node 10, 17, 2
    <6, (10, 17, 2)> is one 3-star.

8. Node 7: 
    - Node 7 is connected to node 10, 11, 19
    <7, (10, 11, 19)> is one 3-star.

9. Node 8: 
    - Node 8 is connected to node 1, 14, 3
    There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the central node.

10. Node 9: 
    - Node 9 is connected to node 4, 16, 3
    There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.

11. Node 10: 
    - Node 10 is connected to node 11, 6, 7
    <10, (11, 6, 7)> is one 3-star.

12. Node 11: 
    - Node 11 is connected to node 10, 7, 5
    There are no 3-stars with node 11 as the central node.

13. Node 12: 
    - Node 12 is connected to node 13, 18, 0, 5
    <12, (13, 18, 0)> is one 3-star.

14. Node 13: 
    - Node 13 is connected to node 17, 12, 16
    There are no 3-stars with node 13 as the central node.

15. Node 14: 
    - Node 14 is connected to node 8, 19, 2
    There are no 3-stars with node 14 as the central node.

16. Node 15: 
    - Node 15 is connected to node 19, 0
    There are no 3-stars with node 15 as the central node.

17. Node 16: 
    - Node 16 is connected to node 9, 13, 4
    There are no 3-stars with node 16 as the central node.

18. Node 17: 
    - Node 17 is connected to node 1, 13, 6
    <17, (1, 13, 6)> is one 3-star.

19. Node 18: 
    - Node 18 is connected to node 8, 19, 5, 12
    <18, (8, 19, 5)> and <18, (8, 19, 12)> are two 3-stars.

20. Node 19: 
    - Node 19 is connected to node 18, 15, 7, 14
    <19, (18, 15, 7)> and <19, (18, 15, 14)> are two 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
These are: <0, (15, 12)>, <1, (17, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 14)>, <5, (11, 18, 12)>, <6, (10, 17, 2)>, <7, (10, 11, 19)>, <10, (11, 6, 7)>, <12, (13, 18, 0)>, <17, (1, 13, 6)>, <18, (8, 19, 5)>.
