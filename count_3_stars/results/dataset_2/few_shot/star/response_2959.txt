Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break down the steps:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (16, 7, 1)
   - Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 15, 6)
   - Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes (16, 13)
   - Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes (19, 8)
   - Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 17, 8, 13)
   - Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 9, 8)
   - Node 10 is connected to 2 nodes (4, 15)
   - Node 11 is connected to 3 nodes (16, 5, 4)
   - Node 12 is connected to 2 nodes (4, 9)
   - Node 13 is connected to 3 nodes (19, 2, 6)
   - Node 15 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 1, 10, 9)
   - Node 16 is connected to 3 nodes (11, 0, 2)
   - Node 17 is connected to 3 nodes (18, 6, 8)
   - Node 18 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 14, 5, 17)
   - Node 19 is connected to 3 nodes (5, 3, 13)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - <0, (16, 7, 1)>
   - <1, (0, 15, 6)>
   - <4, (11, 18, 10)>
   - <5, (11, 18, 19)>
   - <6, (1, 13, 17)>
   - <8, (7, 17, 3)>
   - <9, (7, 15, 12)>
   - <13, (19, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. Inside brackets [], we have the final count of 3-stars.
