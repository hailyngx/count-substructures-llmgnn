Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These central nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

The central nodes are: 4, 5, 12

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node to form 3-stars:

For central node 4:
Leaves: 7, 9, 13
<4, (7, 9, 13)>

For central node 5:
Leaves: 6, 13, 3
<5, (6, 13, 3)>

For central node 12:
Leaves: 6, 13, 11
<12, (6, 13, 11)>
