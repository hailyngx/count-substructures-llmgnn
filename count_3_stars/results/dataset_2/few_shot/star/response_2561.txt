Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that each node has connections to other nodes. We will now check for each node if it is the center node of a 3-star.

Following are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<11, (16, 10, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<9, (5, 4, 17)>
<10, (6, 15, 17)>
<17, (9, 10, -)>
<0, (8, 13, -)>
<1, (7, 11, -)>
<6, (10, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 0, 9)>
<12, (13, 3, 8)>
<13, (4, 0, 12)>
<14, (18, 7, -)>
<15, (19, 10, -)>
<16, (11, -, -)>
<18, (14, -, -)>
<19, (15, 7, 10)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars which is [14].
