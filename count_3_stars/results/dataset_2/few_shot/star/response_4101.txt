Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the 3-stars:
   - Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we need to look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: node 9, node 1, node 2, and node 12.
   
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each identified central node:
   - For node 9: (6, 8, 14), (7, 1, 3), (13, 11, 14), (6, 10, 11), (9, 7, 13) --> Total: 5 3-stars
   - For node 1: (10, 4, 0), (10, 6, 11) --> Total: 2 3-stars
   - For node 2: (13, 11, 14), (12, 5, 4) --> Total: 2 3-stars
   - For node 12: (5, 0, 6), (2, 4, 13) --> Total: 2 3-stars

3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - Summing up the 3-stars from each central node: 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars: 
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>
<9, (13, 11, 14)>
<9, (6, 10, 11)>
<9, (9, 7, 13)>
<1, (10, 4, 0)>
<1, (10, 6, 11)>
<2, (13, 11, 14)>
<12, (5, 0, 6)>
<12, (2, 4, 13)>
