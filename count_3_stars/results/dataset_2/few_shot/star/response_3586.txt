Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
From the adjacency lists, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<Node 0, (4, 7, 1)>
<Node 1, (8, 6, 0)>
<Node 2, (4, 8, 9)>
<Node 3, (4, 8, 6)>
<Node 4, (8, 0, 3)>
<Node 6, (1, 7, 3)>
<Node 7, (6, 2, 0)>
<Node 8, (4, 2, 9)>
<Node 9, (8, 2, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
