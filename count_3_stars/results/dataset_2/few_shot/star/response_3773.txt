Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

We have the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (9, 8, 7)>
<4, (6, 2, 1)>
<5, (8, 2, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
