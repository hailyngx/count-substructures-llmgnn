Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (8, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
