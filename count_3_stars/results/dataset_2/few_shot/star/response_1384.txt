Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking for central nodes that have exactly three leaves connected to them. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (8, 2, 0)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 2, 0)>
<6, (9)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>

Thus, there are [10] 3-stars in the graph.
