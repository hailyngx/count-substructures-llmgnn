Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 is a center with three neighbors: 15, 25, and the 3-star <1, (15, 25, 2)>
   - Node 3 is a center with three neighbors: 20, 13, and the 3-star <3, (20, 13, 9)>
   - Node 4 is a center with three neighbors: 26, 25, and the 3-star <4, (26, 25, 8)>
   - Node 6 is a center with three neighbors: 7, 24, and the 3-star <6, (7, 24, 29)>
   - Node 11 is a center with three neighbors: 0, 22, and the 3-star <11, (0, 22, 5)>
   - Node 19 is a center with three neighbors: 8, 24, and the 3-star <19, (8, 24, 29)>
   - Node 27 is a center with three neighbors: 0, 18, and the 3-star <27, (0, 18, 22)>

2. Counting the unique 3-stars we found:
   - <1, (15, 25, 2)>
   - <3, (20, 13, 9)>
   - <4, (26, 25, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 24, 29)>
   - <11, (0, 22, 5)>
   - <19, (8, 24, 29)>
   - <27, (0, 18, 22)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 7]
