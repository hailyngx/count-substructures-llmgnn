Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The possible 3-stars can be formed using each node as the central node and checking if it has exactly three neighbors. 
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each central node.

Starting with the first node:
Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, and 6. It forms one 3-star: <0, (5, 4, 3)>.

Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 3, and 2. It does not form a 3-star as it has more than three neighbors.

Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, and 3. It forms one 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 1)>.

Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 0, and 2. It does not form a 3-star as it has more than three neighbors.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 0, and 3. It does not form a 3-star as it has more than three neighbors.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 0. It forms one 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 0)>.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 0. It does not form a 3-star as it has less than three neighbors.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, and 1. It forms one 3-star: <7, (9, 4, 1)>.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected only to node 4. It does not form a 3-star as it has less than three neighbors.

Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and 7. It forms one 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 2)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
