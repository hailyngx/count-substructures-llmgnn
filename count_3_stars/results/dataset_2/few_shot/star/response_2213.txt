Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. Find all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 11
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 10, 12
   - Node 12: Connected to nodes 2, 8, 13

2. For each of these nodes, identify the possible 3-stars:
   - For Node 5:
     - <5, (6, 11)>
   - For Node 8:
     - <8, (1, 10, 12)>
   - For Node 12:
     - <12, (2, 8, 13)>

Since we found 3 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Therefore, the answer is [3].
