Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them, we first need to identify each 3-star. 

Let's start by examining each node in the graph to see if they are the center of any 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (6, 8, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 5)>, and <1, (9, 2, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 7, 5)> and <2, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars with center at node 3
- Node 4: No 3-stars with center at node 4
- Node 5: <5, (6, 4, 7)> and <5, (6, 2, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 0, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (8, 0, 5)>, <7, (8, 1, 5)>, and <7, (8, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars with center at node 8
- Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars present in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 5)>, <1, (9, 2, 5)>, <2, (9, 7, 5)>, <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <6, (9, 0, 5)>, <7, (8, 0, 5)>, <7, (8, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 2, 9)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
