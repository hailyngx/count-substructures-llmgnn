Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node of each potential 3-star.  
From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 1, 3, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be central nodes for potential 3-stars.

Step 2: Check the connections of each central node to find 3-stars.  
Let's check the connections of each central node to see if they form a 3-star structure with exactly three leaves connected to the central node.

For node 1:
- (1, 5, 12, 14, 13, 8) does not form a 3-star.
- (1, 5, 14, 13, 8) forms a 3-star. <1, (5, 14, 8)>
- (1, 5, 12, 13, 8) does not form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- (3, 5, 7, 6, 13, 8) forms a 3-star. <3, (5, 7, 6)>
- (3, 5, 13, 8) does not form a 3-star.

For node 8:
- (8, 10, 3, 14, 7, 6, 1) does not form a 3-star.
- (8, 10, 3, 14, 7, 6) forms a 3-star. <8, (10, 7, 6)>
- (8, 10, 3, 14, 7, 1) does not form a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.  
There are 2 unique 3-stars identified:
<1, (5, 14, 8)> and <3, (5, 7, 6)>
