Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by summing up the number of 3-stars centered at each node. To count the number of 3-stars centered at each node, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding the 3-stars centered at each node one by one:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 6. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 0 is <0, (8, 7, 6)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 1 is <1, (8, 4, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 18, and 4. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 2 is <2, (10, 18, 4)>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 12. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 3 is <3, (8, 7, 12)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 1. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 4 is <4, (13, 2, 1)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 11, and 18. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 5 is <5, (18, 11, 18)>.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 0, and 19. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 6 is <6, (17, 0, 19)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 7. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 7 is <7, (3, 0, 7)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 0, and 12. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 8 is <8, (13, 0, 12)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 18, 1, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 9 is <9, (18, 1, 9)>.
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 11. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 10 is <10, (11, 2, 11)>.
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 10, and 19. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 11 is <11, (16, 10, 19)>.
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 16, 8, and 15. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 12 is <12, (16, 8, 15)>.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 8, and 4. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 13 is <13, (14, 8, 4)>.
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 19, 13, and 19. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 14 is <14, (19, 13, 19)>.
16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 12, and 6. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 15 is <15, (16, 12, 6)>.
17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 15. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 16 is <16, (11, 12, 15)>.
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 17. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 17 is <17, (6, 18, 17)>.
19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 5. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 18 is <18, (17, 2, 5)>.
20. Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 6. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 19 is <19, (11, 14, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [].
