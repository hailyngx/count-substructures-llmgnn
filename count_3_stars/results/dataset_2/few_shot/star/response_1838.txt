Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's go step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, identify all the possible 3-stars:
    - For Node 0: <0, (4, 7, 3)>, <0, (4, 7, 2)>
    - For Node 1: <1, (9, 3, 6)>
    - For Node 2: <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>
    - For Node 3: <3, (9, 1, 6)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 0, 6)>, <3, (9, 0, 2)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 0, 6)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>
    - For Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>
    - For Node 5: <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>
    - For Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 3)>
    - For Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 0, 2)>
    - For Node 8: <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>
    - For Node 9: <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [17]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 17.
