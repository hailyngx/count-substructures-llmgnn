Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 5: (3, 10, 0)
- Node 10: (11, 5, 0)
- Node 13: (1, 0, 14)

2. For each of these nodes, find all possible 3-stars they are part of:
- For Node 5:
  - <5, (3, 10, 0)>
- For Node 10:
  - <10, (11, 5, 0)>
- For Node 13:
  - <13, (1, 0, 14)>

Combining all unique 3-stars found, we have:
[<5, (3, 10, 0)>, <10, (11, 5, 0)>, <13, (1, 0, 14)>]
