Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars can be formed by selecting a central node and identifying the nodes that are connected to it. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all the combinations where a central node has exactly three neighbors.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (11, 6, 12)>
<1, (16, 9, -)>
<2, (10, 5, 14)>
<3, (18, 14, -)>
<4, (12, 15, -)>
<5, (8, 2, 15)>
<6, (9, 14, 15)>
<7, (9, 17, 19)>
<8, (11, 13, 5)>
<9, (16, 6, 1)>
<10, (17, 13, -)>
<11, (16, 0, 8)>
<12, (4, 0, -)>
<13, (9, 8, 17)>
<14, (6, 2, 3)>
<15, (16, 6, 4)>
<16, (11, 1, 9)>
<17, (10, 13, 7)>
<18, (8, 3, -)>
<19, (13, 7, -)>

Now, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars. After reviewing the list, we find that there are 19 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (11, 6, 12)>
<1, (16, 9, -)>
<2, (10, 5, 14)>
<3, (18, 14, -)>
<4, (12, 15, -)>
<5, (8, 2, 15)>
<6, (9, 14, 15)>
<7, (9, 17, 19)>
<8, (11, 13, 5)>
<9, (16, 6, 1)>
<10, (17, 13, -)>
<11, (16, 0, 8)>
<12, (4, 0, -)>
<13, (9, 8, 17)>
<14, (6, 2, 3)>
<15, (16, 6, 4)>
<16, (11, 1, 9)>
<17, (10, 13, 7)>
<18, (8, 3, -)>
<19, (13, 7, -)>
