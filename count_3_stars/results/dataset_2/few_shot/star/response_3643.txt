Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

By examining the given graph, we find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
