Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by examining the adjacent nodes of each node in the graph.

Let's find the 3-stars step by step using the definition of a 3-star graph.

1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 28, 14, and 10
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 25, 5, and 29
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 13, 5, and 12
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 10, 27, and a leaf node
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 13, 12, and a leaf node
   - Node 11: Connected to nodes 16, 5, and a leaf node
   - Node 14: Connected to nodes 3, 8, and a leaf node
   - Node 15: Connected to nodes 23, 17, and 29
   - Node 17: Connected to nodes 16, 24, and a leaf node
   - Node 21: Connected to nodes 25, 10, and 15

2. Find the 3-stars for the nodes identified above:
   - <3, (28, 14, 10)>
   - <4, (25, 5, 29)>
   - <6, (13, 5, 12)>
   - <15, (23, 17, 29)>
   - <21, (25, 10, 15)>

Now, we have found all the 3-stars in the graph. Let's count them and put the final answer inside brackets.

[5]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (28, 14, 10)>
<4, (25, 5, 29)>
<6, (13, 5, 12)>
<15, (23, 17, 29)>
<21, (25, 10, 15)>
