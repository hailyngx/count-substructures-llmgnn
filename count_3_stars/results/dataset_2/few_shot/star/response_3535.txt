Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 19, and itself: <4, (7, 19, 6)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7 and 13: <5, (7, 13, 5)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 5, and 3: <7, (4, 5, 3)>
4. Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 9, 13, and 18: <14, (9, 13, 18)>
5. Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 8, 17, and 19: <16, (8, 17, 19)>
6. Node 19 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, and 17: <19, (4, 7, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
