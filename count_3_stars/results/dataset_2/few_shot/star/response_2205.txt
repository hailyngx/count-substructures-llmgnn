Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all combinations of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 5 is connected to 13, 2, and 12.
   - Node 7 is connected to 3, 0, and 13.
   - Node 8 is connected to 9, 14, and 10.
   - Node 11 is connected to 3, 1, and 6.
   - Node 12 is connected to 5, 11, and 13.
   - Node 13 is connected to 5, 7, and 12.
   - Node 14 is connected to 3, 13, and 8.

2. Combine each of these nodes with its three neighbors to form 3-stars:
   - <5, (13, 2, 12)>
   - <7, (3, 0, 13)>
   - <8, (9, 14, 10)>
   - <11, (3, 1, 6)>
   - <12, (5, 11, 13)>
   - <13, (5, 7, 12)>
   - <14, (3, 13, 8)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total number of 3-stars = 7

[Total number of 3-stars: 7]
