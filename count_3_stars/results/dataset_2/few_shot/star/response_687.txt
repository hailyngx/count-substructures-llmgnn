Let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From the edges given:
   - The possible 3-stars can be formed around nodes 3, 15, 8, 13, 2, 17, 4, 6, and 10.

- By checking the adjacency list and forming the 3-stars:
   1. Node 3: <3, (8, 19, 15)>
   2. Node 15: <15, (1, 17, 3)>
   3. Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 19)>
   4. Node 13: <13, (7, 17, 18)>
   5. Node 2: <2, (7, 14, 11)>
   6. Node 17: <17, (5, 15, 13)>
   7. Node 4: <4, (11, 12, 6)>
   8. Node 6: <6, (7, 10, 16)>
   9. Node 10: <10, (5, 14, 16)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (8, 19, 15)>, <15, (1, 17, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 19)>, <13, (7, 17, 18)>, <2, (7, 14, 11)>, <17, (5, 15, 13)>, <4, (11, 12, 6)>, <6, (7, 10, 16)>, <10, (5, 14, 16)>.
