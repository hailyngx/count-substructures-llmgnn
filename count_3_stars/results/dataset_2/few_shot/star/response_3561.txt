Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 9, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

From the given information, we see that the possible 3-stars can be formed only by the nodes that are directly connected to the central node because each 3-star has exactly 3 leaves.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars inside brackets []:
[10]
