Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 
Let's go step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify Nodes with 3 Connections
From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 1 has 3 connections: 6, 0, 10
- Node 3 has 3 connections: 14, 7, 2
- Node 4 has 2 connections: 8, 0
- Node 5 has 3 connections: 2, 8, 11
- Node 6 has 3 connections: 1, 14, 11
- Node 12 has 4 connections: 9, 8, 14, 2

### Step 2: Find 3-Stars
We can form 3-stars using the nodes with 3 connections. Let's list them:
- <1, (6, 14, 11)>
- <3, (14, 7, 2)>
- <5, (2, 8, 11)>
- <6, (1, 14, 11)>
  
### Step 3: Count the Number of 3-Stars
Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [4].
