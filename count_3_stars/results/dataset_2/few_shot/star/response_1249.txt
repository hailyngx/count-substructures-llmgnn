Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes that have exactly three neighbors. From the given adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is not a central node as it has only one neighbor.
- Node 1 is a central node.
- Node 2 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 3 is a central node.
- Node 4 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 5 is a central node.
- Node 6 is not a central node as it has only two neighbors.
- Node 7 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 8 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 9 is a central node.
- Node 10 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 11 is a central node.
- Node 12 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 13 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 14 is not a central node as it has more than three neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will start by looking at each central node and identifying the 3-stars connected to them:

- For Node 1: (1, 3, 5) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 3: (3, 1, 5) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 5: (5, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 9: (9, 13, 14) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 11: (11, 8, 12) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5)> 
<3, (1, 5)> 
<5, (1, 3)> 
<9, (13, 14)> 
<11, (8, 12)>
