Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to identify the 3-stars:

- From node 0: No 3-star found
- From node 1: <1, (4, 7, 11)>
- From node 2: No 3-star found
- From node 3: No 3-star found
- From node 4: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 15, 17)>
- From node 6: <6, (9, 12, 14)>
- From node 7: No 3-star found
- From node 8: <8, (3, 9, 18)>
- From node 9: No 3-star found
- From node 10: No 3-star found
- From node 11: No 3-star found
- From node 12: No 3-star found
- From node 13: No 3-star found
- From node 14: No 3-star found
- From node 15: No 3-star found
- From node 16: No 3-star found
- From node 17: No 3-star found
- From node 18: No 3-star found
- From node 19: No 3-star found

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 15, 17)>
