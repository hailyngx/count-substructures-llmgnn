Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 12)>
<2, (1, 18, 0)>
<3, (4, 11, 16)>
<4, (7, 19, 3)>
<5, (17, 0, 15)>
<6, (15, 13, -)>
<7, (12, 8, 13)>
<8, (11, 19, 7)>
<9, (0, 19, -)>
<10, (11, -, -)>
<11, (8, 3, 15)>
<12, (16, 14, 0)>
<13, (7, 6, -)>
<14, (1, 18, 12)>
<15, (6, 11, 5)>
<16, (18, 12, 3)>
<17, (5, -, -)>
<18, (2, 14, 16)>
<19, (9, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
