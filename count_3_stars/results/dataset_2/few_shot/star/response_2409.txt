Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the 3-stars in this graph and then we will count them:

<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (7, 0, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 0)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>

Now that we have listed all the unique 3-stars, let's count them. 
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph as listed above. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
