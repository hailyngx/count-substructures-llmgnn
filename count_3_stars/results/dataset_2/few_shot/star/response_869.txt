Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and their neighbors to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 6: <0, (5, 1, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 4: <1, (9, 6, 4)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7: <3, (5, 9, 7)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 2: <4, (5, 1, 2)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 7: <5, (4, 0, 7)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8: <6, (9, 1, 8)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 2: <7, (5, 9, 2)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 2: <8, (9, 6, 2)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 3: <9, (6, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
