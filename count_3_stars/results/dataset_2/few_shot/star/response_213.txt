Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this given graph are as follows:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
