Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected in a 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes with three connections are:
- Node 5: connected to 8, 6, 1
- Node 6: connected to 7, 13, 5
- Node 8: connected to 7, 13, 5
- Node 13: connected to 7, 8, 3
- Node 0: connected to 5, 14, 10
- Node 1: connected to 5, 2, 11
- Node 7: connected to 6, 10, 13
- Node 14: connected to 8, 0, 11
- Node 2: connected to 6, 1, 9
- Node 3: connected to 13, 9
- Node 10: connected to 7, 0, 14
- Node 12: connected to 6, 0, 14

Now, let's find the 3-stars by checking for all unique combinations where one node is the center and the other three nodes connected to it are leaves.

The 3-stars in this graph are: 
- <5, (8, 6, 1)>
- <6, (7, 13, 5)>
- <8, (7, 13, 5)>
- <13, (7, 8, 3)>
- <0, (5, 14, 10)>
- <1, (5, 2, 11)>
- <7, (6, 10, 13)>
- <14, (8, 0, 11)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
