Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars. Let's first identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 12, and 19. 
   This forms the 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 12)>
   
2. Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 19. 
   This forms the 3-star: <13, (1, 2, 19)>

Next, let's count the total number of occurrences of these 3-stars:

- <8, (6, 7, 12)> appears 1 time
- <13, (1, 2, 19)> appears 1 time

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
