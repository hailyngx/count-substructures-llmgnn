Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4: <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 3: <1, (5, 6, 3)>
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 6: <3, (5, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 1: <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 1: <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 0: <9, (6, 7, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
