Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
The 3-star structures can be found by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 1, 4)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 2, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
