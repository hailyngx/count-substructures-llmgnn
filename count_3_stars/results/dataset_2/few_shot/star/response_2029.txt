Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-star structures:

<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 4)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [10].
