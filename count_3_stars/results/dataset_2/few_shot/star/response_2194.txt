Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (8, 0, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (0, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (8, 0, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (0, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>
