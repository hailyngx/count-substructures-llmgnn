Node 11 is connected to node 16, 9, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 4, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 16, 12, 10, 15, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 18
Node 15 is connected to node 5, and node 13
Node 16 is connected to node 11, 13, 2, and node 9
Node 17 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 18 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 10, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 16)>
<3, (2, 8, 14)>
<4, (0, 11, 12)>
<5, (15, 17, 19)>
<6, (17, 19, 7)>
<7, (9, 17, 19)>
<13, (10, 15, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
