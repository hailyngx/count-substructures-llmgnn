Response:
There are several 3-stars in this graph. Let's find and count them step by step. 

Step 1: Identify the central node in each potential 3-star.
- Node 0 has neighbors 10, 11, 12, 9, and 2, forming 3-stars with (0, 10, 11) and (0, 10, 12).
- Node 1 has neighbors 7, 8, 13, and 9, forming a 3-star with (1, 7, 8).
- Node 2 has neighbors 7, 13, 6, 0, and 12, forming a 3-star with (2, 7, 13).
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 10, and 14, forming a 3-star with (3, 4, 10).
- Node 4 has neighbors 8, 9, 5, and 3, forming 3-stars with (4, 8, 9) and (4, 8, 5).
- Node 5 has neighbors 4, 6, 12, and 14, forming a 3-star with (5, 4, 6).
- Node 6 has neighbors 10, 5, and 2, forming a 3-star with (6, 10, 5).
- Node 7 has neighbors 11, 9, 2, and 1, forming a 3-star with (7, 11, 9).
- Node 8 has neighbors 4, 13, 14, 11, and 1, forming a 3-star with (8, 4, 13).
- Node 9 has neighbors 4, 7, 0, and 1, forming a 3-star with (9, 4, 7).
- Node 10 has neighbors 11, 0, 6, and 3, forming 3-stars with (10, 11, 0) and (10, 11, 6).
- Node 11 has neighbors 7, 8, 10, and 0, forming a 3-star with (11, 7, 8).
- Node 12 has neighbors 5, 0, and 2, forming a 3-star with (12, 5, 0).
- Node 13 has neighbors 8, 2, 1, and 14, forming a 3-star with (13, 8, 2).
- Node 14 has neighbors 8, 13, 5, and 3, forming a 3-star with (14, 8, 13).

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
- There are 14 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (10, 11, 12)>, <1, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (7, 13, 6)>, <3, (4, 10, 14)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 12)>, <6, (10, 5, 2)>, <7, (11, 9, 2)>, <8, (4, 13, 14)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <10, (11, 0, 6)>, <11, (7, 8, 10)>, <12, (5, 0, 2)>, <13, (8, 2, 14)>.
