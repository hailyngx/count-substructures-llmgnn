Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check its neighbors to see if a 3-star can be formed with that node as the center.
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 12, 5)>
<1, (9, 4, 14)>
<2, (10, 12, 7)>
<3, (10, 0, 9)>
<4, (12, 3, 14)>
<5, (10, 11, 0)>
<6, (10, 8, 7)>
<7, (2, 12, 6)>
<8, (11, 9, 6)>
<9, (8, 3, 1)>
<10, (11, 3, 6)>
<11, (10, 13, 5)>
<12, (10, 2, 0)>
<13, (11, 12, 3)>
<14, (4, 12, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
