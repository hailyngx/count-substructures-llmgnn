Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Based on the adjacency list, the central nodes are: 5, 2, 8, 9.

Next, for each central node, we identify the number of 3-star configurations connected to it.

For central node 5:
- <5, (1, 0, 2)>
- <5, (1, 0, 8)>
- <5, (1, 0, 9)>
- <5, (2, 0, 8)>

For central node 2:
- <2, (7, 6, 8)>
- <2, (7, 6, 5)>
- <2, (7, 1, 8)>
- <2, (7, 1, 5)>
- <2, (7, 5, 8)>
- <2, (7, 5, 0)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- <8, (4, 3, 9)>
- <8, (4, 3, 2)>
- <8, (4, 2, 9)>
- <8, (4, 2, 5)>

For central node 9:
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 5)>
- <9, (3, 8, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
