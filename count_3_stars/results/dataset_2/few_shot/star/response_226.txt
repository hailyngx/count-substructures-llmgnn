Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Given that the 3-star involves a center node and three other nodes, we can look at the adjacency list to determine the 3-stars present in the graph. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it satisfies the condition of being a center node of a 3-star.
2. For each center node, find the neighboring nodes of the center and check if they form a 3-star configuration.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the adjacency list to identify the unique 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 2)>
3. Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
5. Node 4: <4, (9, 6, 0)>
6. Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
8. Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
