Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph and then identify all instances of 3-stars in the given graph. 

A 3-star graph consists of a central node (the center) connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges. 

From the provided adjacency list, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (14, 7, 12)>
<2, (9, 3, 11)>
<4, (18, 9, 15)>
<5, (15, 3, 10)>
<7, (18, 8, 0)>
<9, (2, 4, 19)>
<10, (7, 19, 5)>
<11, (14, 2, 8)>
<12, (18, 8, 0)>
<13, (14, 17, 1)>
<14, (17, 0, 11)>
<15, (14, 4, 5)>
<16, (0, 6)>
<17, (14, 13, 19)>
<18, (4, 6, 12)>
<19, (17, 9, 10)>

Since we have found 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
