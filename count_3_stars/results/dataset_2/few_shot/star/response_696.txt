Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Okay, let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying the central nodes. From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2. For each central node, check which groups of 3 leaves are connected to it. Based on the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 2, 4)> 
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (3, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found. 
    There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
