Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star in the graph. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
3. Node 2: <2, (11, 21, 18)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it is only connected to 1 other node.
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
11. Node 10: No 3-star as it is only connected to 5 other nodes.
12. Node 11: <11, (16, 0, 2)> is a 3-star.
13. Node 12: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
14. Node 13: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
15. Node 14: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
16. Node 15: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
17. Node 16: <16, (11, 29, 8)> is a 3-star.
18. Node 17: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
19. Node 18: No 3-star as it is only connected to 5 other nodes.
20. Node 19: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
21. Node 20: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
22. Node 21: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
23. Node 22: No 3-star as it is only connected to 4 other nodes.
24. Node 23: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
25. Node 24: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
26. Node 25: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
27. Node 26: No 3-star as it is only connected to 1 other node.
28. Node 27: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
29. Node 28: No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
30. Node 29: No 3-star as it is only connected to 1 other node.

Count of 3-stars in the graph = [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (11, 21, 18)>
<11, (16, 0, 2)>
