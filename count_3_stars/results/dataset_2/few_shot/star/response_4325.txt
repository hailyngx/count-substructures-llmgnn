Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following potential 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (29, 27, 6)
2. Node 2: (29, 10, 19)
3. Node 3: (24, 23, 5)
4. Node 4: (27, 26, 8)
5. Node 5: (24, 20, 3)
6. Node 6: (17, 1, 12)
7. Node 7: (11, 28, 10)
8. Node 8: (21, 18, 4)
9. Node 9: (17, 22, 16)
10. Node 10: (11, 7, 19)
11. Node 11: (28, 26, 10)
12. Node 12: (13, 25, 6)
13. Node 13: (15, 15, 12)
14. Node 14: (17, 18, 0)
15. Node 15: (25, 28, 13)
16. Node 16: (25, 9, 16)
17. Node 17: (22, 18, 14)
18. Node 18: (17, 8, 14)
19. Node 19: (10, 2, 19)
20. Node 20: (23, 5, 20)
21. Node 21: (8, - , -)
22. Node 22: (17, 9, 0)
23. Node 23: (25, 20, 3)
24. Node 24: (5, - , -)
25. Node 25: (16, 23, 12)
26. Node 26: (4, - , -)
27. Node 27: (29, 1, 4)
28. Node 28: (15, 7, 11)
29. Node 29: (1, 27, 2)

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph would give us the answer. Let's count them.

[<1, (29, 27, 6)>, <2, (29, 10, 19)>, <3, (24, 23, 5)>, <4, (27, 26, 8)>, <5, (24, 20, 3)>, <6, (17, 1, 12)>, <7, (11, 28, 10)>, <9, (17, 22, 16)>, <10, (11, 7, 19)>, <11, (28, 26, 10)>, <12, (13, 25, 6)>, <13, (15, 13, 25)>, <14, (17, 18, 14)>, <15, (25, 15, 28)>, <16, (25, 9, 16)>, <17, (22, 17, 18)>, <18, (17, 14, 18)>, <19, (19, 10, 2)>, <20, (23, 5, 20)>, <23, (25, 23, 12)>, <27, (29, 27, 1)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
