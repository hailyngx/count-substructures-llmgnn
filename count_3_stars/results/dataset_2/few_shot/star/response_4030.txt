Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 6. Therefore, <4, (7, 6, x)> forms a 3-star.
  
2. Moving on to nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 9, 1, 0, and 3. No 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 9, 4, 1, 14, and 2. No 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 12, 0, 11, and 14. No 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 7, 2, 14, and 0. No 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 8, 2, 3, and 0. No 3-star.
  
3. Focus on the remaining nodes:
- Node 0 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 14 is not connected to exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is: <4, (7, 6, x)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
