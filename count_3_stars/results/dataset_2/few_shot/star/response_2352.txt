Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node and its adjacency list. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<3, (25, 21, 23)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>
<7, (25, 5, 24)>
<11, (21, 23, 14)>
<12, (6, 8, 29)>
<14, (5, 11, 23)>
<15, (19, 21, 17)>
<17, (6, 7, 15)>
<18, (0, 1, 12)>
<19, (26, 15, 21)>
<20, (3, 0, 22)>
<22, (3, 0, 11)>
<23, (3, 11, 14)>
<25, (3, 7, 5)>
<26, (19, 16, 4)>
<27, (1, 29, 10)>
<28, (24, 12, 8)>
<29, (8, 14, 27)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [18]
