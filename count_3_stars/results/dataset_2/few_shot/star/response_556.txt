Response:
The total number of 3-star graph configurations can be found by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 8, 7)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 17, 12)

2. Next, let's find all the 3-star configurations with the above nodes as the center:
<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<9, (4, 17, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-star graph configurations in the given graph is [2].
