The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 11, 0, 5, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 12, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 2, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 2, 8, 1, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 12, 3, 11, 5, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 14, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 4, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, 3, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<0, (7, 3, 2)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 13)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 10)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (10, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 0, 12)>
<3, (12, 4, 2)>
<3, (12, 2, 8)>
<4, (12, 10, 2)>
<5, (13, 1, 9)>
<5, (13, 9, 14)>
<5, (13, 14, 8)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
