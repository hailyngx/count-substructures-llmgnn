Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's count the number of 3-stars.

We can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them and checking if these edges form a 3-star pattern around that node.

Now, let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:
Node 0: (15, 9, 7), (15, 16, 0)
Node 2: (12, 7, 2)
Node 3: (15, 17, 3), (15, 4, 3), (15, 19, 3)
Node 4: (3, 18, 4)
Node 6: (15, 10, 6), (15, 19, 6), (15, 0, 6)
Node 7: (3, 9, 7), (3, 2, 7), (3, 0, 7)
Node 10: (17, 10, 6), (15, 10, 6)
Node 15: (10, 15, 6), (19, 15, 6), (0, 15, 6)
Node 16: (18, 16, 0)
Node 17: (10, 17, 3), (18, 17, 3)
Node 18: (17, 18, 4), (19, 18, 4), (11, 18, 4)
Node 19: (15, 19, 3), (18, 19, 4), (6, 19, 15)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (15, 9, 7)>
<0, (15, 16, 0)>
<2, (12, 7, 2)>
<3, (15, 17, 3)>
<3, (15, 4, 3)>
<3, (15, 19, 3)>
<4, (3, 18, 4)>
<6, (15, 0, 6)>
<6, (15, 10, 6)>
<6, (15, 19, 6)>
<7, (3, 0, 7)>
<7, (3, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 9, 7)>
<10, (15, 6, 10)>
<10, (17, 10, 6)>
<15, (0, 15, 6)>
<15, (10, 15, 6)>
<15, (19, 15, 6)>
<16, (0, 16, 18)>
<17, (3, 10, 17)>
<17, (4, 17, 18)>
<18, (11, 18, 4)>
<18, (17, 18, 4)>
<18, (19, 18, 4)>
<19, (3, 15, 19)>
<19, (4, 18, 19)>
<19, (6, 15, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
