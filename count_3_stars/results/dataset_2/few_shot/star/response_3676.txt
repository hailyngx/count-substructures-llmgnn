Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars in it.

First, we identify the central node for each potential 3-star. For a 3-star, the central node will have exactly three edges connecting it to the leaves.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<4, (1, 6, 11)>
<8, (5, 6, 12)>
<9, (0, 2, 12)>
<10, (0, 1, 13)>
<12, (6, 11, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we see that there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
