Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 13, 11, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 12

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (5, 7, 11)>
<7, (9, 4, 12)>
<12, (7, 2, 14)>
<6, (5, 3, 14)>
<13, (5, 0, 14)>
<0, (7, 13, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<11, (9, 7, 0)>
<10, (7, 1, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 12)>
<14, (12, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 10, 8)>
<8, (12, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15].
