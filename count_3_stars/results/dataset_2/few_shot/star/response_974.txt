Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Since a 3-star consists of one center node and three leaves, we need to find combinations of 3 nodes that form 3-stars. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that a 3-star can be formed if a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's go through the adjacency list and identify nodes that have 3 connections:

- From the list, we can see that only Node 2 has exactly 3 connections: Node 9, 0, and 7.
- So, the 3-star centered at Node 2 is <2, (9, 0, 7)>.

Now, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. Since we found 1 unique 3-star, the final answer is [1].

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is <2, (9, 0, 7)> and the total count of unique 3-stars is [1].
