Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To count the 3-stars, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star based on their connections.

List of 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (17, 19, 9)>
<2, (17, 5, 12)>
<3, (7, 12, 0)>
<7, (3, 10, 18)>
<9, (8, 1, 18)>
<11, (4, 8, 2)>
<12, (9, 2, 16)>
<13, (14, 12, 16)>
<14, (17, 8, 18)>
<19, (1, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
