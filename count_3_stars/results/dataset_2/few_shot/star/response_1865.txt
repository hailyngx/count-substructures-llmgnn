Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 12, 10, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 14, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, 13, 5, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 13, 12, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 14, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 13, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 5, 13, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 5, 12, 11, 14, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 13

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 12.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 11.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<8, (9, 1, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 0)>
<4, (8, 12, 13)>
<9, (8, 2, 14)>
<13, (4, 12, 14)>
<5, (4, 13, 12)>
<0, (1, 10, 11)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in total, so the output is [7].
