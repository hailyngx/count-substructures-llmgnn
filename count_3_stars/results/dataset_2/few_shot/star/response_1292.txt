Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is the center of a 3-star pattern, where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We will then list out the unique 3-stars we find and count them. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

**Here are the 3-stars in the graph:**
<0, (20, 28, 1)>
<2, (23, 4, 26)>
<3, (22, 8, 6)>
<5, (12, 1, 23)>
<6, (27, 18, 3)>
<9, (14, 28, 9)>
<11, (23, 24, 20)>
<12, (7, 5, 29)>
<13, (27, 17, 4)>
<16, (21, 9, 16)>
<17, (27, 14, 13)>
<18, (19, 6, 21)>
<22, (20, 24, 3)>
<23, (11, 5, 29)>
<24, (22, 11, 25)>
<25, (7, 8, 24)>
<26, (27, 4, 2)>
<27, (15, 17, 26)>
<28, (9, 16, 1)>

**Count of 3-stars in the graph: [18]** 
<0, (20, 28, 1)>, <2, (23, 4, 26)>, <3, (22, 8, 6)>, <5, (12, 1, 23)>, <6, (27, 18, 3)>, <9, (14, 28, 9)>, <11, (23, 24, 20)>, <12, (7, 5, 29)>, <13, (27, 17, 4)>, <16, (21, 9, 16)>, <17, (27, 14, 13)>, <18, (19, 6, 21)>, <22, (20, 24, 3)>, <23, (11, 5, 29)>, <24, (22, 11, 25)>, <25, (7, 8, 24)>, <26, (27, 4, 2)>, <27, (15, 17, 26)>, <28, (9, 16, 1)>
