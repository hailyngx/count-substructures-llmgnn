Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph.
Starting from each node, we will look for a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. This will indicate the presence of a 3-star with the current node as the center.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<0, (9, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
