Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will go through each node to check if it acts as the center of a 3-star.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 6, forming a 3-star with central node 0 and leaves 1, 10, and 6. <0, (1, 10, 6)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 14, but these connections do not form 3-stars.
  
Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 10, but these connections do not form 3-stars.
  
Checking Node 2:
- Node 2 is not connected to any three nodes directly, so it does not form a 3-star.
  
Inspecting Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 12, forming a 3-star with central node 3 and leaves 8, 13, and 12. <3, (8, 13, 12)>
  
Analyzing Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 4, forming a 3-star with central node 4 and leaves 10, 11, and 4. <4, (10, 11, 4)>
  
Looking at Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 0, and 14, forming a 3-star with central node 5 and leaves 12, 0, and 14. <5, (12, 0, 14)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 16, and 19, but these connections do not form 3-stars.
  
Checking Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 14, forming a 3-star with central node 6 and leaves 2, 0, and 14. <6, (2, 0, 14)>
  
Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 9, forming a 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 11, 15, and 9. <7, (11, 15, 9)>
  
Inspecting Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 12, forming a 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 3, 13, and 12. <8, (3, 13, 12)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 18, 16, and 5, but these connections do not form 3-stars.
  
Analyzing Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 7, forming a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 13, 17, and 7. <9, (13, 17, 7)>
  
Looking at Node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 4, forming a 3-star with central node 10 and leaves 1, 11, and 4. <10, (1, 11, 4)>
  
Checking Node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 7, forming a 3-star with central node 11 and leaves 10, 14, and 7. <11, (10, 14, 7)>
  
Inspecting Node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 16, and 5, forming a 3-star with central node 12 and leaves 8, 16, and 5. <12, (8, 16, 5)>
  
Analyzing Node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 9, forming a 3-star with central node 13 and leaves 8, 15, and 9. <13, (8, 15, 9)>
  
Looking at Node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 5, forming a 3-star with central node 14 and leaves 11, 6, and 5. <14, (11, 6, 5)>
  
Checking Node 15:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 7, forming a 3-star with central node 15 and leaves 13, 17, and 7. <15, (13, 17, 7)>
  
Inspecting Node 16:
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 19, forming a 3-star with central node 16 and leaves 12, 18, and 19. <16, (12, 18, 19)>
  
Analyzing Node 17:
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 9 and 15, but these connections do not form 3-stars.
  
Looking at Node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 16, and 5, forming a 3-star with central node 18 and leaves 8, 16, and 5. <18, (8, 16, 5)>
  
Checking Node 19:
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 16 and 15, but these connections do not form 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 10, 6)>, <3, (8, 13, 12)>, <4, (10, 11, 4)>, <5, (12, 0, 14)>, <6, (2, 0, 14)>, <7, (11, 15, 9)>, <8, (3, 13, 12)>, <9, (13, 17, 7)>, <10, (1, 11, 4)>, <11, (10, 14, 7)>, <12, (8, 16, 5)>, <13, (8, 15, 9)>, <14, (11, 6, 5)>, <15, (13, 17, 7)>, <16, (12, 18, 19)>, <18, (8, 16, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
