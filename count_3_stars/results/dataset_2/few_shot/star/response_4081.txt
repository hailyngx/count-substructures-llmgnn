Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-star configurations. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars: 
1. <0, (3, 8, 11)>
2. <0, (14, 16, 19)>
3. <0, (10, 16, 14)>
4. <1, (6, 11, 1)>
5. <2, (5, 16, 19)>
6. <3, (15, 5, 9)>
7. <4, (6, 16, 5)>
8. <5, (12, 2, 19)>
9. <6, (13, 1, 4)>
10. <7, (17, 18, 9)>
11. <14, (17, 0, 19)>
12. <15, (9, 3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
