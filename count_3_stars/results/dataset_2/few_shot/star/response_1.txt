Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's list each unique 3-star following the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> and then count them. 

1. <5, (4, 8, 12)>
2. <9, (5, 10, 0)>
3. <6, (3, 11, 12)>
4. <4, (5, 8, 11)>
5. <8, (5, 4, 14)>
6. <0, (9, 8, 7)>
7. <7, (0, 11, 1)>
8. <1, (7, 2, 14)>
9. <2, (0, 1, 12)>
10. <3, (6, 4, 12)>
11. <11, (6, 4, 7)>
12. <12, (5, 6, 2)>
13. <13, (3, 11, 14)>
14. <14, (8, 1, 2)>
15. <10, (9, 1, 2)>
