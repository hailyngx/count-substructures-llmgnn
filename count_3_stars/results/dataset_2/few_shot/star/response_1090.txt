Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can look for 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [10] different 3-stars in the given graph.
