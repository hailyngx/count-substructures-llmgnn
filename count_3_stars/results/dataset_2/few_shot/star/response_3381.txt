Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 1: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 2: <2, (9, 13, 19)>
Node 3: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 4: <4, (5, 13, 15)>
Node 5: <5, (9, 13, 4)>
Node 6: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 7: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 8: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 9: <9, (5, 2, 19)>
Node 10: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 11: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 12: <12, (7, 14, 15)>
Node 13: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 14: <14, (16, 12, 15)>
Node 15: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 16: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 17: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 18: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 19: <19, (11, 9, 18)>
Node 0: Not a central node for a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (9, 13, 19)>
<4, (5, 13, 15)>
<5, (9, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 19)>
<12, (7, 14, 15)>
<14, (16, 12, 15)>
<19, (11, 9, 18)>

The count of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
