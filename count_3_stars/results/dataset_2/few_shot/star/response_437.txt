Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
1. <0, (9, 7, 14)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 13)>
3. <2, (5, 4, 11)>
4. <3, (14, 6, 12)>
5. <4, (9, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (2, 8, 13)>
7. <6, (4, 7, 14)>
8. <7, (4, 10, 12)>
9. <8, (5, 9, 10)>
10. <9, (4, 0, 8)>
11. <10, (7, 11, 13)>
12. <11, (2, 10, 13)>
13. <12, (7, 10, 11)>
14. <13, (5, 10, 14)>
15. <14, (3, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
