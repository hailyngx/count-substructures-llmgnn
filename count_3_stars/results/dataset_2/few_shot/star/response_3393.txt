Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 17: <1, (7, 10, 17)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 11: <3, (1, 8, 11)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 19: <4, (9, 12, 19)>
4. Node 9 forms two 3-stars: 
    - With nodes 4, 10, and 16: <9, (4, 10, 16)>
    - With nodes 4, 9, and 19: <9, (4, 9, 19)>
5. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 10: <11, (5, 6, 10)>
6. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 19, and 15: <15, (17, 19, 15)>
7. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 13: <17, (1, 7, 13)>
8. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 14: <18, (0, 8, 14)>
9. Node 19 forms two 3-stars: 
    - With nodes 4, 10, and 15: <19, (4, 10, 15)>
    - With nodes 9, 10, and 19: <19, (9, 10, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
