Response:
Let's first identify the nodes which have exactly three neighbors. These nodes could potentially be the central node of a 3-star. We need to then check if the neighbors of these nodes form a 3-star configuration.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 7, 13, 17, 18.

After analyzing the neighbors of these nodes, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <7, (13, 0, 12)>
- <13, (12, 1, 7)>
- <17, (9, 0, _)>
- <18, (10, 6, _)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
