Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. From the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

- For Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes, so it cannot be the central node of a 3-star.
- For Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- For Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 14)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 9: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 10: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- For Node 11: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 12: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 13: <13, (0, 14, 12)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 14: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <5, (6, 7, 14)> and <13, (0, 14, 12)>.
