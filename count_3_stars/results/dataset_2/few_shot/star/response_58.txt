Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape.

From the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
