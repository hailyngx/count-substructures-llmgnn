Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 8, 6, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 10, 4, 8, 13, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 0, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 11, 2, 1, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 12, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 7, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 7, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 14, 1, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, and node 0

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
1. <2, (5, 8, 13)>
2. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <5, (2, 9, 12)>
4. <6, (1, 10, 13)>
5. <8, (1, 4, 12)>
6. <9, (5, 13, 14)>
7. <10, (4, 6, 7)>
8. <11, (1, 6, 14)>
9. <12, (5, 8, 1)>
10. <13, (2, 6, 9)>
11. <14, (0, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
