Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star.
2. For each node found as the center, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. If the above conditions are met for a center node, list the unique 3-star with the center node and leaves.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<0, (11, 8, 5)>
<1, (9, 14, 13)>
<2, (6, 11, 8)>
<3, (10, 7, 12)>
<4, (9, 14, 0)>
<5, (7, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 10, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<10, (6, 3, 13)>
<11, (14, 0, 12)>
<12, (11, 8, 3)>
<13, (9, 10, 2)>
<14, (11, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
