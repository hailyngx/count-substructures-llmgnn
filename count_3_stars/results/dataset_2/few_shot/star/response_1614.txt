Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's analyze the adjacency list:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: node 4, 8, 6, and 11.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: node 9, 13, 14, and 12.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: node 5, 9, 8, and 3.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: node 7, 2, 14, and 10.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: node 7, 8, and 0.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: node 9, 2, 8, 11, and 10.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: node 7, 14, 11, and 0.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: node 4, 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: node 5, 4, 2, 11, and 0.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: node 5, 2, 1, and 13.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: node 5, 13, and 3.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors: node 5, 8, 6, 12, and 0.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: node 13, 1, and 11.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: node 9, 12, 1, and 10.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: node 7, 1, 6, and 3.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- <5, (2, 8, 11)>
- <9, (1, 13, 5)>
- <13, (1, 9, 12)>
- <1, (9, 13, 14)>
- <7, (4, 6, 14)>
- <3, (2, 10, 14)>
- <4, (0, 8, 7)>
- <6, (0, 11, 14)>
- <0, (4, 6, 11)>
- <2, (5, 8, 3)>
- <8, (5, 0, 11)>
- <12, (1, 11, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
