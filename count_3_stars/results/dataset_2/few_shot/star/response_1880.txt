Response:
First, we need to find the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star. 
From the adjacency list:
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors

Thus, potential center nodes for 3-stars are: 13, 20, 21, and 28.

Next, we look at the neighbors of each potential center node to check if they form 3-stars. We will only consider unique 3-stars to avoid duplication.

For node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 20, 28, and 10. Therefore, <13, (20, 28, 10)> is a valid 3-star.

For node 20:
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 13. Therefore, <20, (9, 0, 13)> is a valid 3-star.

For node 21:
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 4. Therefore, <21, (0, 5, 4)> is a valid 3-star.

For node 28:
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 13. Therefore, <28, (2, 17, 13)> is a valid 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <13, (20, 28, 10)>, <20, (9, 0, 13)>, <21, (0, 5, 4)>, <28, (2, 17, 13)>.
