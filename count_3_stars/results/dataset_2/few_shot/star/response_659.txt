Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
