Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Possible 3-stars (3 nodes connected to a central node):
- <0, (5, 6, 10)>
- <1, (9, 3, 2)>
- <2, (1, 11, 4)>
- <3, (1, 0, -)>
- <4, (7, 8, 14)>
- <5, (9, 6, 10)>
- <6, (5, 9, 12)>
- <7, (4, 13, -)>
- <8, (4, 2, 12)>
- <9, (5, 6, 12)>
- <10, (5, 0, 12)>
- <11, (2, -, -)>
- <12, (9, 6, 10)>
- <13, (7, 12, 14)>
- <14, (1, 4, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [14].
