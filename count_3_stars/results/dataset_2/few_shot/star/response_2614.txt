Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Let's start by identifying such nodes and then finding the corresponding 3-stars:

1. **Identify Nodes with Exactly Three Neighbors:**
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 9
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
   - Node 0 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 9
   - Node 2 has 5 neighbors
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 6 has 5 neighbors
   - Node 8 has 6 neighbors
   - Node 9 has 6 neighbors

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - For Node 3:
     - <3, (4, 7, 8)>
   - For Node 5:
     - <5, (6, 8, 9)>
   - For Node 7:
     - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
   - For Node 1:
     - <1, (2, 6, 9)>

3. **Final Count:**
   - The unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>.
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
