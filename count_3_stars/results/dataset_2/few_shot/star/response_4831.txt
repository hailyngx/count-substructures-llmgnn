Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[6]
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
