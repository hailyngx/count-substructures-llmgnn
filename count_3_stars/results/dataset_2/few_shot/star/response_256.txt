Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
There are four possible 3-stars in this graph.

1. <0, (7, 6, 1)>
2. <2, (8, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
