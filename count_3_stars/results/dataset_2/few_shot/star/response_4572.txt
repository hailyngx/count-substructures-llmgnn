Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors are potential centers of 3-stars:
    - Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 meet this criteria.

2. For Node 2:
    - Possible 3-star centered at Node 2: <2, (9, 4, 8)>.

3. For Node 4:
    - Possible 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (9, 0, 6)>.

4. For Node 5:
    - Possible 3-star centered at Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>.

5. For Node 9:
    - Possible 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>.
