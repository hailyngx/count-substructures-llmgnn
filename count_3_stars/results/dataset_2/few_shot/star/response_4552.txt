Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with only three neighbors are: 0, 7, 10, 13. These nodes cannot form any 3-star structures since they are not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each connected node to find the 3-stars:  
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 28, and 29.  
- Node 2 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 3 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 15, and 22.  
- Node 5 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 6 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 8 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 2, and 8.  
- Node 11 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 12 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 24, and 16.  
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 22, and 4.  
- Node 16 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 19, and 14.  
- Node 18 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 19 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 20 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 21 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 22 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 23 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 24 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 25 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 26 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 27 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.  
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 13.  
- Node 29 doesn't form any 3-star since it has more than three neighbors.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:  
<1, (6, 28, 29)>  
<4, (1, 22, 15)>  
<9, (11, 2, 8)>  
<14, (17, 24, 16)>  
<15, (26, 22, 4)>  
<17, (28, 19, 14)>  
<28, (6, 1, 13)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
