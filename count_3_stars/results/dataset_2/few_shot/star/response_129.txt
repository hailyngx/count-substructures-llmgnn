Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and 7. This creates a 3-star centered at node 1. <1, (5, 4, 7)>

2. Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and 1. This creates another 3-star centered at node 5. <5, (9, 8, 1)>

3. Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and 6. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7. <7, (9, 4, 6)>

4. Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and 2. This creates a 3-star centered at node 9. <9, (8, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of four unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
