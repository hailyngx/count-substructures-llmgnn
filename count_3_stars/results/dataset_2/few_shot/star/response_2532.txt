Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph can be any node in the graph. Let's consider each node as the central node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 11, 8)>
<2, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (8, 13, 4)>
<4, (10, 13, 3)>
<5, (8, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 14, 12)>
<7, (9, 10, 0)>
<8, (5, 3, 1)>
<9, (11, 14, 7)>
<10, (11, 7, 4)>
<11, (9, 10, 1)>
<12, (6, 9, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 4)>
<14, (6, 9, 10)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
