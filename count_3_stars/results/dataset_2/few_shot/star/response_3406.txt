Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can serve as the centers of 3-stars. A center node must have exactly three neighbors since a 3-star consists of a center connected to three other nodes. 

Nodes that can be center nodes: 0, 8, 12, 17, and 19

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For center node 0:
    - <0, (11, 8, 5)>
    - <0, (11, 19, 5)>
    - <0, (11, 5, 4)>
    - <0, (8, 5, 4)>
    - <0, (5, 2, 4)>

- For center node 8:
    - <8, (16, 0, 17)>
    - <8, (16, 17, 10)>
    - <8, (16, 10, 12)>
    - <8, (17, 10, 12)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 4)>

- For center node 12:
    - <12, (10, 17, 1)>
    - <12, (10, 17, 5)>
    - <12, (10, 5, 2)>
    - <12, (17, 1, 18)>
    - <12, (17, 1, 15)>

- For center node 17:
    - <17, (8, 0, 5)>
    - <17, (8, 0, 4)>
    - <17, (8, 4, 15)>
    - <17, (0, 5, 2)>
    - <17, (0, 5, 19)>

- For center node 19:
    - <19, (10, 2, 0)>
    - <19, (10, 2, 5)>
    - <19, (10, 0, 11)>
    - <19, (2, 0, 5)>
    - <19, (2, 5, 12)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [25]
