Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to understand what constitutes a 3-star. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node and exactly three other nodes connected to it by edges.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<3, (7, 1, 10)>
<6, (3, 2, 14)>
<11, (1, 10, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars within the given graph:
