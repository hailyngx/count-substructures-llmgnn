Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<1, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 2, 0)>
<3, (7, 2, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 2, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
