Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it for each 3-star configuration. 

**Step 1:** Identify the central node:
- We will loop through each node since the central node of a 3-star can be any of the 20 nodes.

**Step 2:** Identify the leaves connected to the central node:
- For each central node, we will check its neighbors and form 3-star configurations accordingly.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (10, 14, 12)>
<1, (10, 17, 12)>
<2, (8, 13, 11)>
<3, (13)>
<4, (12, 19)>
<5, (9, 16)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (2, 13, 10)>
<9, (5, 15, 11)>
<13, (8, 17, 3)>
<14, (0, 11, 9)>
<15, (1, 11, 9)>
<16, (5, 17, 19)>
<17, (13, 1, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is **14**.
