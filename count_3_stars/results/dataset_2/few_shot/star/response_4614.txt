Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can find the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<8, (9, 1, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
