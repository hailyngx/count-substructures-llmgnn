Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's first list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (2, 1, 7)>
<9, (8, 3, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [9] unique 3-stars.
