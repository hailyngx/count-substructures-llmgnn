Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

- Node 5: <5, (9, 8, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 3, 2)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 6)>
- Node 0: <0, (4, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph: 
[8]
