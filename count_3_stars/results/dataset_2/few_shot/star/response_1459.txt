Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., form a 3-star). Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 14, 16)>
<1, (9, 14, 18)>
<2, (28, 3, 20)>
<4, (16, 23, -)>
<5, (13, 9, 27)>
<6, (19, 10, 15)>
<7, (28, 24, 10)>
<11, (9, 26, 3)>
<12, (13, 29, -)>
<17, (9, -, 14)>
<18, (22, 21, 1)>
<20, (11, 2, 1)>
<22, (27, 16, 10)>
<23, (20, 29, 4)>
<24, (21, 7, 10)>
<28, (19, 21, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
