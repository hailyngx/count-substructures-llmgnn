Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11)

Node 12 is connected to node 18, 9, 10, 11, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 18, 15, 0, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 16, 19, 7, and node 12
Node 15 is connected to node 2, 10, 6, and node 13
Node 16 is connected to node 1, and node 14
Node 17 is connected to node 2, and node 11
Node 18 is connected to node 12, and node 13
Node 19 is connected to node 4, 7, 14, and node 6

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:

<2, (8, 5, 17)>
<5, (2, 11, 7)>
<7, (5, 19, 6)>
<12, (18, 9, 10)>
<13, (18, 15, 0)>
<14, (16, 19, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
