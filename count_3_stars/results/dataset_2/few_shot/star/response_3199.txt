Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes:
   - Node 1 has degree 5
   - Node 3 has degree 4
   - Node 4 has degree 4
   - Node 6 has degree 5
   - Node 12 has degree 6
   - Node 13 has degree 5
   - Node 14 has degree 4

2. For each central node, find the nodes it is connected to:
   - For Node 1: (4, 3, 14, 12, 8)
   - For Node 3: (7, 1, 0, 6)
   - For Node 4: (9, 7, 13, 1)
   - For Node 6: (5, 3, 12, 8, 0)
   - For Node 12: (7, 1, 10, 2, 6, 8)
   - For Node 13: (4, 11, 2, 14, 0)
   - For Node 14: (7, 1, 10, 13)

3. Count the number of 3-stars with each central node:
   - For Node 1: (4, 3, 14), (4, 12, 8), (3, 14, 12) [3]
   - For Node 3: (7, 1, 0), (7, 6, 0) [2]
   - For Node 4: (9, 7, 13), (9, 13, 11), (7, 13, 11) [3]
   - For Node 6: (5, 3, 0), (5, 12, 8), (3, 12, 8) [3]
   - For Node 12: (7, 10, 2), (7, 2, 14), (10, 14, 13), (2, 14, 13) [4]
   - For Node 13: (4, 11, 2), (4, 14, 0), (11, 2, 14) [3]
   - For Node 14: (7, 10, 13) [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 3, 14)>, <1, (4, 12, 8)>, <1, (3, 14, 12)>, <3, (7, 1, 0)>, <3, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 13)>, <4, (9, 13, 11)>, <4, (7, 13, 11)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <6, (5, 12, 8)>, <6, (3, 12, 8)>, <12, (7, 10, 2)>, <12, (7, 2, 14)>, <12, (10, 14, 13)>, <12, (2, 14, 13)>, <13, (4, 11, 2)>, <13, (4, 14, 0)>, <13, (11, 2, 14)>
