Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we identify the unique 3-stars. Let's go through the steps:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 5. Thus, <0, (6, 7, 5)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 2. Thus, <1, (6, 3, 2)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3. Thus, <2, (6, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 7. Thus, <3, (9, 1, 7)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 7. Thus, <4, (9, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 2. Thus, <5, (4, 8, 2)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 0. Thus, <6, (1, 2, 0)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 4. Thus, <7, (9, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 2. Thus, <8, (9, 4, 2)> is a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 3. Thus, <9, (8, 4, 3)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
