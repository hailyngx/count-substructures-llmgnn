Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern and count them.

Here are all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (15, 27, 5)>
<15, (3, 6, 14)>
<5, (3, 0, 21)>
<6, (15, 9, 20)>
<0, (28, 5, 19)>
<27, (3, 25, 14)>
<9, (6, 20, 10)>
<19, (0, 4, 10)>
<14, (15, 27, 18)>
<16, (12, 21, 8)>
<18, (14, 11, 8)>
<20, (6, 9, 25)>
<21, (5, 16, 24)>
<25, (27, 22, 20)>
<24, (15, 25, 21)>
<4, (19, 17)>
<10, (9, 19, 1)>
<11, (18, 26, 17)>
<2, (16, 26, 1)>
