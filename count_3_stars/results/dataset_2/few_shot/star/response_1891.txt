Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<6, (9, 5, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[6]
