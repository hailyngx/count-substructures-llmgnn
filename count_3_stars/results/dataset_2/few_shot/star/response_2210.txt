Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is a central node connected to nodes 4, 3, and 5. (1, (4, 3, 5))
- Node 2 is a central node connected to nodes 7, 6, and 9. (2, (7, 6, 9))
- Node 3 is a central node connected to nodes 4, 1, and 0. (3, (4, 1, 0))
- Node 4 is a central node connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3. (4, (9, 1, 3))
- Node 5 is a central node connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6. (5, (7, 1, 6))
- Node 6 is a central node connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5. (6, (7, 9, 5))
- Node 7 is a central node connected to nodes 0, 6, and 2. (7, (0, 6, 2))
- Node 8 is a central node connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9. (8, (3, 6, 9))
- Node 9 is a central node connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. (9, (4, 6, 8))

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

<1, (4, 3, 5)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (7, 1, 6)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
