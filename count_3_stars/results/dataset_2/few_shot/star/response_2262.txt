Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (0, 17, 11)>
<3, (4, 9, 16)>
<4, (3, 7, 15)>
<6, (0, 14, 19)>
<7, (1, 4, 17)>
<8, (1, 10, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
