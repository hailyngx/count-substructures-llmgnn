Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by first identifying all possible 3-stars using the given adjacency list. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Identify all the nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 11 have exactly three neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (9, 8, 5)>
<2, (10, 11, 1)>
<5, (10, 11, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<11, (7, 10, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
