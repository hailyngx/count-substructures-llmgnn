Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Nodes with connections:  
- Node 0: {3, 5, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 11}
- Node 6: {4, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}

From the connections above, we find the 3-stars using the definition provided earlier. The 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <3, (0, 5, 11)>
2. <4, (1, 5, 11)>
3. <12, (4, 1, 6)>
4. <13, (10, 2, 8)>
5. <14, (9, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
