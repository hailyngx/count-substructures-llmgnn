Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the given adjacency list, we can see that nodes 5, 1, 7, and 8 have a degree of 4, which means they have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph and count them.
By examining the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (1, 0, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 3)>
3. <7, (5, 4, 0)>
4. <8, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, and <8, (9, 1, 3)>.
