Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is the center of a 3-star. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the center nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 9, 7, 5
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 3, 5
   - Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 8
   - Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7, 5
   - Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 7, 5
   - Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 0
   - Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 8, 4
   - Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4
   - Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 3, 0
   - Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 1
   
2. For each center node, find the 3-stars it is a part of:
   - For Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 5)>, <0, (9, 1, 5)>, <0, (7, 1, 3)>, <0, (5, 1, 3)>
   - For Node 1: <1, (9, 0, 5)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 4)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>
   - For Node 2: <2, (4, 8, 6)>
   - For Node 3: <3, (1, 7, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>
   - For Node 4: <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 0)>
   - For Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 0)>
   - For Node 6: <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 5)>
   - For Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>
   - For Node 8: <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (3, 0, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 1)>
   - For Node 9: <9, (6, 1, 0)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-star configurations:
   - Total number of 3-stars: [15]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.
