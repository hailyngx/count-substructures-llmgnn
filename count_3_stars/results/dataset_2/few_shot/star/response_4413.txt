Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the number of 3-stars.

Starting with each node as the center of the 3-star:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighboring nodes: 9, 4, and 7. 
2. Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 6, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighboring nodes: 5, 6, 3, and 8.
4. Node 3 has 5 neighboring nodes: 6, 7, 4, 2, and 8.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighboring nodes: 5, 1, 3, 7, and 0.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighboring nodes: 6, 2, 8, and 4.
7. Node 6 has 3 neighboring nodes: 5, 1, and 3.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighboring nodes: 9, 1, 3, 4, and 0.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighboring nodes: 5, 9, 3, and 2.
10. Node 9 has 3 neighboring nodes: 8, 7, and 0.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by considering each node as the center:
1. For Node 0: No 3-star can be formed.
2. For Node 1: No 3-star can be formed.
3. For Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
4. For Node 3: <3, (6, 7, 8)>
5. For Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
6. For Node 5: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
7. For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed.
8. For Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. For Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 5)>
10. For Node 9: No 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
