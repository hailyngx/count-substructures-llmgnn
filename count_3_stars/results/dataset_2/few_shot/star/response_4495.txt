Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 12, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 0, 12, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 12, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 13, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 13, 14, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 11, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 6, and node 10
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<12, (9, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
