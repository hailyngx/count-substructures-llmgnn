Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 13, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 13, 14, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 12, 14, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 12, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 10, 13, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 11, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 1, 0, 12, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 13, 5, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 8, 12, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

We find the 3-stars that satisfy the condition:
<9, (6, 11, 7)>
<11, (9, 10, 1)>
<12, (11, 13, 5)>
<13, (6, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
