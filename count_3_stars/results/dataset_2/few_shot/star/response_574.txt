Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (6, 27, 2)>
<12, (20, 21, 29)>
<13, (22, 10, 14)>
<15, (22, 20, 11)>
<17, (22, 14, 16)>
<18, (17, 9, 1)>
<22, (13, 15, 17)>
<29, (22, 24, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
