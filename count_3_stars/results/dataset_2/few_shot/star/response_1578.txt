Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central nodes:
    - Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 19), (7, 4), (9, 4), (2, 4) (7 connections)
    - Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (5, 7) (3 connections)
    - Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 13), (6, 16) (3 connections)
    - Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 2) (2 connections)
    - Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 1), (10, 14) (3 connections)
    - Node 11: (11, 17), (11, 8) (2 connections)
    - Node 12: (12, 17), (12, 2), (12, 0), (12, 18) (4 connections)
    - Node 13: (13, 6), (13, 17), (13, 14) (3 connections)
    - Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 15), (5, 14) (4 connections)

2. Identify 3-stars:
    <4, (7, 2, 9)>
    <4, (7, 2, 19)>
    <4, (7, 9, 2)>
    <4, (7, 9, 19)>
    <4, (2, 9, 19)>
    <7, (4, 5, 2)>
    <6, (1, 13, 16)>
    <10, (17, 1, 14)>
    <13, (6, 17, 14)>
    <5, (7, 8, 15)>
    
The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
