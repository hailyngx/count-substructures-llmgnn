Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (11, 8, 19)>
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: <4, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 13, 15)>
- Node 6: <6, (16, 9, 1)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 12, 19)>
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 15)>
- Node 10: <10, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 11: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 12: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 13: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 14: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 15: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 16: <16, (11, 15, 6)>
- Node 17: Not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 18: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 19: <19, (11, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (11, 8, 19)>, 
<4, (10, 13, 14)>, 
<5, (9, 13, 15)>, 
<6, (16, 9, 1)>, 
<7, (5, 12, 19)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 15)>, 
<10, (4, 7, 5)>
