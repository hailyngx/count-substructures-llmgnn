Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the information about the graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the 3-stars:

1. <0, (7, 6, 14)>
2. <1, (7, 10, 12)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 13)>
4. <3, (7, 0, 10)>
5. <4, (12, 5, 6)>
6. <5, (4, 3, 8)>
7. <6, (4, 0, 13)>
8. <7, (0, 3, 2)>
9. <8, (5, 10, 0)>
10. <9, (11, 14, 13)>
11. <10, (1, 3, 14)>
12. <11, (9, 12, 2)>
13. <12, (4, 1, 5)>
14. <13, (6, 9, 12)>
15. <14, (0, 9, 10)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
