Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 9, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 3)>
3. <2, (5, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (6, 2, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 8)>
6. <5, (6, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (5, 4, 3)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 2)>
9. <8, (4, 7, 1)>
10. <9, (4, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [10]
