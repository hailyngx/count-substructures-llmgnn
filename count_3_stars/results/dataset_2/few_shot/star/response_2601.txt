Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star based on their connections to exactly three other nodes.
- For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its three connected nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[7]
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 1, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 3)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 8, 6)>
<8, (6, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>

Final answer: [9]
