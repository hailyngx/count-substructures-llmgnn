Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration, where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<14, (0, 1, 12)>
<17, (16, 9, 19)>
<6, (3, 27, 28)>
<7, (12, 15, 8)>
<16, (17, 21, 13)>
<11, (23, 8, 15)>
<5, (19, 2, 1)>
<18, (20, 24, 19)>
<2, (16, 5, 4)>
<13, (16, 21, 29)>
<25, (26, 1, 10)>
<26, (10, 25, 4)>
<28, (3, 8, 22)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<21, (16, 13, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets:
