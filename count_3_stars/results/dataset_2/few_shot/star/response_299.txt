Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its neighbors for each 3-star in the graph. Then we will count the number of unique 3-stars.

From the given information, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<2, (18, 9, 12)>
<3, (18, 14, 13)>
<4, (19, 14, 15)>
<5, (19, 16, 14)>
<14, (4, 8, 5)>
<15, (10, 7, 11)>
<17, (19, 16, 12)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
