Response:
We can find the 3-stars by identifying nodes that are the center of a star with exactly three leaves connected to them. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 11, 13)>
<1, (17, 4, 16)>
<3, (12, 10, -)>
<6, (8, 11, -)>
<9, (5, 13, -)>
<14, (15, 10, -)>
<16, (1, 19, -)>
<18, (15, -, -)>
