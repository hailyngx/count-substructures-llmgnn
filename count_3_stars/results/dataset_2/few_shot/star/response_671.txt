Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, we will list out the nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: 6, 9, 4, 5, 8
   - Node 1: 9, 3, 4, 8, 7
   - Node 2: 6, 9, 4, 8
   - Node 3: 1, 5
   - Node 4: 9, 1, 0, 2
   - Node 5: 6, 3, 8, 0
   - Node 6: 9, 5, 2, 8, 0
   - Node 7: 1
   - Node 8: 6, 1, 5, 2, 0
   - Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 1, 0

2. Now, we will look for 3-stars by checking each node:
   - For Node 0: (6, 9, 8) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 1: (9, 3, 4) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 2: (6, 9, 4) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 4: (9, 1, 0) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 5: (6, 3, 8) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 6: (9, 5, 2) and (9, 8, 0) are 3-stars.
   - For Node 8: (6, 1, 5) and (6, 2, 0) are 3-stars.
   - For Node 9: (6, 4, 2) is a 3-star.

3. List the unique 3-stars: 
   - <<0, (6, 9, 8)>>, <<1, (9, 3, 4)>>, <<2, (6, 9, 4)>>, <<4, (9, 1, 0)>>, <<5, (6, 3, 8)>>, <<6, (9, 5, 2)>>, <<6, (9, 8, 0)>>, <<8, (6, 1, 5)>>, <<8, (6, 2, 0)>>, <<9, (6, 4, 2)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
