Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 7
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 13
- Node 19

Now, let's evaluate the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it only has one neighbor.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed since it only has one neighbor.
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed since it only has one neighbor.
- Node 13: No 3-star can be formed since it only has one neighbor.
- Node 19: No 3-star can be formed since it only has three neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

<0, (1, 11, 19)>, <11, (2, 8, 19)>, <15, (5, 14, 16)>, <16, (2, 5, 18)>, <19, (1, 3, 11)>
