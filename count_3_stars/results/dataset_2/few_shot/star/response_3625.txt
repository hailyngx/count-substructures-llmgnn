Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the nodes with degree 3 are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 14. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (7, 14, 9)>
- From node 1: <1, (7, 10, 14)>
- From node 2: <2, (11, 0, 12)>
- From node 5: <5, (10, 6, 13)>
- From node 6: <6, (4, 7, 10)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 11, 0)>
- From node 10: <10, (4, 6, 1)>
- From node 11: <11, (4, 9, 6)>
- From node 14: <14, (0, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9. 

So, the final answer is [9].
