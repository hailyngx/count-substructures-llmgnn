Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 4, 6)>
<15, (3, 4, 29)>
<4, (15, 11, 29)>
<6, (4, 16, 29)>
<7, (11, 24, 2)>
<20, (25, 26, 8)>
<21, (18, 22, 26)>
<22, (0, 29, 8)>
<23, (11, 14, 1)>
<25, (20, 5, 10)>
<26, (20, 21, 27)>
<27, (16, 26, 28)>
<28, (20, 14, 17)>
<29, (4, 22, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
