Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 10, 8, 12, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 14, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 10, 4, 8, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 13, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 12, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 5, and node 14

Node 10 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 9, 11, 5, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 8, 7, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-stars we find:

<1, (4, 13, 14)>
<3, (0, 5, 11)>
<7, (11, 14, 5)>
<10, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 12)>
<0, (3, 8, 10)>
<13, (0, 2, 14)>
<2, (4, 8, 10)>
<12, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 9, 13)>

Counting each unique 3-star once, we get a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
