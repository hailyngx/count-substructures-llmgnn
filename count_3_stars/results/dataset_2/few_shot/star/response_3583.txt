Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 6) (17, 3) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16)

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (10, 11, 15)>
2. <8, (4, 14, 5)>
3. <12, (3, 14, 16)>
4. <14, (2, 8, 19)>
5. <18, (11, 16, 19)>
6. <19, (4, 14, 18)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
