Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<6, (7, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 8, 4)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
