Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
The center nodes for potential 3-stars can be any node in the graph. To find the 3-stars, we need to check each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form a 3-star pattern.

Checking for 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (9, 3, 14), (2, 13, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 13, 12), (4)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 0, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 13, 12), (11, 7, 0)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2), No 3-star found>
- Node 5: <5, (10, 8, 12), No 3-star found>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 13), (10)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 10, 3), No 3-star found>
- Node 8: <8, (11, 14, 12), No 3-star found>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 12), (0, 11, 13)>
- Node 10: <10, (6, 11, 5), (7)>
- Node 11: <11, (9, 10, 12), (3, 8)>
- Node 12: <12, (9, 1, 5), (3, 8, 11)>
- Node 13: <13, (6, 1, 0), (3)>
- Node 14: <14, (8, 0), No 3-star found>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (9, 3, 14)> <0, (2, 13, 9)> <1, (3, 13, 12)> <2, (9, 0, 4)> <3, (1, 13, 12)> <3, (11, 7, 0)> <6, (9, 7, 13)>
