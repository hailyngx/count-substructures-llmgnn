Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that some nodes have exactly three connections. These nodes can potentially be the central nodes (centers) of 3-stars. Let's list them:
1. Node 5 with connections to node 18, 12, and 0
2. Node 6 with connections to node 4, 3, and 16
3. Node 8 with connections to node 9, 10, and 16

Now, for each of these potential center nodes, let's check if their connections form 3-stars. If they do, we will list them:
1. For Node 5:
   - <5, (18, 0, 12)>
   - <5, (3, 6, 19)>
   
2. For Node 6:
   - <6, (4, 16, 19)>
   
3. For Node 8:
   - <8, (9, 10, 16)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
