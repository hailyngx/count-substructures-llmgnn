Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 13)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 7, 14, 0)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 7, 11, 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 7, 0, 10)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 10, 6, 12)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 4, 8, 13)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 1, 11, 13)

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 13)>
<1, (7, 14, 0)>
<2, (7, 11, 0)>
<3, (7, 0, 10)>
<8, (10, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 8, 13)>
<14, (1, 11, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
