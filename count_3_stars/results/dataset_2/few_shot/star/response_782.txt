Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each central node and its three connected nodes. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. For each node in the graph, check if it can form a 3-star. A 3-star can be formed if a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1: (1, 2, 10), (1, 2, 11), (1, 4, 11), (1, 10, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 11), (2, 1, 14)
- Node 5: (5, 3, 7), (5, 6, 12), (5, 8, 14)
- Node 6: (6, 4, 11)
- Node 7: (7, 3, 12), (7, 9, 12)
- Node 8: (8, 5, 10), (8, 9, 14)
- Node 9: (9, 4, 10), (9, 4, 11) 
- Node 11: (11, 0, 13), (11, 2, 14)

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 10, 11)>
<2, (1, 11, 14)>
<5, (3, 7, 12)>
<5, (6, 12, 8)>
<6, (4, 11, 5)>
<7, (3, 12, 9)>
<8, (5, 10, 8)>
<8, (9, 14, 8)>
<9, (4, 10, 9)>
<9, (4, 11, 9)>
<11, (0, 11, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
