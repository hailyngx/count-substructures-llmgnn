Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.  
   - Nodes 15, 6, 9, 0, and 2 have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

2. For each potential center node, identify the nodes connected to it. These connected nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.
   - For node 15: Nodes 3, 1, 24
   - For node 6: Nodes 9, 11, 8
   - For node 9: Nodes 6, 21, 7
   - For node 0: Nodes 14, 11, 4
   - For node 2: Nodes 14, 22, 19
   
Constructing the 3-stars:  
- <15, (3, 1, 24)>
- <6, (9, 11, 8)>
- <9, (6, 21, 7)>
- <0, (14, 11, 4)>
- <2, (14, 22, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
