Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 3, 2)>
2. Node 1: <1, (6, 9, 3)>
3. Node 2: <2, (6, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3: None (Connected to only two nodes)
5. Node 4: None (Connected to more than three nodes)
6. Node 5: None (Connected to only two nodes)
7. Node 6: None (Connected to only two nodes)
8. Node 7: <7, (2, 11, 14)>
9. Node 8: None (Connected to more than three nodes)
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 1, 11)>
11. Node 10: <10, (3, 13, 12)>
12. Node 11: <11, (9, 4, 7)>
13. Node 12: None (Connected to more than three nodes)
14. Node 13: None (Connected to only three nodes)
15. Node 14: <14, (1, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 11, 14)>, <9, (6, 1, 11)>, <10, (3, 13, 12)>, and <11, (9, 4, 7)>.
