Response:
Let's start counting the 3-stars in the given graph by inspecting each node's connections.

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 12, 11), (0, 5) - No 3-star
2. Node 1: (1, 8, 14), (1, 13), (1, 10) - No 3-star
3. Node 2: (2, 8, 12), (2, 14) - No 3-star
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 14), (3, 10, 13) - No 3-star
5. Node 4: (4, 6, 7), (4, 8, 3) - <4, (6, 7)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0) - No 3-star
7. Node 6: (6, 9, 7), (6, 11, 4), (6, 13) - <6, (9, 7, 11)>
8. Node 7: (7, 6, 4), (7, 11, 13) - No 3-star
9. Node 8: (8, 9, 4), (8, 2, 14), (8, 1) - No 3-star
10. Node 9: (9, 6, 8), (9, 11, 10), (9, 12) - <9, (6, 8, 11)>
11. Node 10: (10, 9, 3), (10, 1) - No 3-star
12. Node 11: (11, 6, 9), (11, 7, 12), (11, 0) - <11, (6, 9, 7)>
13. Node 12: (12, 9, 2), (12, 0, 11) - No 3-star
14. Node 13: (13, 6, 7), (13, 3, 1) - No 3-star
15. Node 14: (14, 8, 2), (14, 1, 3) - No 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <4, (6, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 11)>, <9, (6, 8, 11)>, and <11, (6, 9, 7)>.  
Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
