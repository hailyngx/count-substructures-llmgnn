Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 16) - <5, (6, 10, 16)>
2. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 2) - <6, (5, 9, 2)>
3. Node 10: (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 13) - <10, (5, 9, 13)>
4. Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 17), (13, 2) - <13, (10, 17, 2)>
5. Node 16: (16, 1), (16, 5), (16, 15) - <16, (1, 5, 15)>
6. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 17), (7, 11) - <7, (1, 17, 11)>
7. Node 15: (15, 8), (15, 16), (15, 19) - <15, (8, 16, 19)>
8. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 19) - <2, (6, 8, 19)>
9. Node 4: (4, 17), (4, 11), (4, 2) - <4, (17, 11, 2)>
10. Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 7), (11, 4) - <11, (1, 7, 4)>
11. Node 18: (18, 13), (18, 7), (18, 0) - <18, (13, 7, 0)>

There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
