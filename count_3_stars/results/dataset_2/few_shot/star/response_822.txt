Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that each node has at least one connection to another node.

- For each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes. This means the node will be the central node, and the three connected nodes will be the leaves.

- We will identify and count all unique 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<13, (4, 10, 16)>
<22, (5, 10, 25)>
<20, (7, 11, 25)>
<25, (2, 5, 23)>
<4, (6, 9, 13)>
<9, (1, 4, 16)>
<10, (13, 22, 29)>
<6, (4, 6, 23)>
<7, (20, 28, 7)>
<8, (8, 17, 24)>
<12, (18, 19, 29)>
<11, (2, 9, 20)>
<14, (16, 19, 28)>
<15, (21, 28, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
