Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 0:
    <0, (6, 9, 5)>
    <0, (6, 3, 5)>
    Total: 2

2. For node 1:
    No 3-star with node 1 as the center.

3. For node 2:
    No 3-star with node 2 as the center.

4. For node 3:
    <3, (4, 7, 10)>
    Total: 1

5. For node 4:
    <4, (6, 7, 14)>
    Total: 1

6. For node 5:
    No 3-star with node 5 as the center.

7. For node 6:
    <6, (9, 14, 7)>
    <6, (9, 4, 0)>
    Total: 2

8. For node 7:
    No 3-star with node 7 as the center.

9. For node 8:
    No 3-star with node 8 as the center.

10. For node 9:
    <9, (6, 14, 10)>
    Total: 1

11. For node 10:
    No 3-star with node 10 as the center.

12. For node 11:
    No 3-star with node 11 as the center.

13. For node 12:
    No 3-star with node 12 as the center.

14. For node 13:
    No 3-star with node 13 as the center.

15. For node 14:
    <14, (6, 9, 4)>
    Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 9, 5)>, <0, (6, 3, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 10)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <6, (9, 14, 7)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 14, 10)>, <14, (6, 9, 4)>.
