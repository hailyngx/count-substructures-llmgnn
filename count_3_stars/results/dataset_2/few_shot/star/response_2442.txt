Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, let's identify the center nodes and their neighboring nodes to find the 3-stars. Once we find all the 3-stars, we will count the total number. 

The center nodes and their neighboring nodes for the given graph are:
- Center node 0 with neighboring nodes 27, 22, 18
- Center node 1 with neighboring nodes 11, 13, 9
- Center node 2 with neighboring nodes 3, 14
- Center node 3 with neighboring nodes 2, 28
- Center node 4 with neighboring nodes 17, 8, 13
- Center node 5 with neighboring nodes 8, 6, 22
- Center node 6 with neighboring nodes 5, 15
- Center node 7 with neighboring nodes 29, 8, 11
- Center node 8 with neighboring nodes 0, 4, 9
- Center node 9 with neighboring nodes 27, 1, 8
- Center node 10 with neighboring nodes 17, 24, 16
- Center node 11 with neighboring nodes 29, 1, 26
- Center node 12 with neighboring nodes 15
- Center node 13 with neighboring nodes 1, 4, 20
- Center node 14 with neighboring nodes 2, 9, 18
- Center node 15 with neighboring nodes 6, 20, 23
- Center node 16 with neighboring nodes 10, 28
- Center node 17 with neighboring nodes 27, 10, 4
- Center node 18 with neighboring nodes 0, 29, 14
- Center node 19 with neighboring nodes 20, 21
- Center node 20 with neighboring nodes 15, 13, 19
- Center node 21 with neighboring nodes 27, 19, 23
- Center node 22 with neighboring nodes 0, 5, 26
- Center node 23 with neighboring nodes 15, 7, 21
- Center node 24 with neighboring nodes 10, 28
- Center node 26 with neighboring nodes 22, 11
- Center node 27 with neighboring nodes 0, 21, 17
- Center node 28 with neighboring nodes 3, 5, 16
- Center node 29 with neighboring nodes 7, 11, 18

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars. 

[<0, (27, 22, 18)>, <27, (21, 17, 9)>, <2, (3, 14, 28)>, <4, (17, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 22, 28)>, <8, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 14)>, <10, (24, 16, 17)>, <11, (29, 1, 26)>, <13, (1, 4, 20)>, <15, (6, 20, 23)>, <16, (10, 28, 24)>, <18, (29, 14, 0)>, <20, (13, 15, 19)>, <21, (27, 19, 23)>, <22, (26, 0, 5)>, <23, (13, 15, 7)>, <24, (10, 16, 28)>, <26, (11, 22, 0)>, <28, (3, 5, 16)>, <29, (18, 11, 7)>]

[<0, (27, 22, 18)>, <27, (21, 17, 9)>, <2, (3, 14, 28)>, <4, (17, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 22, 28)>, <8, (4, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 14)>, <10, (24, 16, 17)>, <11, (29, 1, 26)>, <13, (1, 4, 20)>, <15, (6, 20, 23)>, <16, (10, 28, 24)>, <18, (29, 14, 0)>, <20, (13, 15, 19)>, <21, (27, 19, 23)>, <22, (26, 0, 5)>, <23, (13, 15, 7)>, <24, (10, 16, 28)>, <26, (11, 22, 0)>, <28, (3, 5, 16)>, <29, (18, 11, 7)>]

With a total count of [21].
