Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 10. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 6, and 10 as leaves. <1, (3, 6, 10)>

2. Similarly, Node 2 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 19. This forms a 3-star with Node 2 as the center and nodes 17, 10, and 19 as leaves. <2, (17, 10, 19)>

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 11. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 15, and 11 as leaves. <6, (1, 15, 11)>

4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 11. This forms a 3-star with Node 13 as the center and nodes 9, 17, and 11 as leaves. <13, (9, 17, 11)>

5. Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 17, and 6. This forms a 3-star with Node 15 as the center and nodes 18, 17, and 6 as leaves. <15, (18, 17, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
