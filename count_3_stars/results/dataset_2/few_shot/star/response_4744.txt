Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star structure. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<3, (15, 7, 16)>
<3, (15, 9, 2)>
<3, (15, 10, 16)>
<3, (15, 10, 17)>
<3, (15, 10, 5)>
<3, (15, 16, 19)>
<3, (3, 15, 7)>
<3, (3, 15, 16)>
<3, (3, 15, 9)>
<3, (3, 15, 2)>
<3, (3, 7, 14)>
<3, (3, 7, 14)>
<3, (3, 16, 19)>
<3, (9, 6, 13)>
<3, (9, 6, 13)>
<3, (9, 6, 17)>
<3, (5, 10, 18)>
<3, (5, 10, 17)>
<3, (14, 7, 17)>
<3, (11, 5, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
