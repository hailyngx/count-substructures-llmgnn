Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors (degree 3). These nodes will act as the center of a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 27, and 8.
- Node 9 has neighbors 26, 18, and 2.
- Node 21 has neighbors 9, 3, and 10.
- Node 26 has neighbors 9, 22, and 24.
- Node 29 has neighbors 8, 17, and 22.

2. For each of these nodes, identify the 3-stars by checking which nodes are connected to the central node and do not have an edge between them.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (9, 27, 8)>
<9, (26, 18, 2)>
<21, (3, 9, 10)>
<26, (24, 9, 22)>
<29, (17, 8, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
