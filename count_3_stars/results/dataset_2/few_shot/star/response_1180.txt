Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<15, (27, 12, 24)>
<27, (15, 12, 26)>
<4, (7, 18, 25)>
<7, (4, 20, 28)>
<18, (4, 14, 16)>
<21, (15, 28, 10)>
<28, (7, 18, 21)>
<1, (13, 8, 11)>
<14, (18, 0, 25)>
<23, (7, 17, 1)>
<5, (23, 29, 5)>
<20, (7, 28, 24)>
<25, (4, 14, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13] when considering uniqueness.
