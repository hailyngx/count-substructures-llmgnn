Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

From the given graph, the 3-star structures can be identified as follows:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>

Thus, we have found 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
