Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list provided, we can see the relationships between the nodes. For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars we can find in this graph:
<0, (9, 6, 27)>
<4, (7, 28, 16)>
<5, (22, 19, 10)>
<6, (9, 0, 3)>
<10, (26, 14, 20)>
<12, (18, 23, 15)>
<13, (26, 29, 1)>
<14, (22, 28, 10)>
<15, (0, 6, 4)>
<17, (1, 8, 21)>
<18, (20, 12, 25)>
<23, (7, 13, 11)>
<25, (18, 11, 24)>
<26, (13, 29, 10)>
<27, (0, 11, 3)>
<28, (4, 14, 22)>
<29, (13, 20, 8)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
