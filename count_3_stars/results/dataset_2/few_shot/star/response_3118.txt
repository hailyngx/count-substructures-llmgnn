Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 11, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, 13, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, 3, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 14, 11, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 13, 14, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, 2, 1, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 14, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 2, 0, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 11, 3, and node 9

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (12, 13, 14)>
<5, (6, 13, 1)>
<6, (4, 5, 10)>
<2, (5, 6, 10)>
<8, (7, 14, 12)>
<0, (14, 11, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 13)>
<3, (2, 14, 11)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
