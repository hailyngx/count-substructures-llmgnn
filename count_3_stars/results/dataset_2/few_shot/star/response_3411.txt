Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6 <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars with nodes 4, 1, and 8 <3, (1, 4, 8)> and nodes 4, 5, and 14 <3, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 11 <9, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 12 <10, (9, 11, 12)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 10 <11, (7, 3, 10)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 5 <12, (10, 11, 5)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9 <13, (1, 5, 9)>

Total Number of 3-stars: 7
