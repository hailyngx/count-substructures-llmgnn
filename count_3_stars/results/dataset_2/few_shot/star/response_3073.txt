Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 0

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for every possible 3-star configuration and see how many instances of each configuration exist.

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:
1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
8. <7, (5, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now let's count the occurrences of each unique 3-star configuration:
1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>: 1
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>: 2
3. <2, (4, 5, 8)>: 1
4. <3, (0, 1, 9)>: 1
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>: 1
6. <5, (2, 7, 9)>: 1
7. <6, (0, 1, 4)>: 1
8. <7, (5, 8, 9)>: 1
9. <8, (2, 3, 5)>: 1
10. <9, (1, 3, 5)>: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
