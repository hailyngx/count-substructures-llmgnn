Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - From the adjacency list, the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
     - Node 3: connected to nodes 5, 13, and 10
     - Node 4: connected to nodes 13, 1, and 10
     - Node 5: connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3
     - Node 8: connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
     - Node 9: connected to nodes 14, 10, and 7
     - Node 10: connected to nodes 2, 0, and 3

2. Construct the 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center:
   - For Node 3:
     - <3, (5, 13, 10)>
   - For Node 4:
     - <4, (13, 1, 10)>
   - For Node 5:
     - <5, (6, 8, 3)>
   - For Node 8:
     - <8, (5, 6, 2)>
   - For Node 9:
     - <9, (14, 10, 7)>
   - For Node 10:
     - <10, (2, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
