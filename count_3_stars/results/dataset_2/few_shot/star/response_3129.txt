Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-stars:
<1, (13, 29, 4)>
<4, (13, 1, 11)>
<6, (0, 15, 17)>
<10, (13, 21, 27)>
<13, (1, 10, 21)>
<17, (6, 13, 16)>
<21, (10, 13, 23)>
<24, (0, 22, 20)>
<25, (0, 11, 27)>
<26, (6, 29, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
