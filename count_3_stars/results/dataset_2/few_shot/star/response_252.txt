Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
I will count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node to find the 3-stars.

Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 6: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 7: <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
Total number of 3-stars: [15]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
