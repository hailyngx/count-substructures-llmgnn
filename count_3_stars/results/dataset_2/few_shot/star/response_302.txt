Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
1. Calculate the degree of each node. 
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 3
   - Node 3: degree 2
   - Node 4: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 5
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 5
   - Node 8: degree 6
   - Node 9: degree 4

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - Node 5 forms three 3-stars: <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>
   - Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (5, 4, 0)>
   - Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (9, 3, 1)>
   
3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [5]
