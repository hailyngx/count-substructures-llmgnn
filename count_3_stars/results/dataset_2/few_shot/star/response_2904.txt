Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <18, (22, 11, 20)>
2. <22, (18, 19, 0)>
3. <4, (8, 10, 5)>
4. <8, (4, 24, 11)>
5. <0, (22, 14, 23)>
6. <21, (28, 27, 25)>
7. <28, (21, 11, 27)>
8. <1, (15, 20, 10)>
9. <15, (21, 1, 23)>
10. <3, (20)>
11. <17, (22, 5)>
12. <25, (21, 10, 2)>
13. <19, (22, 2, 10)>
14. <5, (4, 17, 7)>
