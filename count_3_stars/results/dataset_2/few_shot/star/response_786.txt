Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (1, 7, 11)>
<5, (4, 5, 16)>
<7, (7, 0, 18)>
<11, (6, 10, 17)>
<13, (2, 13, 14)>
<16, (0, 16, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
