Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it is the central node of a 3-star:

- Node 0 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms the 3-star <1, (13, 4, 14)>.
- Node 2 forms the 3-stars <2, (13, 18, 5)> and <2, (13, 5, 6)>.
- Node 3 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms the 3-star <5, (2, 4, 0)>.
- Node 6 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 9 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 10 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 11 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 12 forms the 3-star <12, (11, 18, 1)>.
- Node 13 forms the 3-star <13, (17, 16, 2)>.
- Node 14 forms the 3-stars <14, (10, 2, 7)> and <14, (10, 1, 7)>.
- Node 15 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 16 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 17 forms the 3-star <17, (8, 13, 4)>.
- Node 18 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 19 is not a central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (13, 4, 14)>, <2, (13, 18, 5)>, <2, (13, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 0)>, <12, (11, 18, 1)>, <13, (17, 16, 2)>, <14, (10, 2, 7)>, and <17, (8, 13, 4)>.
