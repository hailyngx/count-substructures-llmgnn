Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. 
Based on the adjacency list of each node and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 2, 3)>
<0, (11, 2, 8)>
<0, (11, 3, 14)>
<0, (11, 3, 0)>
<0, (2, 5, 10)>
<0, (2, 5, 13)>
<0, (2, 10, 14)>
<0, (3, 9, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 12)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 12, 5)>
<0, (3, 12, 10)>
<0, (3, 12, 4)>
<0, (3, 12, 3)>
<1, (11, 10, 13)>
<1, (11, 0, 8)>
<1, (11, 0, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 12, 10)>
<2, (10, 11, 1)>
<2, (10, 11, 0)>
<2, (10, 11, 3)>
<2, (10, 11, 14)>
<2, (13, 4, 6)>
<2, (13, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 5, 2)>
<3, (9, 5, 12)>
<3, (9, 12, 10)>
<3, (4, 13, 6)>
<3, (4, 13, 8)>
<4, (13, 10, 2)>
<4, (13, 10, 14)>
<5, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (12, 10, 14)>
<6, (13, 10, 2)>
<7, (9, 3, 12)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33]. 
Unique 3-stars: <0, (11, 2, 3)>, <0, (11, 2, 8)>, <0, (11, 3, 14)>, <0, (11, 3, 0)>, <0, (2, 5, 10)>, <0, (2, 5, 13)>, <0, (2, 10, 14)>, <0, (3, 9, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 12)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 12, 5)>, <0, (3, 12, 10)>, <0, (3, 12, 4)>, <0, (3, 12, 3)>,...
