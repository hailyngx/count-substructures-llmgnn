Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1)

Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly three edges (leaves) connected to them. Let's go step-by-step:

1.  Identify nodes with exactly three edges (leaves) connected to them:
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it: 9, 5, 7, and 0
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it: 6 and 8
- Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it: 6, 2, 3, and 1
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected to it: 0, 8, 3, and 4
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to it: 5, 2, 7, and 3
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it: 6, 8, 3, and 1

2.  Form 3-stars for each node by considering it as the center node:
- For Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>
- For Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- For Node 0: <0, (6, 2, 3)>, <0, (6, 3, 1)>, <0, (2, 3, 1)>
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 4)>
- For Node 8: <8, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 3)>
- For Node 7: <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>

3.  Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]
4.  List the unique 3-stars: 
- <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <0, (6, 2, 3)>, <0, (6, 3, 1)>, <0, (2, 3, 1)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 4)>, <8, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)> 

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
