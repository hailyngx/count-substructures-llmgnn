Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the graph:

<10, (14, 8, 19)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 14, 6)>
<8, (4, 10, 3)>
<9, (4, 11, 19)>
<14, (5, 18, 10)>
<0, (12, 13, 19)>
<11, (5, 18, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<3, (8, 12, 9)>
<1, (6, 16, 5)>
<18, (11, 3, 14)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [12].
