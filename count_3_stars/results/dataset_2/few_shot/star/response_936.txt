Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking at each node and its connections. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 2, and 7. Since Node 0 is connected to exactly 4 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 0, and 8. Since Node 1 is connected to exactly 4 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 0, and 7. Since Node 2 is connected to exactly 4 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 7, and 2. Node 3 forms the following 3-stars:
     - <3, (5, 9, 1)>
     - <3, (5, 7, 2)>

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 0, and 2. Node 4 forms the following 3-star:
     - <4, (5, 9, 6)>

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, 4, 3, and 7. Node 5 forms the following 3-stars:
     - <5, (9, 6, 1)>
     - <5, (4, 3, 7)>

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 4. Since Node 6 is connected to exactly 2 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 8, 0, and 2. Node 7 forms the following 3-star:
     - <7, (5, 3, 8)>

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. Since Node 8 is connected to exactly 2 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3. Since Node 9 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it forms a 3-star:
      - <9, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. These 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>.
