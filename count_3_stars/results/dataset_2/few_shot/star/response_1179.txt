Node 19 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 12

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes with three connections:
- Node 8: connected to nodes 6, 7, and 19
- Node 9: connected to nodes 18, 17, and 10
- Node 11: connected to nodes 6, 0, and 1
- Node 16: connected to nodes 12, 1, and 3

Step 2: Determine the number of 3-stars originating from each of these nodes.

For Node 8:
<8, (6, 7, 19)>
<8, (6, 7, 14)>

For Node 9:
<9, (18, 17, 10)>

For Node 11:
<11, (6, 0, 1)>

For Node 16:
<16, (12, 1, 3)>
<16, (12, 1, 18)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
