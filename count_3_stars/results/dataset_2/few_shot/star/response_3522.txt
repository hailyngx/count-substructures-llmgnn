Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, as those nodes can be the centers of 3-stars.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 11 <5, (6, 1, 11)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 2 <6, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 3 <8, (6, 12, 3)>
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, 8 <12, (9, 11, 8)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 0 <13, (4, 6, 0)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <5, (6, 1, 11)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (6, 12, 3)>, <12, (9, 11, 8)>, <13, (4, 6, 0)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
