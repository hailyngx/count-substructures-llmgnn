Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (6, 9, 1)>
- From node 1: <1, (3, 2, 5)>
- From node 2: <2, (9, 1, 3)>
- From node 3: <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 0, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- From node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it only has one edge.
- From node 7: <7, (3, 0, 2)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 7, 2)>
- From node 9: <9, (8, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
