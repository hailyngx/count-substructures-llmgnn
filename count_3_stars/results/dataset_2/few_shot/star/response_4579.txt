Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-star structures:

<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<7, (9, 2, 0)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>

Counting all the identified 3-stars, we find a total of 9 such structures.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
