Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with three edges. These are nodes: 1, 4, 8, and 13.

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- For node 1: Leaves are nodes 2, 10, and 14.
- For node 4: Leaves are nodes 0, 9, and 14.
- For node 8: Leaves are nodes 6, 12, and 13.
- For node 13: Leaves are nodes 5, 7, and 11.

Finally, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 10, 14)>
- <4, (0, 9, 14)>
- <8, (6, 12, 13)>
- <13, (5, 7, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
