Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are forming 3-stars with other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 3. <5, (6, 4, 3)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 0, and 3. <1, (6, 0, 3)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 7. <8, (5, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
