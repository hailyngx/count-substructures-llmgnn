Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and count the 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
    - Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 9 has 1 neighbor.
    - Node 14 has 2 neighbors.
    These nodes cannot be the central nodes of 3-stars.

2. Nodes with 3 neighbors:
    - Node 0: <0, (5, 13, 14)>, <0, (12, 13, 14)>
    - Node 2: <2, (10, 8, 13)>
    - Node 3: <3, (7, 10, 11)>, <3, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>
    - Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 7)>
    - Node 6: <6, (5, 11, 13)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <6, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 12)>
    - Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (3, 8, 11)>, <7, (4, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>
    - Node 10: <10, (11, 2, 14)>
    - Node 11: <11, (10, 13, 6)>, <11, (13, 2, 3)>, <11, (3, 12, 7)>
    - Node 12: <12, (11, 13, 0)>, <12, (3, 6, 7)>, <12, (0, 11, 12)>
    - Node 13: <13, (11, 8, 12)>, <13, (0, 6, 13)>, <13, (2, 6, 13)>, <13, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 13, 14)>, <0, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (10, 8, 13)>, <3, (7, 10, 11)>, <3, (6, 10, 12)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, 11, 13)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <6, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 12)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (3, 8, 11)>, <7, (4, 6, 13)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>, <10, (11, 2, 14)>, <11, (10, 13, 6)>, <11, (13, 2, 3)>, <11, (3, 12, 7)>
