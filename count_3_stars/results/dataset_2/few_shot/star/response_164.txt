Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 13, 11, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 14, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 14, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 13, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 10, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 13, 12, 14, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 6, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, 11, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, 11, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 13, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (3, 13, 11)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<5, (9, 12, 1)>
<6, (12, 14, 0)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<8, (9, 7, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<10, (9, 12, 2)>
<11, (7, 13, 12)>
<12, (5, 4, 10)>
<13, (4, 7, 8)>
<14, (4, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
