Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list provided:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 0.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 14.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 3.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 14, and 11.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 10.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 1.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 5.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 0.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and itself.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 7, and itself.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and itself.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 8, and 1.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 4, and 6.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 6, and itself.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<6, (9, 3, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<7, (9, 12, 3)>
<12, (7, 14, 11)>
<2, (6, 8, 10)>
<4, (9, 13, 1)>
<10, (9, 13, 5)>
<14, (9, 13, 0)>
<1, (4, 11, 1)>
<5, (10, 7, 5)>
<8, (2, 11, 8)>
<11, (12, 8, 11)>
<13, (10, 4, 13)>
<0, (14, 6, 0)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph, we get [14].
