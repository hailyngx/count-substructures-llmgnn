Response:
The 3-stars are groups of nodes where one node is at the center and connected to three other nodes. 

To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique configurations where a node is at the center and connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list and edge information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
