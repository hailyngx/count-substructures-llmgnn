Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 9, 2)>
2. <1, (8, 10, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 6, 3)>
4. <3, (11, 14, 5)>
5. <4, (13, 9, 14)>
6. <5, (8, 11, 6)>
7. <6, (13, 11, 0)>
8. <7, (10, 12, 9)>
9. <8, (5, 14, 1)>
10. <9, (11, 4, 7)>
11. <10, (13, 11, 7)>
12. <11, (13, 10, 3)>
13. <12, (7, 14, 9)>
14. <13, (4, 11, 10)>
15. <14, (8, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
