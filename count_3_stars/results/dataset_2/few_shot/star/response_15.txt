Node 18 is connected to node 15, 8, 13, and node 16
Node 19 is connected to node 12, 4, and node 16

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 0, Node 17, and Node 15 form a 3-star: <0, (15, 17, 15)>
- Similarly, Node 1, Node 4, and Node 16 form a 3-star: <1, (4, 16, 4)>
- Node 2, Node 8, and Node 18 form a 3-star: <2, (8, 18, 8)>
- Node 5, Node 9, and Node 14 form a 3-star: <5, (9, 14, 9)>
- Node 11, Node 13, and Node 6 form a 3-star: <11, (13, 6, 13)>
- Node 12, Node 19, and Node 16 form a 3-star: <12, (19, 16, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
