Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (6, 9, 3), (6, 4, 9), (6, 2, 0), and (0, 5, 7)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 5)
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (4, 6, 9), (4, 1, 8), and (4, 8, 6)
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with (6, 3, 0) and (6, 2, 0)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with (8, 1, 3)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (9, 8, 4)

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.

<0, (6, 9, 3), (6, 4, 9), (6, 2, 0), (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (4, 6, 9), (4, 1, 8), (4, 8, 6)>
<6, (6, 3, 0), (6, 2, 0)>
<8, (8, 1, 3)>
<9, (9, 8, 4)>
