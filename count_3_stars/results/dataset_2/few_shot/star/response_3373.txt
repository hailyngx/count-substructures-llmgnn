Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by considering each node as the potential center and checking if there are exactly three edges connected to it. Let's go through each node:

- For Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 4: <4, (6, 2, 9)>
- For Node 5: <5, (8, 1, 0)>
- For Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 7: <7, (5, 8, 1)>
- For Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
- For Node 9: Not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (6, 2, 9)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
