Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 11, 12, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 10, and node 7

Node 5 is connected to node 8, 13, 12, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, 12, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 2, 7, 3, 1, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

- From node 0: <0, (9, 7, 11)>
- From node 1: <1, (6, 9, 14)>
- From node 2: <2, (9, 8, 0)>
- From node 4: <4, (6, 13, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (8, 13, 12)>
- From node 6: <6, (9, 1, 11)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 2, 11)>
- From node 10: <10, (2, 7, 3)>
- From node 12: <12, (6, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
