Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: Identify candidate central nodes.
- Node 4 has 4 edges.
- Node 7 has 5 edges.
- Node 1 has 4 edges.
- Node 3 has 3 edges.
- Node 0 has 4 edges.
- Node 2 has 4 edges.
- Node 5 has 4 edges.
- Node 6 has 4 edges.
- Node 8 has 6 edges.
- Node 9 has 2 edges.

Step 2: Check if there are any 3-stars for each candidate central node.
- For Node 4: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>
- For Node 1: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 3: Not a central node as it has 3 edges.
- For Node 0: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 2: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 5: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 6: Not a central node as it has 4 edges.
- For Node 8: <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (7, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 0)>
- For Node 9: Not a central node as it has 2 edges.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
- Number of 3-stars: 5
