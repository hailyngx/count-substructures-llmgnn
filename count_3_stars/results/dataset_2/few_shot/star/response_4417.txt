Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
To form a 3-star, we need a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the adjacency list to identify 3-stars.

1. Start by examining each node and its connections to check if they form a 3-star.
2. Count the number of 3-stars formed by each node.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 11, 8)>
<1, (5, 13, 8)>
<1, (5, 13, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (12, 14, 1)>
<6, (12, 14, 11)>
<7, (12, 11, 10)>
<7, (12, 11, 6)>
<8, (0, 14, 11)>
<8, (0, 14, 13)>
<11, (7, 0, 14)>
<11, (7, 0, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
