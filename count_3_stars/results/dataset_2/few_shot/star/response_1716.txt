Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. The center node will have degree 3 and the other three nodes will be leaves. Given that the graph has 10 nodes and each 3-star occupies 4 nodes, we can proceed as follows:

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following center nodes that have degree 3: 
- Node 0 is the center for the 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9
- Node 1 is the center for the 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8
- Node 3 is the center for the 3-star with nodes 6, 2, and 5
- Node 7 is the center for the 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 1

Thus, we have identified the following unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (6, 2, 5)>
- <7, (8, 9, 1)>

Finally, counting the number of 3-stars we have found in the given graph, we get a total of [4].
