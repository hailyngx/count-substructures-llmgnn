Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in the given graph:

- Node 2 has the neighbors: 4, 8, 0, 5, and 1
- Node 4 has the neighbors: 7, 1, and 2
- Node 6 has the neighbors: 7, 1, 3, and 8
- Node 8 has the neighbors: 6, 9, 2, 5, 0, and 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Looking at Node 2:
    - (2, 4, 8) forms a 3-star <2, (4, 8)>.
    - (2, 4, 1) forms a 3-star <2, (4, 1)>.
    - (2, 4, 5) forms a 3-star <2, (4, 5)>.
    - (2, 8, 5) forms a 3-star <2, (8, 5)>.
    - (2, 8, 0) forms a 3-star <2, (8, 0)>.
    - (2, 0, 5) forms a 3-star <2, (0, 5)>.
    Total 3-stars from Node 2: 4

2. Looking at Node 4:
    - (4, 2, 1) forms a 3-star <4, (2, 1)>.
    Total 3-stars from Node 4: 1

3. Looking at Node 6:
    - (6, 1, 7) forms a 3-star <6, (1, 7)>.
    - (6, 1, 3) forms a 3-star <6, (1, 3)>.
    - (6, 1, 8) forms a 3-star <6, (1, 8)>.
    Total 3-stars from Node 6: 3

4. Looking at Node 8:
    - (8, 6, 9) forms a 3-star <8, (6, 9)>.
    - (8, 6, 2) forms a 3-star <8, (6, 2)>.
    - (8, 6, 5) forms a 3-star <8, (6, 5)>.
    - (8, 6, 1) forms a 3-star <8, (6, 1)>.
    Total 3-stars from Node 8: 4

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 3 + 4] = [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 8)>
<2, (4, 1)>
<2, (4, 5)>
<2, (8, 5)>
<2, (8, 0)>
<2, (0, 5)>
<4, (2, 1)>
<6, (1, 7)>
<6, (1, 3)>
<6, (1, 8)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<8, (6, 2)>
<8, (6, 5)>
<8, (6, 1)>
