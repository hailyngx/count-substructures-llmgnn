Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 4, 1, 5
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 7, 2, 5
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 1, 0, 9
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 7, 6, 9
5. Central node: 4, Leaves: 7, 8, 0
6. Central node: 5, Leaves: 1, 6, 0
7. Central node: 6, Leaves: 3, 8, 5
8. Central node: 7, Leaves: 4, 3, 1
9. Central node: 8, Leaves: 4, 7, 1
10. Central node: 9, Leaves: 3, 0, 2

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 0, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>
<6, (3, 8, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 1)>
<8, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (3, 0, 2)>
