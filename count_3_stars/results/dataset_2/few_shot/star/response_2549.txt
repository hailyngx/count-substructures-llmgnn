Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 17, 26)>
<2, (0, 14, 8)>
<3, (7, 13, 18)>
<4, (0, 6, 12)>
<5, (0, 1, 22)>
<6, (4, 12, 16)>
<7, (3, 19, 21)>
<8, (8, 14, 27)>
<9, (21, 9, 18)>
<10, (10, 22, 24)>
<11, (11, 17, 22)>
<12, (12, 14, 16)>
<13, (13, 18, 22)>
<14, (14, 29, 8)>
<15, (15, 24, 27)>
<16, (16, 12, 25)>
<17, (17, 11, 29)>
<18, (18, 13, 25)>
<19, (19, 10, 24)>
<20, (20, 23, 0)>
<21, (21, 18, 7)>
<22, (22, 10, 5)>
<23, (23, 26, 20)>
<24, (24, 10, 15)>
<25, (25, 16, 18)>
<26, (26, 1, 23)>
<27, (27, 8, 15)>
<28, (28, 29, 20)>
<29, (29, 17, 14)>

To count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we simply count the number of unique 3-star patterns listed above. Since we have 29 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
