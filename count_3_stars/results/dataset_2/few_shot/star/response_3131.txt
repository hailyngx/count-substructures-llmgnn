Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. For each node, find all the 3-stars centered at that node.

    - For Node 0: No 3-stars centered at Node 0.
    
    - For Node 1: No 3-stars centered at Node 1.
    
    - For Node 2: Found one 3-star centered at Node 2: <2, (9, 4, 7)>.
    
    - For Node 3: No 3-stars centered at Node 3.
    
    - For Node 4: Found one 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (9, 6, 2)>.
    
    - For Node 5: No 3-stars centered at Node 5.
    
    - For Node 6: No 3-stars centered at Node 6.
    
    - For Node 7: No 3-stars centered at Node 7.
    
    - For Node 8: No 3-stars centered at Node 8.
    
    - For Node 9: Found one 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>.
    
2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 2

3. List the unique 3-stars:

    - <2, (9, 4, 7)>
    
    - <4, (9, 6, 2)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
