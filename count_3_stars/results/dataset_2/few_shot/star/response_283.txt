Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 14, 12)>
<1, (4, 6, 10)>
<2, (7, 13, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 13)>
<4, (9, 12, 0)>
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<7, (11, 13, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 14)>
<9, (8, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 4, 6)>
<11, (7, 14, 3)>
<12, (9, 4, 10)>
<13, (7, 12, 2)>
<14, (8, 6, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
