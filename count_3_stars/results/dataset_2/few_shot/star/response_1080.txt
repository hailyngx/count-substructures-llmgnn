Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list and edge information, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (10, 9, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 0)>
<3, (7, 10, 12)>
<4, (9, 10, 14)>
<5, (11, 0, 7)>
<6, (2, 11, 12)>
<7, (3, 8, 5)>
<8, (14, 12, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<10, (1, 3, 4)>
<11, (13, 5, 6)>
<12, (3, 8, 13)>
<13, (12, 11)>
<14, (8, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
