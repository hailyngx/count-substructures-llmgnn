Response:
Let's go through the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

1. For each node, check its neighbors to see if there's a 3-star centered at that node.

2. Let's list the 3-stars we find along the way inside <>. We will only list each unique 3-star once.

Starting from each node:

Node 0: No 3-star.

Node 1: <1, (15, 4, 16)>

Node 2: No 3-star.

Node 3: <3, (26, 8, 13)>

Node 4: <4, (25, 15, 17)>  <4, (25, 2, 17)>  <4, (25, 2, 6)>

Node 5: No 3-star.

Node 6: <6, (25, 4, 24)>  <6, (25, 4, 2)>  <6, (25, 4, 21)>  <6, (25, 4, 6)>

Node 7: No 3-star.

Node 8: <8, (29, 3, 27)>  <8, (29, 3, 8)>  <8, (29, 3, 13)>

Node 9: <9, (29, 5, 28)>  <9, (29, 14, 23)>  <9, (29, 14, 2)>  <9, (29, 14, 21)>  <9, (29, 14, 5)>  <9, (29, 14, 9)>

Node 10: No 3-star.

Node 11: No 3-star.

Node 12: No 3-star.

Node 13: <13, (17, 3, 23)>  <13, (17, 7, 23)>  <13, (17, 4, 23)>  <13, (17, 7, 3)>  <13, (17, 4, 7)>

Node 14: <14, (9, 2, 21)>  <14, (9, 2, 4)>

Node 15: No 3-star.

Node 16: No 3-star.

Node 17: No 3-star.

Node 18: No 3-star.

Node 19: No 3-star.

Node 20: No 3-star.

Node 21: No 3-star.

Node 22: No 3-star.

Node 23: <23, (13, 24, 11)>  <23, (13, 24, 6)>  <23, (13, 24, 4)>  <23, (13, 24, 23)>

Node 24: No 3-star.

Node 25: No 3-star.

Node 26: <26, (19, 27, 3)>  <26, (19, 27, 8)>  <26, (19, 27, 28)>  <26, (19, 27, 26)>

Node 27: No 3-star.

Node 28: No 3-star.

Node 29: No 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23], and they are: 
<1, (15, 4, 16)>, <3, (26, 8, 13)>, <4, (25, 15, 17)>, <4, (25, 2, 17)>, <4, (25, 2, 6)>, <6, (25, 4, 24)>, <6, (25, 4, 2)>, <6, (25, 4, 21)>, <6, (25, 4, 6)>, <8, (29, 3, 27)>, <8, (29, 3, 8)>, <8, (29, 3, 13)>, <9, (29, 5, 28)>, <9, (29, 14, 23)>, <9, (29, 14, 2)>, <9, (29, 14, 21)>, <9, (29, 14, 5)>, <9, (29, 14, 9)>, <13, (17, 3, 23)>, <13, (17, 7, 23)>, <13, (17, 4, 23)>, <13, (17, 7, 3)>, <13, (17, 4, 7)>, <23, (13, 24, 11)>, <23, (13, 24, 6)>, <23, (13, 24, 4)>, <23, (13, 24, 23)>.
