Response:
There are many 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them out to count them:

<0, (7, 6, 12)>
<1, (6, 13, 10)>
<1, (6, 13, 2)>
<1, (6, 13, 18)>
<1, (6, 13, 3)>
<2, (9, 18, 13)>
<4, (7, 18, 16)>
<4, (7, 3, 14)>
<4, (7, 3, 16)>
<4, (7, 14, 16)>
<16, (8, 5, 3)>
<16, (8, 5, 4)>
<16, (8, 5, 16)>
<16, (8, 3, 4)>
<16, (8, 3, 5)>
<16, (8, 4, 5)>
<18, (13, 2, 15)>
<18, (13, 2, 4)>
<18, (13, 2, 18)>
<18, (13, 4, 15)>
<18, (13, 4, 18)>
<18, (13, 15, 18)>
<19, (11, 17, 15)>
<19, (11, 17, 19)>
<19, (11, 15, 17)>
<19, (11, 15, 19)>
<19, (11, 17, 15)>
<19, (11, 17, 19)>
<19, (11, 15, 17)>
<19, (11, 15, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
