Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 12, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, 1, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 0, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 14, 3, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 13, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 10, 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 6: (9, 5, 14)
2. Node 4: (7, 10, 1)
3. Node 5: (6, 7, 14)
4. Node 2: (9, 8, 12)
5. Node 3: (6, 0, 10)
6. Node 7: (4, 0, 13)
7. Node 8: (2, 10, 11)
8. Node 9: (6, 2, 0)
9. Node 10: (4, 8, 3)
10. Node 11: (4, 8, 13)
11. Node 12: (6, 8, 11)
12. Node 13: (7, 11, 14)

From the above list, we can see that there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
<6, (9, 5, 14)>, <4, (7, 10, 1)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <2, (9, 8, 12)>, <3, (6, 0, 10)>, <7, (4, 0, 13)>, <8, (2, 10, 11)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <10, (4, 8, 3)>, <11, (4, 8, 13)>, <12, (6, 8, 11)>, <13, (7, 11, 14)>
