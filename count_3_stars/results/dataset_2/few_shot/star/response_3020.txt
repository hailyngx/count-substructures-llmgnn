Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars, which are subgraphs in the form of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
1. <0, (6, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (6, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 8, 1)>
4. <3, (6, 4, 5)>
5. <4, (6, 0, 3)>
6. <5, (7, 8, 3)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 4)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 8)>
9. <8, (7, 5, 3)>
10. <9, (6, 2, 7)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
