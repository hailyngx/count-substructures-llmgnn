Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

- For each central node, we need to check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes and form a 3-star graph.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars we find: 

<5, (0, 3, 10)>
<9, (2, 13, 16)>
<4, (1, 8, 19)>
<7, (12, 14, 15)>
<8, (10, 19, 4)>
<12, (7)>
<15, (0, 13, 7)>
<16, (18, 1, 9)>
<6, (17, 11, 18)>
<17, (0, 2, 6)>
<13, (9, 11, 15)>
<14, (7, 18)>
<0, (5, 17, 15)>
<2, (9, 17, 3)>
<1, (4, 10, 16)>
<18, (11, 6, 16)>
<10, (5, 1, 8)>
<11, (17, 18, 6)>
<19, (8, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [19].
