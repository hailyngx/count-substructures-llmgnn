Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star patterns. In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Next, we will list down all the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
