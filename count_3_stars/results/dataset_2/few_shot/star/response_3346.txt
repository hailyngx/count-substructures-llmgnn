Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 9, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 9, 4)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 1, 8)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (9, 3, 8)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
