Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern by looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 2, 9)>
<3, (6, 2, 4)>
<3, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (3, 1, 7)>
<3, (3, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<3, (8, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have: [20]
