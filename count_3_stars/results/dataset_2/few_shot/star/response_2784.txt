Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 11) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 13, 12, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 13, 12, 11, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 6, 10, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 12, 2, 3, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 11, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 10, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 12, 11)>
<3, (6, 13, 12)>
<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (4, 12, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<10, (7, 8, 3)>
<11, (13, 12, 2)>
<12, (7, 6, 2)>
<13, (5, 11, 3)>
<14, (11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
