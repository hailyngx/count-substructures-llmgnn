Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 1, forming a 3-star <0, (7, 5, 1)>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 3, forming a 3-star <2, (9, 6, 3)>.
3. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 0, forming a 3-star <9, (4, 7, 0)>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star <3, (4, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

Final answer: [4]
