Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star in the graph. 

1. Start by identifying the central node of the 3-star. 
2. For each central node, identify the three neighboring nodes to determine if there is a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- <0, (5, 6, 12)>
- <0, (5, 6, 1)>
  Total: 2

For Node 1:
- <1, (13, 6, 10)>
- <1, (13, 6, 0)>
  Total: 2

For Node 2:
No 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node.

For Node 3:
No 3-stars with Node 3 as the central node.

For Node 4:
- <4, (7, 11, 12)>
  Total: 1

For Node 5:
No 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node.

For Node 6:
- <6, (7, 13, 5)>
- <6, (7, 13, 1)>
  Total: 2

For Node 7:
- <7, (4, 11, 14)>
  Total: 1

For Node 8:
No 3-stars with Node 8 as the central node.

For Node 9:
- <9, (12, 11, 14)>
  Total: 1

For Node 10:
No 3-stars with Node 10 as the central node.

For Node 11:
No 3-stars with Node 11 as the central node.

For Node 12:
No 3-stars with Node 12 as the central node.

For Node 13:
No 3-stars with Node 13 as the central node.

For Node 14:
No 3-stars with Node 14 as the central node.

Counting the total 3-stars found above, we have a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
