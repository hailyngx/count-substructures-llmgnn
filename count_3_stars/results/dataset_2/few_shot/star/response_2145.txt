Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for every possible 3-star configuration. 
Let's go node by node to identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: <0, (7, 6, 1)>
- For Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 3)>
- For Node 2: <2, (4, 11, 13)>
- For Node 3: <3, (7, 1, 2)>
- For Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 10)>
- For Node 5: <5, (13, 1, 4)>
- For Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 14)>
- For Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 11)>
- For Node 8: <8, (13, 12, 6)>
- For Node 9: <9, (6, 11, 13)>
- For Node 10: <10, (4, 12, 0)>
- For Node 11: <11, (9, 7, 0)>
- For Node 12: <12, (10, 8, 3)>
- For Node 13: <13, (5, 9, 11)>
- For Node 14: <14, (6, 1, 2)>

Counting them all, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
