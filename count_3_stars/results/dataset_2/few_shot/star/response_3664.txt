Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 10. <0, (9, 14, 10)>

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 26, 22, and 5. <1, (26, 22, 5)>

3. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 17. <3, (4, 10, 17)>

4. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 28, and 21. <4, (18, 28, 21)>

5. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 22, and 16. <5, (1, 22, 16)>

6. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 9. <6, (15, 27, 9)>

7. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 29, and 18. <7, (12, 29, 18)>

8. For Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 27, 6, and 25. <9, (27, 6, 25)>

9. For Node 15:
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 20, and 6. <15, (27, 20, 6)>

10. For Node 18:
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 20, and 4. <18, (7, 20, 4)>

11. For Node 19:
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 25, and 28. <19, (6, 25, 28)>

12. For Node 26:
   - Node 26 is connected to nodes 8, 23, and 1. <26, (8, 23, 1)>

13. For Node 27:
   - Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 11, and 9. <27, (15, 11, 9)>

14. For Node 28:
   - Node 28 is connected to nodes 7, 20, and 4. <28, (7, 20, 4)>

15. For Node 25:
   - Node 25 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 17. <25, (9, 18, 17)>

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (9, 14, 10)>, <1, (26, 22, 5)>, <3, (4, 10, 17)>, <4, (18, 28, 21)>, <5, (1, 22, 16)>, <6, (15, 27, 9)>, <7, (12, 29, 18)>, <9, (27, 6, 25)>, <15, (27, 20, 6)>, <18, (7, 20, 4)>, <19, (6, 25, 28)>, <26, (8, 23, 1)>, <27, (15, 11, 9)>, <28, (7, 20, 4)>, <25, (9, 18, 17)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
