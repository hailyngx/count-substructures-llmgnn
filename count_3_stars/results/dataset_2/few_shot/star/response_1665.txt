Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given the adjacency list and the edges in the graph, we can determine that the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (8, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
