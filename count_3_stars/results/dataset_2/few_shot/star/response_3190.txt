Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
