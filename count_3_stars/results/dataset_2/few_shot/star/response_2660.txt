Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 11, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 10, 11, 2, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 13, 2, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 13, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 12, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 10, 3, 14, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 10, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 11, and node 3

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

- <2, (7, 8, 11)>
- <6, (5, 9, 13)>
- <9, (4, 6, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
