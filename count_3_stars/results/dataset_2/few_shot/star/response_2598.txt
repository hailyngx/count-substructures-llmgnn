Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's now identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<10, (11, 12, 1)>
<11, (10, 14, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<6, (11, 5, 1)>
<0, (6, 14, 8)>
<14, (10, 11, 0)>
<2, (8, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 7, 12)>
<4, (11, 14, 12)>
<12, (10, 3, 4)>
<1, (10, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 14, 8)>
<13, (10, 9, 4)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [14]
