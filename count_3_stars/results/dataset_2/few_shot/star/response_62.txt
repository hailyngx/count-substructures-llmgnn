Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 2) (8, 19) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 4) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 6) (5, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 16) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 0)

Node 18 is connected to node 7, 14, 1, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 8, 1, 2, and node 9

Response:
There are five 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the detailed breakdown of the 3-stars:

1. <4, (2, 3, 16)>
2. <7, (4, 6, 18)>
3. <13, (0, 7, 15)>
4. <16, (4, 9, 10)>
5. <18, (0, 1, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
