Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's list out the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
