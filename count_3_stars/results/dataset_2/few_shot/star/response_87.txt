Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by finding the central node and the three leaves connected to it.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (24, 11, 29)>
<4, (8, 26, 23)>
<8, (4, 16, 15)>
<13, (17, 25, 14)>
<14, (13, 27, 11)>
<15, (8, 26, 6)>
<16, (8, 12, 3)>
<17, (13, 23, 0)>
<18, (9, 25, 20)>
<19, (29, 11, 27)>
<20, (14, 24, 18)>
<22, (9, 12, 18)>
<23, (4, 17, 3)>
<24, (2, 9, 11)>
<25, (13, 5, 18)>
<26, (4, 28, 15)>
<27, (6, 14, 19)>
<28, (9, 26, 1)>
<29, (19, 11, 27)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
