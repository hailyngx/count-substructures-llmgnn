Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars.

Let's go step-by-step and identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify the central nodes:
- Node 5 has degree 4 (connected to nodes 8, 4, 0, 3).
- Node 9 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 4, 2, 3).
- Node 6 has degree 4 (connected to nodes 1, 7, 3, 2).
- Node 1 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 6, 3, 4).
- Node 4 has degree 6 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 8, 2).

2. For each central node, identify the 3-stars:
- For node 5: <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 3, 6)>, <5, (8, 3, 1)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>
- For node 9: <9, (4, 2, 3)>
- For node 6: <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 2, 4)>
- For node 1: <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>
- For node 4: <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (1, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 3, 6)>, <5, (8, 3, 1)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 2, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>.
