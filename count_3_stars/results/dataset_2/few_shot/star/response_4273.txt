Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that serve as the center of a 3-star. Since the definition of a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 12

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (11, 17, 6)>
<7, (2, 14, 7)>
<12, (1, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
