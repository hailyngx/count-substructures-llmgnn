Response:
Following the steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. First, identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure:
    - Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 13, 11, 7, and 14
    - Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, and 7 (note: 5 is already counted)
    - Node 13 has neighbors: 5, 1, 12, 4, 11, and 14 (note: 5 and 14 are already counted)

2. Now, find the 3-stars in the graph:
    - Considering Node 5 as the central node:
        - <5, (9, 13, 11)>
        - <5, (9, 13, 7)>
        - <5, (9, 11, 7)>
        - <5, (13, 11, 7)>
    
    - Considering Node 9 as the central node:
        - <9, (5, 13, 7)>
        - <9, (5, 11, 7)>
        - <9, (5, 13, 4)>

    - Considering Node 13 as the central node:
        - <13, (5, 11, 14)>
        - <13, (5, 1, 4)>
        - <13, (5, 12, 14)>

3. In total, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
   
Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 13, 11)>
<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 7)>
<5, (13, 11, 7)>
<9, (5, 13, 7)>
<9, (5, 11, 7)>
<9, (5, 13, 4)>
<13, (5, 11, 14)>
<13, (5, 1, 4)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>
