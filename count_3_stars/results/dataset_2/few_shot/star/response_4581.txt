Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 2, and 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 2, and 1
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 6, and 4
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 3
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 4
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, and 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 7
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, and 6
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, and 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From the nodes above, we can see that the following 3-stars exist in the graph:
    <5, (6, 2, 1)>
    <9, (4, 2, 1)>
    <1, (5, 9, 8)>
    <3, (7, 6, 4)>
    <4, (5, 9, 3)>
    <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    <6, (5, 3, 8)>
    <2, (5, 9, 7)>
    <0, (9, 8, 6)>
    <7, (3, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
