Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star is a structure where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided information, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Central Node 0: (5, 6, 8), (5, 12, 14)
2. Central Node 1: (3, 2, 10)
3. Central Node 2: (1, 3, 6)  
4. Central Node 3: (1, 2, 6)  
5. Central Node 4: (5, 8, 13)
6. Central Node 5: (0, 7, 14)
7. Central Node 6: (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 12), (4, 7, 9)
8. Central Node 7: (1, 5, 10)
9. Central Node 8: (0, 2, 6), (0, 4, 12)
10. Central Node 9: (4, 6, 10)
11. Central Node 10: (1, 4, 7), (1, 10, 13)
12. Central Node 12: (0, 3, 8), (4, 10, 13)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 12, 14)>, <1, (3, 2, 10)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 8, 13)>, <5, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 12)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 10)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 12)>, <9, (4, 6, 10)>, <10, (1, 4, 7)>, <10, (1, 10, 13)>, <12, (0, 3, 8)>, <12, (4, 10, 13)>.
