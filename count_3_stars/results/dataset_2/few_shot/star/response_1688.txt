Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the nodes which have exactly three neighbors. Then, we check if each such node and its three neighbors form a 3-star. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 4, 8, 11

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (13, 12, 1)>
<4, (8, 13, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
