To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves that form 3-stars.

Let's first identify the central nodes and their connected nodes based on the given adjacency list:
- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 7, 17, and 12.
- Central node 1 is connected to node 15.
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 16, and 10.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 11.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 12.
- Central node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 7, and 18.
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 0, 14, 6, and 2.
- Central node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 11.
- Central node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 19.
- Central node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 18, and 16.
- Central node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 19.
- Central node 12 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

- Central node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 6, and 10.
- Central node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 11.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

There are [<0, (14, 7, 17)>, <0, (14, 7, 12)>, <0, (14, 17, 5)>, <0, (7, 3, 14)>, <0, (7, 14, 5)>, <14, (0, 6, 7)>, <14, (0, 7, 5)>, <14, (6, 7, 5)>, <7, (3, 0, 14)>, <7, (6, 7, 14)>, <3, (7, 0, 14)>, <4, (15, 8, 11)>, <4, (15, 8, 9)>, <4, (15, 11, 19)>, <4, (8, 4, 11)>, <8, (4, 9, 8)>, <8, (9, 8, 11)>, <8, (4, 8, 11)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 9, 19)>, <9, (3, 9, 19)>, <15, (1, 13, 15)>, <15, (4, 15, 13)>, <15, (13, 15, 16)>, <15, (1, 15, 4)>, <1, (15, 1, 13)>, <1, (15, 1, 4)>, <13, (15, 16, 13)>, <13, (16, 13, 18)>, <13, (15, 13, 18)>, <16, (13, 16, 2)>, <16, (2, 16, 10)>, <16, (13, 16, 18)>, <17, (0, 19, 17)>, <17, (5, 17, 19)>, <17, (0, 14, 17)>, <17, (5, 14, 17)>, <19, (9, 11, 19)>, <19, (17, 19, 11)>, <19, (9, 19, 17)>, <5, (14, 17, 5)>, <5, (17, 5, 12)>, <5, (14, 5, 12)>, <6, (14, 7, 6)>, <6, (7, 6, 18)>, <6, (14, 6, 18)>, <2, (7, 2, 16)>, <2, (16, 2, 10)>, <2, (7, 2, 10)>, <10, (2, 18, 10)>, <10, (18, 10, 16)>, <10, (2, 10, 16)>, <11, (4, 8, 11)>, <11, (8, 11, 19)>, <11, (4, 11, 19)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].
