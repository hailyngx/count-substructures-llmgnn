Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 7, 4)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 4)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (9, 6, 2)>
6. <5, (9, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (9, 3, 8)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 3)>
9. <8, (6, 3, 9)>
10. <9, (6, 4, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
