Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the 3-stars for each central node:
   - For each node, count the number of 3-stars with that node as the central node.
   - A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Count the number of 3-stars by adding the counts from each central node.

Let's begin:

### Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 2, 19, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 17.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 0, and 12.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 13.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 9, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 0, and 14.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the central node: [1, (6, 16, 7, 14)]
  
### Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 1.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 5, 9, and 4.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 15 and 2.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 10 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 19, 5, and 17.
- Number of 3-stars with Node 11 as the central node: [0]
  
### Node 12:
