Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 13, 2, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 14, 13, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 12, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 14, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 11, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 13, 2, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 1, 12, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 1, 12)>
<1, (5, 14, 13)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<3, (5, 10, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 11)>
<5, (9, 2, 10)>
<6, (9, 14, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<8, (7, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<10, (5, 7, 11)>
<11, (4, 7, 12)>
<12, (11, 13, 2)>
<13, (6, 1, 12)>
<14, (9, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
