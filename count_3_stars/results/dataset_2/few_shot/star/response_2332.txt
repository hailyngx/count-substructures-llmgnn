Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <0, (6, 9, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 1, 8)>
4. <3, (7, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (7, 9, 6)>
6. <5, (7, 0, 8)>
7. <6, (4, 7, 1)>
8. <7, (4, 3, 6)>
9. <8, (9, 0, 2)>
10. <9, (4, 1, 3)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars.
