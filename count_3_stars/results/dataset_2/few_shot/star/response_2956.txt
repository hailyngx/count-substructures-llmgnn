Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check its neighbors to identify any 3-star patterns.
2. Count the number of 3-stars found.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 29: <1, (2, 4, 29)>
2. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 18, and 23: <14, (17, 18, 23)>
3. Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 15: <27, (7, 8, 15)>
