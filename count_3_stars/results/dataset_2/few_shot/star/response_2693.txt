Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can observe that a 3-star is uniquely defined by its center node and the three leaves connected to it. Since we have 10 nodes in the graph, we can go through each node and check for possible 3-stars around it.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[5]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

<5, (2, 1, 3)>
