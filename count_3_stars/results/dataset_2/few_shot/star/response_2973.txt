Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the adjacency list provided for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<Node 0, (2, 10, 19)>
<Node 1, (21, 3, 25)>
<Node 2, (29, 23, 28), (0, 25, 21)>
<Node 3, (1, 12, 27)>
<Node 4, (26, 22, 24)>
<Node 5, (13, 10)>
<Node 6, (21, 16, 27)>
<Node 7, (21, 11, 27)>
<Node 8, (23, 24, 15)>
<Node 9, (26, 21, 11)>
<Node 10, (5, 18, 19)>
<Node 11, (9, 7, 25)>
<Node 13, (17, 29, 5)>
<Node 16, (26, 6)>
<Node 17, (26, 13, 28)>
<Node 18, (15, 10)>
<Node 19, (0, 10, 27)>
<Node 20, (25, 27, 22)>
<Node 21, (9, 26, 1)>
<Node 22, (4, 20)>
<Node 24, (9, 8, 4)>
<Node 25, (1, 2, 20)>
<Node 26, (9, 21, 16)>
<Node 27, (7, 3, 20)>
<Node 28, (17, 2)>
<Node 29, (2, 13)>
