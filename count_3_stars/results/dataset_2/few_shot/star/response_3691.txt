Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3
