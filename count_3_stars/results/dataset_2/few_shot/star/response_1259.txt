Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

There are a total of ten 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
