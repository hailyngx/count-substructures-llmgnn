Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 11, 14.
  - <0, (1, 8, 11)>
  - <0, (1, 8, 14)>
  - <0, (11, 8, 14)>
  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2.
  - <1, (3, 6, 2)>

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 14.
  - <2, (1, 13, 14)>
  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 6.
  - <3, (1, 7, 6)>
  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 7.
  - <5, (10, 14, 7)>
  - <5, (10, 14, 2)>
  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 14.
  - <6, (1, 3, 14)>
  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 0, 14.
  - <7, (3, 0, 14)>
  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 11.
  - <8, (13, 4, 11)>
  
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 12, 4, 9.
  - <10, (12, 4, 9)>
  
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 11.
  - <12, (13, 10, 11)>
  
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 2.
  - <13, (8, 12, 2)>
  
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
  - <14, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
