Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars:

<1, (6, 15, 16)>
<2, (7, 15, 18)>
<3, (8, 12, 13)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (12, 19, 4)>
<6, (1, 9, 17)>
<7, (2, 17, 7)>
<8, (3, 12, 16)>
<9, (0, 6, 14)>
<10, (1)>
<11, (0, 12, 18)>
<12, (3, 5, 11)>
<13, (3, 19)>
<14, (9, 11)>
<15, (1, 2)>
<16, (1, 8)>
<17, (1, 7, 11)>
<18, (2, 11)>
<19, (0, 13, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
