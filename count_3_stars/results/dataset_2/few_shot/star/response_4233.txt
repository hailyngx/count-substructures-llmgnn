Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars. Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (20, 18, 22)>
<3, (4, 11, 26)>
<4, (7, 19, 23)>
<7, (4, 21, 9)>
<9, (7, 21, 10)>
<11, (6, 3, 14)>
<13, (28, 27, 23)>
<14, (11, 27, 9)>
<16, (29, 24, 1)>
<17, (7, 29, 8)>
<18, (2, 19, 29)>
<19, (4, 18, 22)>
<20, (25, 27, 2)>
<21, (7, 9, 17)>
<22, (2, 19, 1)>
<23, (4, 2, 6)>
<24, (28, 10, 16)>
<26, (3, 8, 12)>
<27, (20, 14, 13)>

We have found all the unique 3-stars. The number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
