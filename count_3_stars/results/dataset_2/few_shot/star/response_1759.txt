Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node.

Let's determine the 3-stars around each node:
- Node 3 has 3-stars: <3, (15, 21, 28)>, <3, (15, 1, 23)>, <3, (21, 7, 10)>, and <3, (6, 14, 10)>
- Node 6 has 3-stars: <6, (3, 14, 20)>, <6, (14, 6, 2)>, and <6, (10, 21, 28)>
- Node 10 has 3-stars: <10, (6, 21, 28)>, <10, (21, 13, 2)>, and <10, (6, 14, 16)>
- Node 13 has 3-stars: <13, (21, 28, 29)>, <13, (21, 10, 2)>, and <13, (3, 25, 29)>
- Node 14 has 3-stars: <14, (6, 26, 20)> and <14, (2, 6, 17)>
- Node 15 has 3-stars: <15, (3, 23, 1)>
- Node 16 has 3-stars: <16, (12, 23, 10)>
- Node 17 has 3-stars: <17, (2, 5, 19)> and <17, (2, 11, 4)>
- Node 18 has 3-stars: <18, (12, 0, 27)>
- Node 19 has 3-stars: <19, (17, 5, 8)>
- Node 20 has 3-stars: <20, (26, 6, 1)>
- Node 21 has 3-stars: <21, (10, 28, 13)>
- Node 23 has 3-stars: <23, (16, 12, 15)>
- Node 24 has no 3-stars
- Node 25 has no 3-stars
- Node 26 has no 3-stars
- Node 27 has no 3-stars
- Node 28 has no 3-stars
- Node 29 has no 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (15, 21, 28)>, <3, (15, 1, 23)>, <3, (21, 7, 10)>, <3, (6, 14, 10)>, <6, (3, 14, 20)>, <6, (14, 6, 2)>, <6, (10, 21, 28)>, <10, (6, 21, 28)>, <10, (21, 13, 2)>, <10, (6, 14, 16)>, <13, (21, 28, 29)>, <13, (21, 10, 2)>, <13, (3, 25, 29)>, <14, (6, 26, 20)>, <14, (2, 6, 17)>, <15, (3, 23, 1)>, <16, (12, 23, 10)>, <17, (2, 5, 19)>, <17, (2, 11, 4)>, <18, (12, 0, 27)>, <19, (17, 5, 8)>, <20, (26, 6, 1)>, <21, (10, 28, 13)>, <23, (16, 12, 15)>
