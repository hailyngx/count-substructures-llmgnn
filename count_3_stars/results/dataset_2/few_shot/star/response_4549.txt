Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2)

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star in the graph. These nodes will have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 7 (neighbors: 5, 9, 14)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 1, 3, 13)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 1, 8, 11)

Next, let's find the 3-stars centered at these nodes:

- For Node 7:
<7, (5, 9, 14)>

- For Node 10:
<10, (1, 3, 13)>

- For Node 14:
<14, (1, 11, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [3].
