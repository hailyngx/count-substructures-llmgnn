Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the potential 3-stars by looking at each node and its connections. Then we check if each node can be the center of a 3-star by ensuring its degree is exactly 3, and if so, identify the neighboring nodes connected to it. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (11, 6, 8)>
<2, (11, 16, 4)>
<3, (16, 19, 12)>
<4, (10, 2, 9)>
<6, (17, 0, 13)>
<7, (5, 13, 8)>
<10, (17, 11, 18)>
<11, (10, 0, 13)>
<12, (18, 8, 3)>
<13, (14, 11, 6)>
<15, (14, 11, 16)>
<16, (2, 15, 3)>
<18, (10, 12, 8)>
<19, (16, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
