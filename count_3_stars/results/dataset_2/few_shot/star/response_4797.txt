Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 2, 1)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 12)>
3. <4, (8, 2, 12)>
4. <8, (9, 4, 2)>
5. <6, (5, 14, 7)>
6. <2, (5, 9, 4)>
7. <12, (9, 4, 13)>
8. <1, (5, 2, 10)>
9. <7, (6, 11, 10)>
10. <0, (5, 8, 6)>
11. <3, (14, 13, 0)>

[There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
