Response:
First, we need to identify nodes that are connected in a way that forms a 3-star structure. Remember that a 3-star structure consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list and the total number of edges, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph. Let's list them:

<1, (15, 17, 6)>
<1, (15, 10, 7)>
<1, (15, 7, 9)>
<1, (17, 19, 8)>
<1, (17, 8, 7)>
<1, (17, 7, 13)>
<4, (12, 14, 6)>
<4, (12, 14, 9)>
<4, (12, 14, 11)>
<4, (9, 19, 13)>
<4, (14, 11, 5)>
<15, (10, 18, 5)>
<15, (18, 16, 3)>
<17, (19, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (19, 0, 13)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above within square brackets []:
