Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node 0:
    - Neighbor nodes: 7, 10, 11, 4
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 0: 0

2. Central Node 1:
    - Neighbor nodes: 3, 11, 13
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 1: 0

3. Central Node 2:
    - Neighbor nodes: 14, 11
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 2: 0

4. Central Node 3:
    - Neighbor nodes: 6, 1, 11, 7, 8
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 3: 0

5. Central Node 4:
    - Neighbor nodes: 5, 6, 13, 0
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 4: 1 (4, 6, 13)

6. Central Node 5:
    - Neighbor nodes: 9, 12, 4, 14
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 5: 3 (5, 9, 12), (5, 4, 14), (5, 4, 6)

7. Central Node 6:
    - Neighbor nodes: 9, 10, 3, 8, 4
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 6: 3 (6, 9, 10), (6, 3, 8), (6, 3, 4)

8. Central Node 7:
    - Neighbor nodes: 3, 13, 0, 14
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 7: 0

9. Central Node 8:
    - Neighbor nodes: 6, 3, 13, 12
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 8: 0

10. Central Node 9:
    - Neighbor nodes: 5, 6, 11, 10
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 9: 1 (9, 11, 5)

11. Central Node 10:
    - Neighbor nodes: 9, 6, 0
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 10: 0

12. Central Node 11:
    - Neighbor nodes: 9, 1, 3, 2, 0
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 11: 1 (11, 1, 3)

13. Central Node 12:
    - Neighbor nodes: 5, 8, 13, 14
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 12: 0

14. Central Node 13:
    - Neighbor nodes: 1, 8, 12, 4, 7
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 13: 1 (13, 1, 4)

15. Central Node 14:
    - Neighbor nodes: 5, 2, 7, 12
    - Number of 3-stars with central node 14: 0

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are: <4, 6, 13>, <5, 9, 12>, <5, 4, 14>, <5, 4, 6>, <9, 11, 5>, <11, 1, 3>, and <13, 1, 4>.
