Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star.
    - Nodes 4, 7, 14, and 17 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can be the center of a 3-star.
  
Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star.
    - For node 4: (4, 8, 19), (4, 8, 17), (4, 19, 17)
    - For node 7: (7, 12, 16)
    - For node 14: (14, 6, 5)
    - For node 17: (17, 13, 5), (17, 8, 19), (17, 19, 5)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
    - <4, (8, 19, 17)>, <4, (8, 4, 17)>, <7, (12, 16, 7)>, <14, (6, 14, 5)>, <17, (13, 17, 5)>, <17, (8, 17, 19)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.]
