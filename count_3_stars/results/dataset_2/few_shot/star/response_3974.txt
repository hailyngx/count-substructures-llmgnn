Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:

- <6, (2, 28, 22)>
- <9, (0, 3, 24)>
- <12, (5, 24, 17)>
- <14, (4, 7, 3)>
- <16, (21, 17, 3)>
- <18, (13, 25, 28)>
- <20, (27, 5, 19)>
- <22, (26, 28, 29)>
- <25, (18, 29, 25)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
