Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration and then count them. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

<3, (15, 16, 8)>
<14, (17, 11, 19)>
<5, (17, 2, 19)>

Now, we have listed all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's count how many of these configurations exist in total.
