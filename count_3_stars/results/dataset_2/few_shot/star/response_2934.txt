Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   <0, (9, 1, 6)>
   
2. For node 1:
   <1, (5, 3, 8)>
   <1, (7, 6, 0)>
   
3. For node 2:
   <2, (7, 3, 0)>
   
4. For node 3:
   <3, (9, 4, 8)>
   
5. For node 4:
   <4, (9, 7, 8)>
   
6. For node 6:
   <6, (7, 1, 8)>
   
7. For node 8:
   <8, (9, 4, 6)>
   
8. For node 9:
   <9, (8, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
