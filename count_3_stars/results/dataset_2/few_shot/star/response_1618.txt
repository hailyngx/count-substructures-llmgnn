Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Remember, in a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through each node and identify any 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star (Degree is 4)
- Node 1: No 3-star (Degree is 2)
- Node 2: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 3: No 3-star (Degree is 2)
- Node 4: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 5: <5, (9, 19, 12)>
- Node 6: No 3-star (Degree is 1)
- Node 7: <7, (11, 18, 16)>
- Node 8: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 9: <9, (5, 17, 1)>
- Node 10: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 11: <11, (14, 10, 3)>
- Node 12: <12, (5, 19, 4)>
- Node 13: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 14: No 3-star (Degree is 2)
- Node 15: No 3-star (Degree is 2)
- Node 16: <16, (13, 4, 7)>
- Node 17: No 3-star (Degree is 2)
- Node 18: No 3-star (Degree is 3)
- Node 19: No 3-star (Degree is 4)

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars as identified above.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 19, 12)>
<7, (11, 18, 16)>
<9, (5, 17, 1)>
<11, (14, 10, 3)>
<12, (5, 19, 4)>
