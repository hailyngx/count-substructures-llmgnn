Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 12, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 13, 12, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 14, 13, 12, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 11, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 14, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 11, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 14, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 0, 13, 5, and node 10

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 2, and 13. <9, (8, 2, 13)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 12, and 8. <1, (13, 12, 8)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 14. <5, (4, 0, 14)>
4. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 14. <13, (9, 1, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
