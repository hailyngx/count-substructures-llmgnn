Response:
The central nodes in the 3-stars can only be the nodes with degree 3. Let's identify them first:
- Nodes 6, 9, 10, and 13 have degree less than 3.
- Nodes 7 and 1 have degree 3, but they are not the centers of the 3-stars because they are leaves in the star configuration.
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, 11, and 12 have degree 6, 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5 respectively. These are potential central nodes for the 3-stars.

Now, let's examine the neighbors of these potential central nodes to see if they form 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: (8, 3, 4), (1, 4, 2), (10, 14, 0)
- Node 2: (11, 5, 1)
- Node 4: (3, 5, 12), (1, 5, 2)
- Node 8: (9, 14, 0)
- Node 11: (13, 3, 14), (7, 14, 11), (2, 5, 1), (11, 14, 7)
- Node 12: (9, 13, 3), (5, 13, 11)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 2)>
<0, (10, 14, 0)>
<4, (3, 5, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 2)>
<11, (13, 3, 14)>
<11, (7, 14, 11)>
<11, (2, 5, 1)>
<12, (9, 13, 3)>
(Note: Repeated 3-stars are not listed again)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
