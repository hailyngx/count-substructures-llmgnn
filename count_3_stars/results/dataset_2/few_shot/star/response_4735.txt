Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 17: <5, (9, 2, 17)>
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 1: <8, (9, 4, 1)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 14: <4, (8, 19, 14)>
4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 14: <2, (5, 1, 14)>
5. Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 1: <16, (5, 18, 1)>
6. Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 0: <17, (5, 18, 0)>
7. Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 14: <11, (4, 18, 14)>
8. Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 15, and 3: <19, (4, 15, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
