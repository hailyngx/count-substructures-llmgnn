Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (8, 16, 6)>
<2, (7, 12, 17)>
<3, (17, 18, 19)>
<4, (13, 15, 8)>
<5, (15, 5, 14)>
<6, (8, 19, 1)>
<7, (0, 19, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 15)>
<9, (10, 18, 12)>
<10, (17, 10, 3)>
<11, (15, 6, 11)>
<12, (17, 2, 9)>
<13, (8, 17, 4)>
<14, (7, 5, 14)>
<15, (8, 15, 4)>
<16, (0, 19, 16)>
<17, (13, 10, 3)>
<18, (9, 3, 12)>
<19, (7, 3, 16)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
