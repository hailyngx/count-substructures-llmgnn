Response:
Following the rules of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the adjacency list, we observe that there are no nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Hence, there are no 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [0].
