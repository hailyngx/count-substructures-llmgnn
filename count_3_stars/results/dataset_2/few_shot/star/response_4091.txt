Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify and count the number of 3-stars in the given graph using the information provided.

1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
   
   Nodes with degree 3 can be central nodes in 3-stars. 
   
   - From the given adjacency list:
   
     Nodes 4 and 7 have degree 4.
   
     Nodes 2 and 8 have degree 5.
   
     All other nodes have degree 3 (1, 3, 5, 6, 9 have degree 3).
   
   - Nodes with degree 3: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
   
   - For each node with degree 3, identify the adjacent nodes connected to it:
   
     - Node 1: Connected to 5 and 6
     - Node 3: Connected to 6, 0, 2
     - Node 5: Connected to 1, 4
     - Node 6: Connected to 9, 1, 7
     - Node 9: Connected to 6, 8, 2
   
   - Based on the connections, the 3-stars can be formed as follows:
   
     <1, (5, 6)>
     <3, (6, 0, 2)>
     <5, (1, 4)>
     <6, (9, 1, 7)>
     <9, (6, 8, 2)>

2. Count the total number of 3-stars: 5
