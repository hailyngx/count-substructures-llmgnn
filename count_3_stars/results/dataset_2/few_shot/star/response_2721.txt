Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph step by step:

1. Check each node and see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, then we have a 3-star with that node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (16, 10, 7)>
<1, (11, 8, 6)>
<2, (16, 0, 19)>
<3, (11, 0, 13)>
<4, (5, 19, 11)>
<5, (4, 17, 19)>
<6, (1, 18, 13)>
<7, (12, 0, 14)>
<8, (9, 1, 17)>
<9, (8, 17, 18)>
<10, (17, 0, 14)>
<11, (3, 1, 19)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (12, 1, 3)>
<14, (10, 7, 15)>
<15, (18, 14, 6)>
<16, (0, 2, 19)>
<17, (5, 9, 10)>
<18, (17, 3, 15)>
<19, (11, 4, 2)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find there are 20 such 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
