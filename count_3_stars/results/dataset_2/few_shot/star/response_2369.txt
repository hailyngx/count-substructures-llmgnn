Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

A 3-star with central node 1:
- (1, 18, 5, 10)
<1, (18, 5, 10)>

A 3-star with central node 4:
- (4, 10, 16, 6)
<4, (10, 16, 6)>

A 3-star with central node 5:
- (5, 19, 1, 17)
<5, (19, 1, 17)>

A 3-star with central node 6:
- (6, 7, 17, 16)
<6, (7, 17, 16)>

A 3-star with central node 7:
- (7, 19, 14, 9)
<7, (19, 14, 9)>

A 3-star with central node 8:
- (8, 13, 14, 17)
<8, (13, 14, 17)>

A 3-star with central node 9:
- (9, 7, 13, 19)
<9, (7, 13, 19)>

A 3-star with central node 10:
- (10, 4, 14, 1)
<10, (4, 14, 1)>

A 3-star with central node 11:
- (11, 14, 0, 2)
<11, (14, 0, 2)>

A 3-star with central node 17:
- (17, 8, 18, 5)
<17, (8, 18, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
