Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. This node will be considered as the central node of a 3-star.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 11 is connected to 3 other nodes: 28, 8, 12
- Node 16 is connected to 3 other nodes: 21, 25, 5
- Node 20 is connected to 3 other nodes: 25, 26, 1
- Node 25 is connected to 3 other nodes: 16, 20, 5
- Node 22 is connected to 3 other nodes: 23, 2, 19
- Node 12 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 27, 2
- Node 21 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 13, 15
- Node 13 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 28, 21
- Node 15 is connected to 3 other nodes: 19, 21, 26
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 11, 20, 1
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 28, 14, 3
- Node 14 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 3, 24
- Node 27 is connected to 3 other nodes: 12, 1, 0
- Node 19 is connected to 3 other nodes: 25, 22, 15
- Node 26 is connected to 3 other nodes: 20, 15, 6

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<11, (28, 8, 12)>
<16, (21, 25, 5)>
<20, (25, 26, 1)>
<25, (16, 20, 5)>
<22, (23, 2, 19)>
<12, (17, 27, 2)>
<21, (17, 13, 15)>
<13, (4, 28, 21)>
<15, (19, 21, 26)>
<8, (11, 20, 1)>
<9, (28, 14, 3)>
<14, (9, 3, 24)>
<27, (12, 1, 0)>
<19, (25, 22, 15)>
<26, (20, 15, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
