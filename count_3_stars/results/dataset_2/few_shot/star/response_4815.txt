Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6)

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list them, let's first identify the central node and the leaf nodes of each potential 3-star based on the given graph representation.

1. Node 0: (9, 3, 8)
    Potential 3-star: (0, 9, 3, 8)
2. Node 1: (4, 8) 
    No 3-stars can be formed around node 1.
3. Node 2: (5, 9, 3, 6)
    Potential 3-stars: 
    <2, (5, 9, 3)>
    <2, (3, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: (9, 7, 0, 2, 8)
    No 3-stars can be formed around node 3.
5. Node 4: (5, 7, 8, 1, 6)
    Potential 3-star: (4, 5, 7, 8)
6. Node 5: (9, 2, 4)
    Potential 3-star: (5, 9, 2, 4)
7. Node 6: (4, 8, 2)
    Potential 3-star: (6, 4, 8, 2)
8. Node 7: (9, 4, 3)
    No 3-stars can be formed around node 7.
9. Node 8: (9, 4, 1, 3, 0, 6)
    No 3-stars can be formed around node 8.
10. Node 9: (5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 0)
    No 3-stars can be formed around node 9.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, and <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
