Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying each valid 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars and count them:

1. Go through each node and check if it has exactly three neighbors. If it does, then it is the center of a potential 3-star.
2. For each potential center node, check if its neighbors are connected among themselves. If they are, then it forms a valid 3-star.
3. Count the total unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

The potential 3-star centers are nodes: 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, 14.

For node 5:
- (5, 9, 4, 1) forms a 3-star. <5, (9, 4, 1)>
- (5, 9, 0, 7) forms a 3-star. <5, (9, 0, 7)>
- (5, 1, 7, 0) forms a 3-star. <5, (1, 7, 0)>
- (5, 14, 2, 4) forms a 3-star. <5, (14, 2, 4)>

For node 4:
- (4, 9, 7, 8) forms a 3-star. <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- (4, 7, 8, 0) forms a 3-star. <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- (4, 0, 6, 10) forms a 3-star. <4, (0, 6, 10)>

For node 7:
- (7, 5, 9, 8) forms a 3-star. <7, (5, 9, 8)>
- (7, 4, 11, 0) forms a 3-star. <7, (4, 11, 0)>

For node 1:
- (1, 5, 3, 10) forms a 3-star. <1, (5, 3, 10)>
- (1, 14, 2, 8) forms a 3-star. <1, (14, 2, 8)>

For node 0:
- (0, 5, 11, 2) forms a 3-star. <0, (5, 11, 2)>
- (0, 11, 14, 3) forms a 3-star. <0, (11, 14, 3)>
- (0, 2, 10, 6) forms a 3-star. <0, (2, 10, 6)>

For node 14:
- (14, 5, 11, 2) forms a 3-star. <14, (5, 11, 2)>
- (14, 1, 3, 2) forms a 3-star. <14, (1, 3, 2)>

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 4, 1)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (14, 2, 4)>, 
<4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (0, 6, 10)>, 
<7, (5, 9, 8)>, <7, (4, 11, 0)>, 
<1, (5, 3, 10)>, <1, (14, 2, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 11, 2)>, <0, (11, 14, 3)>, <0, (2, 10, 6)>, 
<14, (5, 11, 2)>, <14, (1, 3, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
