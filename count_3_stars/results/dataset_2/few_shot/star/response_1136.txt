Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 2: <2, (1, 18, 21)>
2. Node 4: <4, (7, 14, 29)>
3. Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 20)>
4. Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 18)>
5. Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 17)>
6. Node 11: <11, (10, 3, 14)>
7. Node 13: <13, (12, 16, 20)>
8. Node 15: <15, (4, 25, 19)>
9. Node 16: <16, (13, 25, 14)>
10. Node 17: <17, (9, 11, 22)>
11. Node 18: <18, (2, 8, 7)>
12. Node 19: <19, (1, 15, 28)>
13. Node 20: <20, (6, 13, 3)>
14. Node 21: <21, (6, 2, 7)>
15. Node 22: <22, (14, 17, 2)>
16. Node 23: <23, (27, 29, 4)>
17. Node 25: <25, (26, 16, 15)>
18. Node 26: <26, (10, 12, 25)>
19. Node 28: <28, (19, 0, 12)>
20. Node 29: <29, (23, 4, 0)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we get: [20]
