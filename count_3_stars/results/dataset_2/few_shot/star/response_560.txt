Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list them, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected by edges to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if a node is connected to exactly three other nodes that are not connected to each other.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
