Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the central node for each 3-star can connect to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 1, 18)>
<0, (2, 6, 12)>
<0, (6, 7, 13)>
<2, (10, 18, 12)>
<2, (10, 12, 6)>
<2, (18, 4, 15)>
<2, (18, 1, 0)>
<6, (8, 4, 12)>
<6, (8, 12, 15)>
<7, (16, 17, 15)>
<7, (16, 12, 13)>
<12, (17, 9, 15)>
<12, (17, 2, 6)>
<13, (14, 19, 15)>
<13, (14, 15, 7)>
<15, (18, 1, 13)>
<15, (18, 7, 12)>
<18, (4, 8, 15)>
<18, (1, 0, 2)>
<19, (14, 9, 13)>
<19, (14, 13, 7)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
