Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars around each node and summing them up. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: <1, (5, 8, 14)>.
- Node 2: <2, (9, 7, 13)>.
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 10)>.
- Node 5: <5, (13, 8, 1)>.
- Node 6: No 3-stars.
- Node 7: <7, (4, 12, 13)>.
- Node 8: <8, (5, 12, 14)>.
- Node 9: No 3-stars.
- Node 10: No 3-stars.
- Node 11: No 3-stars.
- Node 12: No 3-stars.
- Node 13: <13, (5, 7, 12)>.
- Node 14: <14, (1, 12, 8)>.

Counting the 3-stars around each node, we find 7 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 8, 14)>, <2, (9, 7, 13)>, <4, (9, 7, 10)>, <5, (13, 8, 1)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <8, (5, 12, 14)>, and <14, (1, 12, 8)>.
