Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14)

Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 1, 12, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 11, 7, and node 4
Node 13 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 11, 8, 5, 0, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star in the given graph. A 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. From the adjacency list, we can see the following nodes can act as the center of a 3-star: 6, 1, 3, 14, and 11.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<6, (5, 3, 14)>
<1, (9, 10, 11)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<14, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 14, 12)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars in the graph, we find there are [5] 3-stars in total.
