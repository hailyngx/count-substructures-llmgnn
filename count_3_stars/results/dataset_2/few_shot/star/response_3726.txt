Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, the possible 3-stars are as follows:
1. <0, (4, 7, 3)>
2. <1, (7, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (6, 0, 0)>
4. <3, (4, 1, 0)>
5. <4, (7, 0, 3)>
6. <5, (7, 1, 3)>
7. <6, (9, 5, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 9)>
9. <8, (6, 9, 5)>
10. <9, (7, 1, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is 10. So, the answer is [10].
