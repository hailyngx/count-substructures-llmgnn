Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with 3 connections as follows:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 2
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 0

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as potential central nodes and counting the number of valid 3-stars around them.

Counting the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
