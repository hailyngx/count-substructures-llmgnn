Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances correspond to 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go through the nodes one by one and identify the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0** is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 6.
   - 3-star: <0, (11, 13, 6)>

2. **Node 1** is connected to nodes 2 and 0, which is not a 3-star.

3. **Node 2** is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 3.
   - 3-star: <2, (4, 10, 3)>

4. **Node 3** is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 5.
   - 3-star: <3, (7, 11, 5)>

5. **Node 4** is connected to nodes 2 and 10, which is not a 3-star.

6. **Node 5** is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 13.
   - 3-star: <5, (7, 10, 13)>

7. **Node 6** is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 12.
   - 3-star: <6, (13, 14, 12)>

8. **Node 7** is connected to nodes 12, 3, and 14.
   - 3-star: <7, (12, 3, 14)>

9. **Node 8** is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 14.
   - 3-star: <8, (10, 11, 14)>

10. **Node 9** is connected to nodes 2 and 14, which is not a 3-star.

11. **Node 10** is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 5.
   - 3-star: <10, (4, 11, 5)>

12. **Node 11** is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 0.
   - 3-star: <11, (10, 3, 0)>

13. **Node 12** is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 13.
   - 3-star: <12, (7, 11, 13)>

14. **Node 13** is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 0.
   - 3-star: <13, (5, 12, 0)>

15. **Node 14** is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 6.
   - 3-star: <14, (7, 8, 6)>

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 13, 6)>, <2, (4, 10, 3)>, <3, (7, 11, 5)>, <5, (7, 10, 13)>, <6, (13, 14, 12)>, <7, (12, 3, 14)>, <8, (10, 11, 14)>, <10, (4, 11, 5)>, <11, (10, 3, 0)>, <12, (7, 11, 13)>, <13, (5, 12, 0)>, <14, (7, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
