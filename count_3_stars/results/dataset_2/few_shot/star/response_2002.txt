Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars one by one.

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 9)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
10. <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
