Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 14, 7, 12, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, 11, 13, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, 13, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 12, 5, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 13, 5, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 8, 0, 13, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 5, 12, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 10, 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <3, (1, 0, 5)>
2. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
5. <5, (3, 1, 7)>
6. <5, (3, 10, 11)>
7. <0, (3, 7, 14)>
8. <7, (5, 1, 9)>
9. <7, (5, 9, 11)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 7)>
11. <9, (1, 5, 13)>
12. <9, (4, 7, 13)>
13. <10, (5, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
