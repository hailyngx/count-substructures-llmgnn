Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (16, 17, 11)>
<0, (16, 17, 4)>
<0, (17, 18, 6)>
<2, (3, 11, 13)>
<2, (3, 6, 19)>
<2, (4, 19, 0)>
<3, (13, 2, 6)>
<3, (19, 6, 3)>
<5, (15, 7, 5)>
<5, (19, 4, 5)>
<6, (17, 7, 18)>
<9, (16, 10, 9)>
<10, (19, 12, 10)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
