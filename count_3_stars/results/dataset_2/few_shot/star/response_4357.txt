Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars.

From the given adjacency list:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 20, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 21, 18, and 22.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 28, 7, and 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 14, and 1.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 28, 3, and 2.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 23.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 29, and 23.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 10, 24.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 10, 29.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 7, 20, 25, and 19.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 21, 0, and 18.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 26, 27, and 23.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 25, 8, and 13.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 4, 25, and 5.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 11, 16.

Now, let's pair up each central node with its leaf nodes to form 3-stars:
- <9, (2, 20, 0)>
- <10, (21, 18, 22)>
- <11, (28, 7, 4)>
- <12, (17, 14, 1)>
- <16, (28, 3, 2)>
- <18, (10, 7, 17)>
- <19, (6, 3, 23)>
- <20, (9, 1, 29)>
- <21, (10, 24)>
- <22, (10, 29)>
- <23, (7, 20, 25)>
- <24, (21, 0, 18)>
- <25, (26, 27, 23)>
- <26, (25, 8, 13)>
- <27, (4, 25, 5)>
- <28, (11, 16)>

There are a total of 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So the final answer is: [16]
