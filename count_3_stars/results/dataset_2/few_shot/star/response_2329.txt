Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Possible 3-star configurations:
1. Node 8: (2, 29, 14)
2. Node 9: (26, 11, 3)
3. Node 13: (22, 5, 6)
4. Node 15: (20, 10, 19)
5. Node 21: (28, 16, 25)
6. Node 22: (24, 17, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
<8, (2, 29, 14)>
<9, (26, 11, 3)>
<13, (22, 5, 6)>
<15, (20, 10, 19)>
<21, (28, 16, 25)>
<22, (24, 17, 8)>
