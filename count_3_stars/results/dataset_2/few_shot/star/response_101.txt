Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition given.

From the adjacency list, we can see the possible 3-stars involving each node:
- Node 0: (0, 5, 1), (0, 1, 7), (0, 4, 6), (0, 7, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 5, 0), (1, 5, 3), (1, 5, 7), (1, 3, 2), (1, 3, 5)
- Node 2: No 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors
- Node 3: (3, 5, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 5, 1)
- Node 4: (4, 6, 7), (4, 6, 8), (4, 8, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 0), (5, 1, 3), (5, 0, 1)
- Node 6: (6, 9, 8), (6, 9, 7), (6, 4, 7), (6, 4, 8), (6, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 9, 8), (7, 8, 9), (7, 9, 6), (7, 6, 4), (7, 4, 8), (7, 4, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 9, 6), (8, 9, 7), (8, 6, 4), (8, 6, 7), (8, 4, 7), (8, 4, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 6, 7), (9, 7, 8), (9, 6, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Using the list above, we can see that the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 1, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
