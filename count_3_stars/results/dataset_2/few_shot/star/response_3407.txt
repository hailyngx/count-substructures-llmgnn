Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. Then we check if each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 17, 8, 28, and 1. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 8, and 28)
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 10, and 0. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 0)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 20, 18, 1, and 11. (No 3-star)
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 25 and 26. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 4: Connected to node 11. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 23 and 24. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 14, 22, 18, and 13. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 22, and 18)
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 15, 18, 9, and 19. (No 3-star)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 29 and 0. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 25 and 7. (No 3-star)
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 14, 21, 1, 13, and 19. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 21, and 19)
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 4 and 2. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 28, 29, and 20. (No 3-star)
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 6, 10, 21, and 23. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 21, and 23)
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 16, and 10. (It forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 16, and 10)
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 20, 7, and 24. (No 3-star)
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 14, 24, 19, and 27. (No 3-star)
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 28 and 0. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 25, 6, 2, and 7. (No 3-star)
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 10, 16, and 7. (No 3-star)
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 29, 15, 12, and 2. (No 3-star)
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 10, 27, and 13. (No 3-star)
- Node 22: Connected to node 6. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 5, and 13. (No 3-star)
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 15, 16, and 5. (No 3-star)
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 3, 9, 26, and 18. (No 3-star)
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 3, 25, and 27. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 21, 26, and 16. (Does not form a 3-star)
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 17, 0, and 12. (No 3-star)
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 8, 20, and 12. (No 3-star)

We found the following 3-stars:
- <0, (17, 8, 28)>
- <1, (2, 10, 0)>
- <6, (14, 22, 18)>
- <10, (14, 21, 19)>
- <13, (6, 21, 23)>
- <14, (6, 16, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
