Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above:

[6]
