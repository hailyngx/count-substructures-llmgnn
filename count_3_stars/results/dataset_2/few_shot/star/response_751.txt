Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (8, 7, 10)>
<1, (0, 10, 11)>
<2, (5, 9, 13)>
<3, (4, 14, 3)>
<4, (8, 10, 11)>
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<6, (13, 4, 10)>
<7, (9, 0, 14)>
<8, (13, 4, 10)>
<9, (5, 2, 14)>
<10, (8, 4, 0)>
<11, (5, 4, 0)>
<12, (9, 13, 11)>
<13, (5, 8, 12)>
<14, (9, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
