Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 12)>
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<6, (5)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<10, (13, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 14)>
<10, (13, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 14)>
<12, (3, 0)>
<13, (1, 3, 10)>
<14, (9, 10, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [14] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
