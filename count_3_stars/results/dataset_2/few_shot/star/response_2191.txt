Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 connections are:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 8

Now, let's look at the connections of these nodes to find the 3-stars:

- For Node 0:
    - <0, (9, 1, 14)>
- For Node 2:
    - <2, (1, 4, 12)>
- For Node 5:
    - <5, (1, 11, 12)>
- For Node 8:
    - <8, (13, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
