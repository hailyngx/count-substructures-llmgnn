Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are specifically connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-star structures we find are:
<0, (14, 3, 15)>
<2, (10, 14, 20)>
<3, (11, 22, 26)>
<4, (8, 18, 9)>
<6, (4, 28, 18)>
<9, (4, 20, 2)>
<9, (4, 20, 2)>
<12, (11, 27, 13)>
<13, (12, 3, 9)>
<18, (4, 14, 23)>
<20, (8, 28, 9)>
<24, (18, 23, 6)>
<25, (23, 1, 5)>

So, there are a total of [13] 3-star structures in the given graph.
