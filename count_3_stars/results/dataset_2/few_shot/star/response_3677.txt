Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we should look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list them:
  
Node 4: (5, 6, 2)
Node 6: (9, 8, 4)
Node 1: (4, 8, 7)
Node 7: (8, 0, 3)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.
