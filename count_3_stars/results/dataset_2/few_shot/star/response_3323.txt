Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we know that the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 2, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19.

    - Node 1: 6, 10, 17
    - Possible 3-stars with node 1 as the central node:
        - <1, (6, 7, 10)>
        - <1, (10, 18, 17)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 1 as the central node: 2

    - Node 2: 12, 15, 14
    - Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the central node:
        - <2, (12, 9, 15)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 2 as the central node: 1

    - Node 8: 11, 0, 18
    - Possible 3-stars with node 8 as the central node:
        - <8, (11, 4, 18)>
        - <8, (0, 19, 18)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 8 as the central node: 2

    - Node 10: 18, 1
    - Possible 3-stars with node 10 as the central node:
        - <10, (18, 14, 1)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 10 as the central node: 1

    - Node 12: 9
    - No 3-star can be formed with node 12 as the central node.

    - Node 16: 7, 13
    - Possible 3-stars with node 16 as the central node:
        - <16, (7, 6, 13)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 16 as the central node: 1

    - Node 18: 10, 8, 1, 14
    - Possible 3-stars with node 18 as the central node:
        - <18, (10, 1, 8)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 18 as the central node: 1

    - Node 19: 4, 0
    - Possible 3-stars with node 19 as the central node:
        - <19, (4, 13, 0)>
    - Total 3-stars with node 19 as the central node: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8]
