Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. 

The central nodes in this graph are: 6, 8, 13

For central node 6:
Connected nodes: 9, 10, 2, 8, 4, 13
Possible 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 2, 4)>
- <6, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (9, 8, 4)>
- <6, (9, 8, 13)>
- <6, (10, 13, 2)>
Total = 5

For central node 8:
Connected nodes: 6, 13, 2, 5, 12, 3
Possible 3-stars:
- <8, (6, 2, 13)>
- <8, (6, 13, 3)>
- <8, (13, 2, 5)>
- <8, (13, 1, 0)>
- <8, (13, 1, 12)>
Total = 5

For central node 13:
Connected nodes: 6, 8, 2, 1, 10, 0
Possible 3-stars:
- <13, (6, 2, 8)>
- <13, (6, 2, 10)>
- <13, (6, 8, 0)>
- <13, (6, 8, 1)>
Total = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

<6, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 8, 13)>
<6, (10, 13, 2)>
<8, (6, 2, 13)>
<8, (6, 13, 3)>
<8, (13, 2, 5)>
<8, (13, 1, 0)>
<8, (13, 1, 12)>
<13, (6, 2, 8)>
<13, (6, 2, 10)>
<13, (6, 8, 0)>
<13, (6, 8, 1)>
