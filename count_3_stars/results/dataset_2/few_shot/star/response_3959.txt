Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-stars:

<8, (9, 27, 1)>
<1, (6, 23, 11)>
<2, (13, 28, 21)>
<9, (12, 29, 8)>
<6, (1, 13, 28)>
<10, (4, 5, 7)>
<11, (1, 7, 19)>
<12, (9, 15, 20)>
<13, (2, 6, 14)>
<14, (13, 22, 8)>
<15, (5, 12, 24)>
<16, (10, 18, 28)>
<17, (0, 4, 24)>
<18, (6, 16, 25)>
<19, (3, 11, 26)>
<20, (12, 21, 22)>
<21, (2, 13, 20)>
<22, (14, 20, 29)>
<24, (4, 17, 25)>
<25, (18, 23, 24)>
<26, (19, 27, 29)>
<27, (0, 8, 26)>
<28, (2, 16, 6)>
<29, (9, 22, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
