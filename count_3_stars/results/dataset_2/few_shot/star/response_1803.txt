Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of 3-stars centered at each node and then summing them up. 

Let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
1. Node 0: 1 3-star <0, (4, 6, 12)>
2. Node 1: 0 3-stars
3. Node 2: 0 3-stars
4. Node 3: 2 3-stars <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 14, 7)>
5. Node 4: 0 3-stars
6. Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (9, 13, 7)>
7. Node 6: 0 3-stars
8. Node 7: 0 3-stars
9. Node 8: 0 3-stars
10. Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (5, 13, 3)>
11. Node 10: 0 3-stars
12. Node 11: 1 3-star <11, (8, 1, 12)>
13. Node 12: 1 3-star <12, (9, 2, 6)>
14. Node 13: 0 3-stars
15. Node 14: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 12)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 14, 7)>, <5, (9, 13, 7)>, <9, (5, 13, 3)>, and <11, (8, 1, 12)>.
