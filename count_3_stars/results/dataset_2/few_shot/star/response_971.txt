Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting with Node 0:
- 3-star: <0, (6, 3, 4)>
- 3-star: <0, (6, 5, 14)>

2. Moving to Node 1:
- 3-star: <1, (6, 4, 14)>

3. Moving to Node 2:
- 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 14)>
- 3-star: <2, (12, 5, 11)>

4. Moving to Node 3:
- 3-star: <3, (9, 7, 8)>
- 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 8)>

5. Moving to Node 4:
- 3-star: <4, (6, 0, 1)>
- 3-star: <4, (6, 5, 0)>
- 3-star: <4, (6, 10, 8)>

6. Moving to Node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (4, 0, 11)>
- 3-star: <5, (4, 12, 2)>

7. Moving to Node 6:
- 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- 3-star: <6, (0, 13, 14)>

8. Moving to Node 7:
- 3-star: <7, (3, 8, 10)>

9. Moving to Node 8:
- 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 10)>

10. Moving to Node 9:
- 3-star: <9, (3, 10, 4)>

11. Moving to Node 10:
- 3-star: <10, (9, 3, 4)>

12. Moving to Node 11:
- 3-star: <11, (12, 5, 14)>

13. Moving to Node 12:
- 3-star: <12, (8, 5, 11)>

14. Moving to Node 13:
- 3-star: <13, (0, 6, 14)>

15. Moving to Node 14:
- 3-star: <14, (0, 5, 11)>

In total, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
