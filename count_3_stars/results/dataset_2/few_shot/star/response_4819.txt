Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:
1. Node 2: (11, 18, 19) - <2, (11, 18, 19)>
2. Node 3: (10, 12, 19) - <3, (10, 12, 19)>
3. Node 4: (2, 1, 5) - <4, (2, 1, 5)>
4. Node 7: (12, 9, 17) - <7, (12, 9, 17)>
5. Node 9: (7, 13, 16) - <9, (7, 13, 16)>
6. Node 11: (14, 13, 2) - <11, (14, 13, 2)>
7. Node 12: (7, 16, 3) - <12, (7, 16, 3)>
8. Node 16: (12, 14, 9) - <16, (12, 14, 9)>
9. Node 17: (18, 7, 13) - <17, (18, 7, 13)>
10. Node 18: (2, 17, 15) - <18, (2, 17, 15)>
11. Node 19: (6, 1, 3) - <19, (6, 1, 3)>

By listing all unique 3-stars, we can see that there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
