Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go ahead and identify these 3-stars.

<0, (11, 6, 26)>
<2, (3, 4, 15)>
<3, (2, 23, 28)>
<4, (2, 22, 6)>
<6, (0, 21, 27)>
<8, (9, 14, 27)>
<12, (5, 17, 20)>
<13, (9, 10, 7)>
<15, (2, 10, 17)>
<17, (12, 15, 19)>
<18, (1, 26, 7)>
<19, (11, 12, 17)>
<22, (16, 23, 29)>
