Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1 (connected to 3, 14, 13, 4), 2 (connected to 4, 0, 7), 5 (connected to 3, 13, 0, 14), 7 (connected to 3, 2), 9 (connected to 3, 4, 12, 11), 11 (connected to 0, 14, 9), and 12 (connected to 4, 13, 14, 9).

Let's analyze the 3-stars using these nodes as the potential centers:

- For node 1: Available leaves are 3, 14, and 13. The 3-star here is <1, (3, 14, 13)>.
- For node 2: Available leaves are 4, 0, and 7. The 3-star here is <2, (4, 0, 7)>.
- For node 5: Available leaves are 3, 13, 0, and 14. The 3-stars here are <5, (3, 13, 0)> and <5, (3, 13, 14)>.
- For node 7: Available leaves are 3 and 2. However, there are not enough nodes for a 3-star.
- For node 9: Available leaves are 3, 4, 12, and 11. The 3-stars here are <9, (3, 4, 12)> and <9, (3, 4, 11)>.
- For node 11: Available leaves are 0, 14, and 9. The 3-star here is <11, (0, 14, 9)>.
- For node 12: Available leaves are 4, 13, 14, and 9. The 3-star here is <12, (4, 13, 14)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (3, 14, 13)>, <2, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (3, 13, 0)>, <5, (3, 13, 14)>, <9, (3, 4, 12)>, <9, (3, 4, 11)>, <11, (0, 14, 9)>, and <12, (4, 13, 14)>.

Count of 3-stars: [8]
