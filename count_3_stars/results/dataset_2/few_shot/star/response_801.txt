Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes forming a 3-star structure. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (29, 22, 23)>
<2, (29, 7, 1)>
<3, (28, 26, 13)>
<4, (24, 17, 26)>
<5, (19, 29, 5)>
<6, (29, 24, 8)>
<7, (29, 11, 5)>
<8, (25, 8, 10)>
<9, (15, 9, 22)>
<10, (8, 10, 5)>
<11, (21, 11, 19)>
<12, (28, 12, 5)>
<13, (3, 13, 0)>
<14, (17, 14, 21)>
<15, (9, 15, 17)>
<16, (25, 16, 20)>
<17, (24, 17, 14)>
<18, (18, 14, 12)>
<19, (29, 19, 1)>
<20, (25, 20, 16)>
<21, (19, 21, 14)>
<22, (9, 22, 1)>
<23, (27, 23, 1)>
<24, (17, 24, 26)>
<25, (8, 25, 20)>
<26, (15, 26, 24)>
<27, (23, 27)>
<28, (12, 28, 3)>
<29, (19, 29, 1)>

Thus, there are [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
