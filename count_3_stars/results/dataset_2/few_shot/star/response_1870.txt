Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list given, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (7, 3, 13)>
<2, (3, 8, 10)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (12, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 13, 0)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (0, 3, 14)>
<8, (3, 13, 2)>
<9, (3, 2, 11)>
<10, (13, 14, 2)>
<11, (1, 13, 12)>
<12, (4, 1, 14)>
<13, (1, 8, 5)>
<14, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (7, 3, 13)>
<2, (3, 8, 10)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (12, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 13, 0)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (0, 3, 14)>
<8, (3, 13, 2)>
<9, (3, 2, 11)>
<10, (13, 14, 2)>
<11, (1, 13, 12)>
<12, (4, 1, 14)>
<13, (1, 8, 5)>
