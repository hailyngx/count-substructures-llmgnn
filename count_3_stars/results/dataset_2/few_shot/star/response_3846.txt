Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the adjacency list:
- Node 5: 3-stars <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (7, 3, 8)>
- Node 9: 3-stars <9, (5, 3, 0)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 3: 3-stars <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (7, 1, 0)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 0: No 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
