Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 4, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 8, 1)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 0)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 4, 7)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
