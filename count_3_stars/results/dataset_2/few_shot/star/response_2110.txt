Response:
First, we notice that the graph is directed, meaning edges have not been considered as undirected pairs. To simplify the analysis, we will consider undirected pairs for this question.

Next, we identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all such 3-star patterns in the given graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 7, and 27: <2, (29, 7, 27)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 8: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 8: <6, (5, 9, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 28, and 27: <7, (29, 28, 27)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 22: <12, (4, 0, 22)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 29, and 3: <25, (2, 29, 3)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 7: <28, (2, 11, 7)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 26: <29, (2, 7, 26)>

Count of 3-star patterns found: 7
