Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present and then count them.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 0)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
