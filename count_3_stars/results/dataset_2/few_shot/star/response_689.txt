Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2)

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (9, 2, 10)>
2. <3, (1, 7, 13)>
3. <5, (10, 11, 12)>
4. <6, (4, 7, 12)>
5. <8, (10, 11, 12)>
6. <9, (1, 2, 13)>
7. <10, (1, 5, 11)>
8. <12, (5, 8, 10)>
9. <13, (9, 3, 14)>
10. <14, (0, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
