Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

    There are 4 possible 3-stars in the given graph. 
    Here they are listed uniquely:

    <0, (9, 4, 6)>
    <1, (9, 4, 7)>
    <2, (9, 4, 5)>
    <3, (7, 4, 8)>
