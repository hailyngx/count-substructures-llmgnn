Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's identify them step-by-step:

1. Looking at the adjacency list, we find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 (Connected to nodes 5, 3, 28)
   - Node 2 (Connected to nodes 28, 11, 24)
   - Node 5 (Connected to nodes 20, 6, 0)
   - Node 6 (Connected to nodes 20, 8, 5)
   - Node 7 (Connected to nodes 9, 16, 15)
   - Node 10 (Connected to nodes 6, 28, 22)
   - Node 11 (Connected to nodes 29, 14, 2)
   - Node 12 (Connected to nodes 13, 4, 15)
   - Node 13 (Connected to nodes 12, 24, 27)
   - Node 14 (Connected to nodes 21, 11, which is less than 3)
   - Node 15 (Connected to nodes 12, 7, which is less than 3)
   - Node 16 (Connected to only node 7, which is less than 3)
   - Node 17 (Connected to only nodes 4, 19, which is less than 3)
   - Node 18 (Connected to only nodes 26, 27, which is less than 3)
   - Node 19 (Connected to nodes 3, 12, 17)
   - Node 20 (Connected to nodes 29, 6, 5)
   - Node 21 (Connected to nodes 3, 26, 23)
   - Node 22 (Connected to nodes 26, 9, 4)
   - Node 23 (Connected to nodes 21, 29, 10)
   - Node 24 (Connected to nodes 13, 4, 2)
   - Node 26 (Connected to nodes 22, 18, 10)
   - Node 28 (Connected to nodes 0, 9, 10)
   - Node 29 (Connected to nodes 20, 9, 23)

2. Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (5, 3, 28)>
   - <2, (28, 11, 24)>
   - <5, (20, 6, 0)>
   - <6, (20, 8, 5)>
   - <19, (3, 12, 17)>
   - <21, (3, 26, 23)>
   - <22, (26, 9, 4)>
   - <23, (21, 29, 10)>
   - <26, (22, 18, 10)>
   - <28, (0, 10, 9)>
   - <29, (20, 9, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
