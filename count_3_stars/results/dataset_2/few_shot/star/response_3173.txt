Node 18 is connected to node 14, 4, 5, 16, and node 17
Node 19 is connected to node 7, 12, 15, and node 11

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are as follows:
1. <0, (8, 15, 19)>
2. <1, (16, 9, 17)>
3. <2, (6, 10, 5)>
4. <4, (14, 18, 11)>
5. <7, (16, 6, 13)>
6. <17, (18, 16, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
