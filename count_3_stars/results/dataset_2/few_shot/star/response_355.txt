Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 12, 10, 3, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 13, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 13, 0, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 14, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 13, 10, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 13, 6, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 6, 2, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 11, 3, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 6, and node 4

Response:
We will begin by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, 1. <0, (4, 12, 1)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, 0. <4, (5, 13, 0)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, 14. <6, (5, 1, 14)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, 10. <8, (5, 13, 10)>
5. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, 2. <13, (8, 4, 2)>
6. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 0, 11. <12, (9, 0, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
