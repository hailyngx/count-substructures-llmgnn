Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 neighbors and those neighbors are connected only to that node. These instances represent 3-stars.

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can identify the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (4, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (5, 8, 2)
3. Node 2: (4, 7, 1)
4. Node 3: (9, 4, 7)
5. Node 4: (5, 8, 2)
6. Node 5: (9, 6, 8)
7. Node 6: (5, 8, 1)
8. Node 7: (0, 3, 2)
9. Node 8: (5, 4, 6)
10. Node 9: (5, 3, 1)

Let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)> 

So, the final answer is [10].
