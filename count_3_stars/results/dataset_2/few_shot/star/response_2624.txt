Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to identify these 3-stars:

1. Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 13 (and node 18).
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 17 (and node 18).
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 3 (and 10).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 13 (and node 2).
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 0 (and node 18).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 3 (and 12).
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 9 (and 4).
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 15, 10 (and 16).
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 5, 14 (and 11).

2. Identify Unique 3-Stars:
- <0, (17, 8, 13)>
- <0, (17, 8, 18)>
- <1, (3, 17, 18)>
- <3, (1, 10, 13)>
- <8, (11, 0, 18)>
- <9, (13, 3, 12)>
- <12, (6, 9, 4)>
- <14, (6, 15, 16)>
- <15, (5, 14, 11)>

3. Count the Number of 3-Stars: 
- Total number of 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
