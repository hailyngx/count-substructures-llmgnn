Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph: 

First, we can identify the nodes with a degree of 3, as these nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. They are: 
- Node 4 connected to nodes 16, 7, and 6
- Node 5 connected to nodes 11, 3, and 13
- Node 15 connected to nodes 0, 10, and 9

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 as the center: (4, 16, 7, 6) and (4, 16, 7, 8)
- Node 5 as the center: (5, 11, 3, 13)
- Node 15 as the center: (15, 0, 10, 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars: 
<4, (16, 7, 6)>
<4, (16, 7, 8)>
<5, (11, 3, 13)>
<15, (0, 10, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
