Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the adjacency list to identify the 3-stars one by one:
1. Node 0: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 4 other nodes.
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
3. Node 2: 3-star found <2, (17, 18, 19)>
4. Node 3: Not a 3-star since it is connected to only 1 other node.
5. Node 4: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
7. Node 6: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
8. Node 7: 3-star found <7, (14, 17, 1)>
9. Node 8: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 2 other nodes.
10. Node 9: 3-star found <9, (14, 13, 8)>
11. Node 10: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
12. Node 11: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
13. Node 12: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
14. Node 13: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 2 other nodes.
15. Node 14: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 4 other nodes.
16. Node 15: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
17. Node 16: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
18. Node 17: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 5 other nodes.
19. Node 18: Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
20. Node 19: Not a 3-star since it is connected to only 1 other node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (17, 18, 19)> and <7, (14, 17, 1)>.
