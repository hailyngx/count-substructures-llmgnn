Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (8, 4, 19)>
<0, (8, 10, 19)>
<0, (4, 16, 19)>
<0, (10, 2, 5)>
<1, (11, 16, 5)>
<3, (15, 9, 5)>
<4, (8, 0, 16)>
<5, (3, 14, 10)>
<7, (15, 8, 19)>
<8, (13, 4, 0)>
<9, (3, 6, 17)>
<13, (9, 17, 8)>
<14, (19, 5, 14)>
<16, (17, 4, 1)>
<17, (9, 13, 16)>
<19, (11, 7, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
