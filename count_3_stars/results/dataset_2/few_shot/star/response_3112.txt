Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 8, 14, 2
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 14, 13
- Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 11 is connected to 2 nodes.

2. For the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 8, 14, 2), (0, 8, 6, 14)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 14, 13)
- Node 14: (14, 11, 6, 2), (14, 1, 4, 2)

3. Calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (8, 14, 2)>
- <0, (8, 6, 14)>
- <1, (4, 14, 13)>
- <14, (11, 6, 2)>
- <14, (1, 4, 2)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
