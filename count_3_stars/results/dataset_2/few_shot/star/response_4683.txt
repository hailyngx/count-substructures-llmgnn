Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

- For node 6: <6, (1, 4, 13)>
- For node 9: <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- For node 8: <8, (9, 4, 13)>
- For node 13: <13, (6, 8, 10)>
- For node 3: <3, (9, 7, 12)>
- For node 11: <11, (6, 7, 14)>
- For node 1: <1, (6, 9, 14)>
- For node 10: <10, (13, 14, 5)>
- For node 2: <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- For node 5: <5, (10, 11, 12)>
- For node 4: <4, (8, 9, 6)>
- For node 12: <12, (8, 5, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
