Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern around it.

Given the adjacency information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
