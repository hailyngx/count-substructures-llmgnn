Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information:

1. From node 0: <0, (27, 14, 13)>
2. From node 27: <27, (0, 21, 10)>
3. From node 4: <4, (7, 12, 24)>
4. From node 7: <7, (4, 25, 19)>
5. From node 3: <3, (25, 10, 9)>
6. From node 2: <2, (29, 28)>
7. From node 8: <8, (14, 12, 18)>
8. From node 13: <13, (0, 21, 15)>
9. From node 21: <21, (27, 13, 28)>
10. From node 26: <26, (27, 22, 15)>
11. From node 14: <14, (0, 8, 18)>
