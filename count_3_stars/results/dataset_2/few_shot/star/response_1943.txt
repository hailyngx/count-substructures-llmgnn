Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 2, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, 14, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 11, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 11, 13, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 13, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 8, 13, 1, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 4, 10, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 14)>
<1, (11, 2, 12)>
<2, (4, 7, 14)>
<3, (5, 4, 12)>
<4, (9, 7, 13)>
<5, (12, 11, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 11)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
