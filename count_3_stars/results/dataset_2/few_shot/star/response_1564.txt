Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 1, Node 5, and Node 12 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 14, and Node 15 have more than 3 neighbors, so they cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.
- Nodes 2, 9, 10, 16, and 18 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.

Next, we will construct the 3-stars using each of these potential central nodes and count the total number of unique 3-stars formed.

The 3-stars in the given graph with the central nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- <2, (7, 6, 1)>
- <9, (17, 16, 11)>
- <10, (17, 6, 1)>
- <16, (17, 0, 3)>
- <18, (8, 7, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
