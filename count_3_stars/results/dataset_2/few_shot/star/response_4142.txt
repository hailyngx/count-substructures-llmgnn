Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars for each node and then summing them up.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 1
- Node 23: 0
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: 1
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 1
- Node 28: 1
- Node 29: 1

Summing them up, we get a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
