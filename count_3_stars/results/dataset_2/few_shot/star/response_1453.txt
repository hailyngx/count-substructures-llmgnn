Response:
The first step is to identify 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's go node by node and look for 3-stars involving each node:

- For Node 0: <0, (21, 17, 26)>
- For Node 1: <1, (17, 6, 3)>
- For Node 2: <2, (29, 12, 21)>
- For Node 3: <3, (27, 12, 22)>
- For Node 4: <4, (9, 27, 22)>
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 25, 16)>
- For Node 6: <6, (15, 8, 13)>
- For Node 7: <7, (12, 14, 26)>
- For Node 8: No 3-stars
- For Node 9: <9, (15, 5, 4)>
- For Node 10: No 3-stars
- For Node 11: <11, (14)>
- For Node 12: <12, (3, 2, 7)>
- For Node 13: <13, (26, 6)>
- For Node 14: <14, (15, 7, 11)>
- For Node 15: <15, (9, 6, 25)>
- For Node 16: <16, (5, 22, 19)>
- For Node 17: <17, (0, 1, 18)>
- For Node 18: <18, (17, 14, 24)>
- For Node 19: <19, (28, 16)>
- For Node 20: No 3-stars
- For Node 21: <21, (2, 0, 28)>
- For Node 22: <22, (3, 12, 4)>
- For Node 23: <23, (29, 20, 24)>
- For Node 24: <24, (22, 18, 23)>
- For Node 25: <25, (15, 29, 5)>
- For Node 26: <26, (13, 0, 7)>
- For Node 27: <27, (3, 12, 4)>
- For Node 28: <28, (21, 19)>
- For Node 29: <29, (2, 25, 23)>

Now we need to count the total number of 3-stars. 

There are 14 unique 3-stars. The list below shows the unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (21, 17, 26)>
<1, (17, 6, 3)>
<2, (29, 12, 21)>
<3, (27, 12, 22)>
<4, (9, 27, 22)>
<5, (9, 25, 16)>
<6, (15, 8, 13)>
<7, (12, 14, 26)>
<9, (15, 5, 4)>
<11, (14)>
<12, (3, 2, 7)>
<13, (26, 6)>
<14, (15, 7, 11)>
<16, (5, 22, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
