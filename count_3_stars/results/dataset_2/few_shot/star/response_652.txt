Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Identify the central nodes: 
    - Node 3 has 5 adjacent nodes, so it can be a central node.
    - Node 6 has 4 adjacent nodes, so it can be a central node.
    - Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes, so it can be a central node.
    - Node 8 has 5 adjacent nodes, so it can be a central node.

2. For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - For Node 3:
        - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7.
        - Nodes 9, 4, and 7 are connected to Node 3 forming a 3-star.
        - So, <3, (9, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.

   - For Node 6:
        - Node 6 is not a central node of any 3-star since it only has 3 nodes connected to it.

   - For Node 1:
        - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
        - Nodes 5, 7, and 8 are not all connected to Node 1 to form a 3-star.

   - For Node 8:
        - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1.
        - Nodes 5, 4, and 1 are not all connected to Node 8 to form a 3-star.
        - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 0.
        - Nodes 4, 3, and 0 are connected to Node 8 forming a 3-star.
        - So, <8, (4, 3, 0)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.  
So, the answer is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (9, 4, 7)> and <8, (4, 3, 0)>.
