Node 18 is connected to node 19, 14, 17, and node 3
Node 19 is connected to node 1, 18, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Examining the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
- <2, (8, 5, 17)>
- <3, (8, 9, 18)>
- <6, (19, 11, 17)>
- <7, (9, 13, 8)>
- <8, (7, 2, 3)>
- <9, (7, 3, 13)>
- <11, (12, 14, 6)>
- <12, (0, 11, 15)>
- <13, (7, 4, 9)>
- <14, (1, 18, 11)>
- <15, (0, 12, 15)>
- <16, (5, 17, 16)>
- <17, (2, 5, 18)>
- <18, (19, 14, 17)>
- <19, (1, 18, 3)>
  
There are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
