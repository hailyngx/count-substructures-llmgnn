Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found:

1. <1, (21, 29, 9)>
2. <2, (22, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (13, 5, 15)>
4. <4, (23, 2, 6)>
5. <5, (3, 22, 20)>
6. <6, (16, 14, 2)>
7. <7, (21, 29, 19)>
8. <8, (0, 17, 0)>
9. <9, (1, 14, 1)>
10. <10, (21, 22, 15)>
11. <11, (16, 15, 20)>
12. <12, (29, 24, 18)>
13. <13, (3, 15, 18)>
14. <14, (21, 6, 9)>
15. <15, (11, 22, 13)>
16. <16, (11, 24, 6)>
17. <17, (29, 0, 0)>
18. <18, (23, 12, 25)>
