Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
To form a 3-star, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 14, 1)>
<5, (3, 4, 10)>
<5, (4, 11, 14)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<5, (9, 10, 14)>
<7, (1, 10, 11)>
<7, (1, 12, 2)>
<7, (2, 10, 11)>
<7, (2, 12, 1)>
<12, (2, 6, 13)>
<12, (6, 3, 4)>
<12, (6, 4, 5)>
<13, (0, 12, 14)>
<14, (0, 13, 5)>
<14, (0, 13, 12)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we have a total of [14].
