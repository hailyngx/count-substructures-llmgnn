Response:
To count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (8, 7, 16)>
2. <1, (17, 4, 16)>
3. <3, (17, 18, 7)>
4. <4, (8, 1, 15)>
5. <5, (14, 12, 15)>
6. <6, (10, 11, 6)>
7. <8, (14, 4, 15)>
8. <9, (11, 15, 9)>
9. <10, (6, 1, 10)>
10. <11, (17, 6, 9)>
11. <12, (5, 3, 12)>
12. <13, (18, 19, 13)>
13. <14, (17, 8, 5)>
14. <15, (4, 8, 9)>
15. <16, (8, 1, 19)>
16. <17, (14, 1, 11)>
17. <18, (3, 19, 13)>
18. <19, (13, 16, 18)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph gives us a total of 18 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
