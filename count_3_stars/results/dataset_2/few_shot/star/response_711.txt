Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars. 
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>

Now, as we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph, we can count the total number of 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
