Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. We will then count the unique 3-stars.

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can see from the adjacency list that the nodes and their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Leaves = [1]
- Node 1: Leaves = [16, 0, 8]
- Node 2: Leaves = [18, 19, 13]
- Node 3: Leaves = [5, 6, 8]
- Node 4: Leaves = [11, 16, 10]
- Node 5: Leaves = [9, 18, 3, 10]
- Node 6: Leaves = [9, 7, 3]
- Node 7: Leaves = [16, 14, 6, 12]
- Node 8: Leaves = [9, 3, 1]
- Node 9: Leaves = [5, 6, 8, 15]
- Node 10: Leaves = [5, 19, 4]
- Node 11: Leaves = [16, 13, 4, 17, 15]
- Node 12: Leaves = [7, 13]
- Node 13: Leaves = [11, 16, 2, 12]
- Node 14: Leaves = [17, 7]
- Node 15: Leaves = [11, 9]
- Node 16: Leaves = [11, 7, 1, 13, 4]
- Node 17: Leaves = [11, 14]
- Node 18: Leaves = [5, 2]
- Node 19: Leaves = [2, 10]

Now, let's enumerate the unique 3-stars:
<1, (16, 8, 0)>
<2, (18, 19, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (11, 16, 4)>
<5, (9, 18, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 6)>
<7, (16, 14, 7)>
<8, (9, 15, 11)>
<9, (5, 10, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
