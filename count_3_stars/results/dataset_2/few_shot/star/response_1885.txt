Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes (centers) are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, we will need to go through each center node and identify the 3-stars associated with each center node. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, _)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph and put the final answer inside brackets:
[9]
