Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list:
1. Node 1 forms 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 0. <1, (9, 3, 0)>
2. Node 2 forms 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 0. <2, (5, 4, 0)>
3. Node 3 forms 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 8. <3, (9, 6, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 6. <4, (9, 8, 6)>
5. Node 5 forms 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 7. <5, (6, 8, 7)>
6. Node 6 forms 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 7. <6, (5, 4, 7)>
7. Node 7 forms 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 2. <7, (5, 6, 2)>
8. Node 8 forms 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 3. <8, (5, 1, 3)>
9. Node 9 forms 3-star with nodes 4, 2, and 3. <9, (4, 2, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
