Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-star configurations:
- <0, (9, 6, 8)>
- <1, (9, 7, _)>
- <2, (5, 6, 3)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 0)>
- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <7, (1, 3, 0)>
- <8, (6, 3, 7)>
- <9, (5, 1, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9].
