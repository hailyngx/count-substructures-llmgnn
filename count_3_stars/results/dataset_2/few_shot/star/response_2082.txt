Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 7, 3), (9, 6, 7), (6, 1, 3), (5, 9, 3)
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes (8, 3, 0), (5, 6, 7), (5, 3, 0)
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes (5, 1, 7), (4, 0, 1)
- Node 4 forms 3-star with nodes (6, 0, 1)
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
