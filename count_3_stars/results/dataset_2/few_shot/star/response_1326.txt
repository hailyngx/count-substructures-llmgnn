Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: {7, 1, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 1, 0, 8}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 8, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 3}
- Node 6: {7, 1, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 3, 2}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 7}

Given the above information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- [5]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
