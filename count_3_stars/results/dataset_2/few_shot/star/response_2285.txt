Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes with 3 connections are: 2, 4, 11, and 13.

2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars involving each of these nodes:
   - Node 2 forms 3-stars with connections (5, 11, 13) and (2, 4, 12).
   - Node 4 forms 2-star with connections (3, 4, 14).
   - Node 11 forms 3-stars with connections (5, 1, 10) and (7, 8, 11).
   - Node 13 forms 1 3-star with connections (9, 12, 2).

3. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
   <2, (5, 11, 13)>, <2, (2, 4, 12)>, <4, (3, 4, 14)>, <11, (5, 1, 10)>, <11, (7, 8, 11)>, <13, (9, 12, 2)>.

4. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have 6 3-stars in the given graph.

5. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
