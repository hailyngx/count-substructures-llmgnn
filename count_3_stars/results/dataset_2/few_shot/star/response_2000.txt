Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (9, 16, 0)>
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
<2, (8, 5, 16)>
<3, (11, 8, 13)>
<4, (16, 17, 4)>
<5, (2, 12, 1)>
<6, (8, 14, 12)>
<7, (11, 1, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 3)>
<9, (2, 18, 0)>
<10, (15, 1, 13)>
<11, (7, 3, 1)>
<12, (5, 6, 19)>
<13, (10, 3, 19)>
<14, (5, 6, 14)>
<15, (10, 15, None)>
<16, (2, 0, 4)>
<17, (4, 18, 19)>
<18, (9, 17, 18)>
<19, (3, 13, 12)>
