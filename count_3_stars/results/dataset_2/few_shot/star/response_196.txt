Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to each node. We need to find nodes that form 3-stars, which means a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (0, 14, 13)>
<9, (6, 3, 10)>
<8, (4, 1, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
