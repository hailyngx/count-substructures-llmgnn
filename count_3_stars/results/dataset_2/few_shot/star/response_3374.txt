Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. A node must have exactly three neighbors to form a 3-star.
   Nodes with exactly three neighbors in this graph are: 
   - Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 0}
   - Node 8: neighbors {5, 4, 7}

2. Now, for each center node found, let's list the 3-stars with that node as the center:
   <6, (1, 4, 0)>
   <8, (5, 4, 7)>

So, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
