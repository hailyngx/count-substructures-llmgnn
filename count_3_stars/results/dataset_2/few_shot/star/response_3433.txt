Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9)

Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Looking at the definition, we can see that each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on this definition.

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 0, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 2, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 2}
- Node 7: {3, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 9, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Since we need to list the unique 3-stars only once, the total number of unique 3-stars is [6]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
