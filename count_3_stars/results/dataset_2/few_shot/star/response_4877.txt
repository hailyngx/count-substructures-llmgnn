Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of times each node is the center of a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars with center at node 0: 0
Count of 3-stars with center at node 1: 3
Count of 3-stars with center at node 2: 0
Count of 3-stars with center at node 3: 6
Count of 3-stars with center at node 4: 3
Count of 3-stars with center at node 5: 6
Count of 3-stars with center at node 6: 6
Count of 3-stars with center at node 7: 0
Count of 3-stars with center at node 8: 0
Count of 3-stars with center at node 9: 3
Count of 3-stars with center at node 10: 3
Count of 3-stars with center at node 11: 0
Count of 3-stars with center at node 12: 3
Count of 3-stars with center at node 13: 6
Count of 3-stars with center at node 14: 3
