Response:
Step by step process to count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
    - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 18, Node 19

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
   
    For Node 0: No 3-star formed (only 2 edges present)
   
    For Node 1: No 3-star formed (only 3 edges present)
    
    For Node 2: No 3-star formed (one neighbor has 4 connections)
   
    For Node 3: Formed 3-star: <3, (6, 1, 18)>
    
    For Node 4: No 3-star formed (one neighbor has 4 connections)
    
    For Node 5: Formed 3-star: <5, (6, 11, 19)>
    
    For Node 9: Formed 3-star: <9, (6, 18, 10)>, <9, (6, 17, 19)>
    
    For Node 10: Formed 3-star: <10, (9, 11, 0)>
    
    For Node 11: No 3-star formed (one neighbor has 4 connections)
    
    For Node 12: No 3-star formed (only 3 edges present)
    
    For Node 13: No 3-star formed (only 2 edges present)
    
    For Node 14: No 3-star formed (only 2 edges present)
    
    For Node 18: No 3-star formed (one neighbor has 4 connections)
    
    For Node 19: No 3-star formed (only 2 edges present)

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (6, 1, 18)>, <5, (6, 11, 19)>, <9, (6, 18, 10)>, <9, (6, 17, 19)>, <10, (9, 11, 0)>
