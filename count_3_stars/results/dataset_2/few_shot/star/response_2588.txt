Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-star graphs based on the definition provided.

Starting with the central node, we will identify all 3-stars and then count them.

Here are the unique 3-star graphs in the given graph:
<0, (14, 11, 13)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 12, 13)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 12)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 11)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (10, 12, 14)>
<10, (9, 12, 14)>
<11, (6, 7, 13)>
<12, (2, 4, 10)>
<13, (2, 11, 6)>
<14, (0, 6, 10)>

There are [14] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
