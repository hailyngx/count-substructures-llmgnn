Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars based on the connections each central node has.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (9, 1, 3)>
2. <1, (4, 0, 8)>
3. <2, (6, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (6, 0, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (7, 8)>
7. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
8. <7, (6, 1, 4)>
9. <8, (6, 9, 1)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
