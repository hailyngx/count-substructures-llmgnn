Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars containing each node as the center and summing them up.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each possible center node:

1. Node 0: 2 3-stars
   - <0, (16, 9)>
2. Node 1: 1 3-star
   - <1, (10, 14, 20)>
3. Node 2: 4 3-stars
   - <2, (7, 8, 23)>
   - <2, (7, 13, 26)>
   - <2, (13, 2, 26)>
   - <2, (8, 14, 20)>
4. Node 3: 0 3-stars
5. Node 4: 2 3-stars
   - <4, (16, 15, 28)>
   - <4, (16, 15, 18)>
6. Node 5: 3 3-stars
   - <5, (28, 18, 15)>
   - <5, (28, 16, 4)>
   - <5, (28, 16, 0)>
7. Node 6: 1 3-star
   - <6, (25, 22, 11)>
8. Node 7: 3 3-stars
   - <7, (21, 7, 25)>
   - <7, (21, 7, 2)>
   - <7, (25, 19, 6)>
9. Node 8: 1 3-star
   - <8, (23, 2, 14)>
10. Node 9: 2 3-stars
   - <9, (16, 0, 20)>
   - <9, (16, 9, 20)>
11. Node 10: 1 3-star
   - <10, (17, 28, 19)>
12. Node 11: 1 3-star
   - <11, (29, 13, 6)>
13. Node 12: 0 3-stars
14. Node 13: 1 3-star
   - <13, (2, 13, 26)>
15. Node 14: 0 3-stars
16. Node 15: 2 3-stars
   - <15, (21, 15, 4)>
   - <15, (21, 15, 18)>
17. Node 16: 2 3-stars
   - <16, (28, 16, 4)>
   - <16, (28, 16, 0)>
18. Node 17: 1 3-star
   - <17, (10, 17, 19)>
19. Node 18: 2 3-stars
   - <18, (10, 18, 5)>
   - <18, (15, 18, 5)>
20. Node 19: 2 3-stars
   - <19, (10, 17, 19)>
   - <19, (18, 19, 25)>
21. Node 20: 2 3-stars
   - <20, (14, 20, 22)>
   - <20, (26, 20, 9)>
22. Node 21: 2 3-stars
   - <21, (7, 21, 15)>
   - <21, (15, 21, 4)>
23. Node 22: 1 3-star
   - <22, (27, 22, 20)>
24. Node 23: 0 3-stars
25. Node 24: 1 3-star
   - <24, (29, 24, 26)>
26. Node 25: 1 3-star
   - <25, (7, 25, 19)>
27. Node 26: 2 3-stars
   - <26, (13, 26, 24)>
   - <26, (24, 26, 20)>
28. Node 27: 0 3-stars
29. Node 28: 2 3-stars
   - <28, (17, 28, 5)>
   - <28, (16, 28, 4)>
30. Node 29: 1 3-star
   - <29, (24, 29, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
