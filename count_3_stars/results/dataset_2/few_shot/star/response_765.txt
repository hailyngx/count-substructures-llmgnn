Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 12, and 16.
2. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 10, and 12.
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 6, and 1.
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 17, and 2.
5. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 23, and 26.
6. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 29, and 26.

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6].

Therefore, the answer is [6].

<7, (21, 12, 16)>
<28, (13, 10, 12)>
<5, (21, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 17, 2)>
<14, (29, 23, 26)>
<25, (13, 29, 26)>
