Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 2 with neighbors 11, 18, and 1 forms a 3-star: <2, (11, 18, 1)>
- Node 3 with neighbors 15, 4, and 9 forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 4, 9)>
- Node 10 with neighbors 15, 2, and 19 forms a 3-star: <10, (15, 2, 19)>
- Node 15 with neighbors 16, 3, and 1 forms a 3-star: <15, (16, 3, 1)>
- Node 17 with neighbors 8, 2, and 18 forms a 3-star: <17, (8, 2, 18)>
- Node 18 with neighbors 2, 7, and 17 forms a 3-star: <18, (2, 7, 17)>
- Node 19 with neighbors 10, 0, and 12 forms a 3-star: <19, (10, 0, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: 7
