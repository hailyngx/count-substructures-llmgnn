Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This means we are looking for a central node with exactly three neighbors. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 17)>
<9, (5, 6, 18)>
<6, (9, 10, 8)>
<14, (5, 0, 0)>
<17, (5, 1, 3)>
<10, (6, 11, 13)>
<8, (6, 13, 4)>
<12, (11, 7, 7)>
<1, (17, 7, 16)>
<3, (9, 17, 18)>
<18, (9, 8, 3)>
<16, (4, 1, 19)>
<19, (8, 2, 16)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
