Response:
Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that fit this criteria in the given graph. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Find nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Nodes 1, 10, and 7 have exactly three neighbors, so they can be potential center nodes.

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - For node 1: (1, 4) is the only edge, so it cannot form a 3-star.
   - For node 10: (10, 4), (10, 13), (10, 14) - This forms a 3-star: <10, (4, 13, 14)>.
   - For node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6) - This also forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars found: 
   - Two unique 3-stars were found: <10, (4, 13, 14)> and <7, (0, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
