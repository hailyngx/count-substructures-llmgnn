Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph: 
- From node 0: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 9, 7)>
- From node 3: <3, (5, 6, 4)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 0, 3)>
- From node 5: <5, (2, 8, 1)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 7, 3)>
- From node 7: <7, (9, 2, 3)>
- From node 8: <8, (5, 6, 0)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 2, 1)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph mentioned. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
