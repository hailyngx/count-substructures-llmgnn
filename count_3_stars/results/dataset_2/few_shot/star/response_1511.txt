Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To find all 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes and visualize them in the form of a 3-star where this node is the central node and the other 3 nodes are the leaves. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 6, 2
- Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: 6, 0, 3

2. Construct 3-stars using these nodes:
- <1, (8, 6, 2)>
- <7, (6, 0, 3)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]
