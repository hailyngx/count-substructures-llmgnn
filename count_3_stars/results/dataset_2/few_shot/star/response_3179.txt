Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. First, identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes have exactly three connections:
   - Node 5 connected to nodes 6, 29, and 11.
   - Node 6 connected to nodes 5, 28, and 29.
   - Node 29 connected to nodes 5, 14, and 6.
   
2. Next, count the 3-stars for each of these identified nodes:
   - For Node 5: (5, 6, 29), (5, 11, 29) [2 unique 3-stars]
   - For Node 6: (6, 5, 29), (6, 28, 29) [2 unique 3-stars]
   - For Node 29: (29, 5, 6), (29, 5, 14) [2 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 29, 11)>, <6, (5, 29, 28)>, <29, (6, 5, 14)>.
