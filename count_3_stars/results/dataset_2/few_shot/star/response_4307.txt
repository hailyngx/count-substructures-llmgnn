Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
    - Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 1, 3, and 12. (Only 3-star is <6, (9, 1, 3)>)
    - Node 11 is connected to 4 other nodes: 10, 5, 4, and 2. (Only 3-star is <11, (10, 5, 4)>)
    - Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes: 6, 17, 7, 14, and 5. 
    - Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 11, 8, 13, and 14.
    - Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes: 4, 2, 19, and 16.
    - Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 6, 18, and 7.
    - Node 10 is connected to 2 other nodes: 11 and 17.
    - Node 12 is connected to 1 other node: 6.
    - Node 1 is connected to 2 other nodes: 6 and 13.
    - Node 7 is connected to 2 other nodes: 9 and 3.
    - Node 13 is connected to 2 other nodes: 4 and 1.
    - Node 14 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 15, and 3.
    - Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes: 11 and 0.
    - Node 15 is connected to 2 other nodes: 14 and 16.
    - Node 18 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 17, 19, and 16.
    - Node 19 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 7, and 18.
  
2. Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars found:
    - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
    - <11, (10, 5, 4)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [2]
