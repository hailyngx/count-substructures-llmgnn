Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., create a 3-star pattern). Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<3, (15, 11, 0)>
<3, (15, 11, 19)>
<3, (15, 11, 12)>
<15, (3, 10, 16)>
<11, (3, 17, 5)>
<11, (3, 17, 7)>
<4, (17, 12, 9)>
<12, (4, 18, 13)>
<12, (4, 18, 16)>
<18, (2, 1, 13)>
<18, (2, 1, 0)>
<19, (3, 14, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
