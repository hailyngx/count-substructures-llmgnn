Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <8, (9, 10, 11)>
- <11, (10, 3, 4)>
- <12, (9, 1, 6)>
- <13, (9, 3, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <8, (9, 10, 11)> <11, (10, 3, 4)> <12, (9, 1, 6)> <13, (9, 3, 14)>.
