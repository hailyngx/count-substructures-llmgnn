Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes) are nodes 0, 1, 4, 12, and 15.

2. We will now check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars with their neighbors.

    - Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 19. <0, (3, 6, 19)>
    - Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 17, and 7. <1, (10, 17, 7)>
    - Node 4: Does not form a 3-star as it only has one neighbor.
    - Node 12: Does not form a 3-star as it only has one neighbor.
    - Node 15: Does not form a 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

3. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 19)>, <1, (10, 17, 7)>.
