Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. For node 0:
    - <0, (7, 8, 5)>
    
2. For node 1:
    - <1, (6, 3, 2)>
    - <1, (6, 4, 8)>
    
3. For node 2:
    - <2, (9, 1, 7)>
    
4. For node 3:
    - No 3-star as node 3 doesn't have 3 connections.
    
5. For node 4:
    - No 3-star as node 4 doesn't have 3 connections.
    
6. For node 5:
    - <5, (6, 3, 2)>
    
7. For node 6:
    - <6, (9, 5, 1)>
    
8. For node 7:
    - <7, (6, 9, 3)>
    - <7, (6, 9, 4)>
    - <7, (6, 0, 2)>
    
9. For node 8:
    - No 3-star as node 8 doesn't have 3 connections.
    
10. For node 9:
    - <9, (6, 8, 2)>
    
Count of 3-stars: [9]
