Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 14. <8, (13, 4, 14)>
2. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 5, and 3. <13, (8, 5, 3)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 6. <4, (8, 9, 6)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 14, and 2. <3, (13, 14, 2)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 1. <9, (13, 4, 1)>
6. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 5, and 9. <10, (12, 5, 9)>
7. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 0. <12, (5, 6, 0)>
8. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 3, and 12. <14, (8, 3, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
