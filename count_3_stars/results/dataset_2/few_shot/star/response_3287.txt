Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the node 5 has connections to nodes 9, 6, 8, 1, and 3. This forms the following 3-stars: 
   <5, (9, 6, 8)>
   <5, (9, 1, 3)>

2. Similarly, node 9 has connections to nodes 5, 6, 3, and 7. This forms the following 3-stars:
   <9, (5, 6, 3)>
   <9, (5, 7, 6)>
   
3. Node 6 has connections to nodes 5, 9, 2, and 4. This forms the following 3-stars:
   <6, (5, 9, 2)>
   
4. Node 1 has connections to nodes 5, 3, 4, 0, and 7. This also forms a 3-star:
   <1, (5, 3, 4)> 

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars.
