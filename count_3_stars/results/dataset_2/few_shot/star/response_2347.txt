Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges and adjacency lists. 

Next, we will list out all unique 3-stars found in the graph and then provide the final count within brackets.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <5, (0, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
8. <7, (2, 4, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
