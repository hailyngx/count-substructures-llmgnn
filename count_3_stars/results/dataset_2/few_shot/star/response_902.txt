Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that create 3-stars as described in the problem. 

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can see which nodes have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can act as the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 8
- Node 12
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 18
- Node 26

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For Node 1: <1, (3, 15, 10)>
2. For Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 12)>
3. For Node 3: <3, (1, 25, 27)>
4. For Node 8: <8, (25, 28, 20)>
5. For Node 12: <12, (26, 2, 24)>
6. For Node 15: <15, (1, 26, 2)>
7. For Node 16: <16, (6, 8, 24)>
8. For Node 18: <18, (24, 27, 13)>
9. For Node 26: <26, (5, 15, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
