Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph using the adjacency list provided:
   
   - From the adjacency list, we see the following 3-star patterns:
     - <5, (9, 2, 4)> including the edges (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4)
     - <9, (5, 6, 1)> including the edges (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 1)
     - <6, (9, 1, 7)> including the edges (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7)
     - <4, (5, 7, 8)> including the edges (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8)
     - <0, (4, 2, 3)> including the edges (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 3)
     - <2, (5, 9, 4)> including the edges (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4)
     - <1, (9, 6, 4)> including the edges (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4)
     
2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 2, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>
   
3. Output the final answer inside brackets:
   - [7]
