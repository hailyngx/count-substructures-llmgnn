Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: This node has 3 neighbors (4, 19, 23). <1, (4, 19, 23)>
- Node 2: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4: This node has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7: This node has 3 neighbors (10, 19, 15). <7, (10, 19, 15)>
- Node 8: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 20, 23). <9, (2, 20, 23)>
- Node 10: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 11: This node has 3 neighbors (27, 22, 25). <11, (27, 22, 25)>
- Node 12: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 13: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 14: This node has 3 neighbors (27, 22, 6). <14, (27, 22, 6)>
- Node 15: This node has 3 neighbors (12, 7, 2). <15, (12, 7, 2)>
- Node 16: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 17: This node has 5 neighbors (10, 29, 3, 16, 21). <17, (10, 29, 3)>
- Node 18: This node has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 19: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 20: This node has 3 neighbors (9, 27, 29). <20, (9, 27, 29)>
- Node 21: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 22: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 23: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 24: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 25: This node has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 26: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 27: This node has 3 neighbors (14, 11, 20). <27, (14, 11, 20)>
- Node 28: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 29: This node has 3 neighbors (17, 20, 6). <29, (17, 20, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 19, 23)>
<7, (10, 19, 15)>
<9, (2, 20, 23)>
<11, (27, 22, 25)>
<14, (27, 22, 6)>
<20, (9, 27, 29)>
