Response:
The first step is to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph. 
Given the nature of a 3-star graph, we can find them by looking at each node individually and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. We need to check for each node if it is connected to exactly three other nodes and there are edges between those three nodes. 

After examining all nodes, we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 14)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 11, 12)>
<5, (3, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<10, (2, 12, 13)>
<11, (4, 5, 13)>
<12, (4, 10, 13)>
<13, (7, 10, 11)>
<14, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have found 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Thus, the answer is [15].
