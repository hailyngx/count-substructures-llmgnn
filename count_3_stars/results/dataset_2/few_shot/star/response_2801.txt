Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the possible 3-stars include:
- <0, (5, 7, 2)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <2, (9, 8, 0)>
- <3, (4, 0, 6)>
- <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 4, 0)>
- <8, (4, 1, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 2)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
