Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (3, 20, 13)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (15, 1, 13)>
3. Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (8, 9, 28)> and <4, (9, 25, 29)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (14, 2, 12)>
5. Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (23, 26, 19)> and <6, (26, 7, 18)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star <7, (23, 27, 26)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (4, 24, 10)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (15, 4, 29)>
9. Node 11 forms a 3-star <11, (16, 27, 12)>
10. Node 14 forms a 3-star <14, (15, 29, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
