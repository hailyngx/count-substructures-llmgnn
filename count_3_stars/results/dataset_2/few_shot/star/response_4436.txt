Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 9, 4, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 9, 5, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 9, 4, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 8, 3, 1)
- Node 5: (5, 8, 2, 0)

2. Count the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <9, (2, 3, 1)>
- <1, (9, 4, 8)>
- <2, (9, 5, 3)>
- <4, (8, 3, 1)>
- <5, (8, 2, 0)>

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
