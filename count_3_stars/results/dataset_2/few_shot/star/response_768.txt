Node 19 is connected to node 5, 15, and node 7

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[0, (11, 1, 9)]>
<[1, (0, 7, 9)]>
<[2, (5, 3, 10)]>
<[3, (5, 7, 11)]>
<[5, (2, 3, 19)]>
<[9, (1, 7, 11)]>
<[11, (9, 3, 18)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
