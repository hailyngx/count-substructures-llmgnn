Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. The key observation here is that for a 3-star, one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves).

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 13, 14: <4, (7, 13, 14)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, 14: <1, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, 13: <5, (3, 6, 13)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, 12: <2, (9, 10, 12)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, 12: <0, (10, 11, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
