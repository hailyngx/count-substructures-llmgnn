Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the unique 3-star structures in the graph. A 3-star in this case will have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list and edge information, we can list down all the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 6, 1)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (8, 3, 5)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars which is [9].
