Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<9, (26, 18, 25)>
<26, (9, 13, 15)>
<18, (9, 22, 14)>
<22, (18, 28, 29)>
<10, (11, 21, 7)>
<11, (10, 5, 29)>
<8, (4, 19, 6)>
<13, (26, 7, _)> (Not complete, missing 1 leaf node for node 13)
<4, (8, 6, _)>
<0, (20, 2, _)> (Not complete, missing 1 leaf node for node 0)
<20, (26, 0, _)>
<1, (17, 15, 19)>
<17, (1, 28, _)>
<24, (7, 14, _)>
<15, (26, 1, 28)>
<19, (10, 8, 2)>
<25, (9, 14, _)> (Not complete, missing 1 leaf node for node 25)
<16, (15, 12, 5)>
<21, (22, 10, 23)>
<12, (16, 23, _)>
<2, (0, 17, 19)>
<28, (22, 17, 15)>
<6, (4, 29, 23)>
<29, (22, 11, 6)>
<_ signifies a missing node>

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars. 
Since the 3-stars are symmetric around the center node, there are 15 unique configurations. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
