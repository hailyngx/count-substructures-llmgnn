Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 19)>
<1, (3, 11, 16)>
<2, (6, 11, 19)>
<3, (0, 1, 17)>
<4, (2, 15, 16)>
<5, (7, 9, 15)>
<6, (2)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 11)>
<9, (5, 7, 12)>
<10, (1, 18)>
<11, (1, 2, 18)>
<12, (9, 14)>
<13, (3, 7, 16)>
<14, (12, 18)>
<15, (4, 5, 18)>
<16, (1, 13, 4)>
<17, (3, 13)>
<18, (10, 11, 15)>
<19, (0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
