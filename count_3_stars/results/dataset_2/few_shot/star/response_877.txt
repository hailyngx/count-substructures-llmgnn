Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can identify the number of 3-star subgraphs centered at each node:

1. Node 0: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to 5 nodes.
3. Node 2: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to 5 nodes.
4. Node 3: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to 6 nodes.
5. Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
8. Node 7: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-star subgraphs as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <4, (5, 9, 1)> and <9, (5, 4, 1)>.
