Response:
Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (11, 16, 18)>
2. <1, (17, 19, 7)>
3. <2, (3)>
4. <3, (2, 19, 13)>
5. <4, (9)>
6. <5, (9, 6, 18)>
7. <6, (5, 17, 14)>
8. <7, (16, 9, 1)>
9. <9, (5, 4, 7)>
10. <10, (11, 15, 13)>
11. <11, (16, 10, 0)>
12. <12, (9, 17, 14)>
13. <13, (10, 12, 3)>
14. <14, (6, 18, 12)>
15. <15, (16, 5, 10)>
16. <16, (11, 0, 7)>
17. <17, (6, 1, 12)>
18. <18, (5, 0, 14)>
19. <19, (1, 3)>

By observing the graph closely and the given adjacency list for each node, we have found all the unique 3-stars. Now, let's count the number of such 3-stars and put the final answer inside brackets: [19].
