Response:
The center node of each 3-star can be any node with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 15, 16)>
<3, (1, 9, 18)>
<7, (12, 16, 11)>
<12, (7, 6, 19)>
<13, (8, 4, 0)>
<16, (1, 7, 19)>
<19, (12, 5, 11)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
