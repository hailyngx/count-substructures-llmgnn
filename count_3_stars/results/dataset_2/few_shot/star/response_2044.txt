Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:

- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <10, (0, 6, 12)>
- <12, (4, 10, 13)>
- <15, (8, 19, ___)> (Since the empty space represents a node not connected to any other nodes, there is no third connected node to form a 3-star with node 15)
- <16, (0, 17, 19)>
- <18, (0, 19, ___)> (Similar to node 15, there is no third connected node to complete the 3-star with node 18)

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
