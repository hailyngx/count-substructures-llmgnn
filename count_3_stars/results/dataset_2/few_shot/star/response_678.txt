Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 11, 12, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 11, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 12, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 13, 10, 12, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 10, 11, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 13, 0, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 13, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 14, and node 12

Response:
To count the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each combination of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. <5, (9, 1, 3)>
3. <5, (9, 3, 5)>
4. <9, (5, 6, 14)>
5. <9, (6, 14, 12)>
6. <6, (9, 7, 10)>
7. <6, (7, 10, 13)>
8. <8, (5, 1, 13)>
9. <13, (8, 3, 10)>
10. <2, (12, 1, 12)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
