Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations of 3-stars.

Let's represent the nodes in the given graph as follows for easier reference:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 19

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (9, 14, 12)>
2. <1, (11, 18, 13)>
3. <2, (5, 17, 3)>
4. <3, (5, 19, 6)>
5. <4, (12, 13, 5)>
6. <5, (9, 13, 2)>
7. <6, (14, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (11, 14, 18)>
9. <8, (19, 12, 9)>
10. <9, (5, 16, 0)>
11. <10, (11, 16, 3)>
12. <11, (7, 10, 1)>
13. <12, (4, 18, 8)>
14. <13, (5, 14, 1)>
15. <14, (7, 0, 6)>
16. <15, (19)>
17. <16, (9, 10, 3)>
18. <17, (11, 2)>
19. <18, (5, 7, 12)>
20. <19, (8, 15, 3)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
