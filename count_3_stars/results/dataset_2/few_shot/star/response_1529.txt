Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the given adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with the following connections can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: (6, 9, 13)
- Node 4: (6, 9, 12), (6, 4, 14)
- Node 5: (13, 10, 14)
- Node 6: (9, 7, 11)
- Node 9: (4, 11, 1)
- Node 10: (3, 4, 14)

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 9, 13)>, 
<4, (6, 9, 12)>, 
<4, (6, 4, 14)>, 
<5, (13, 10, 14)>, 
<6, (9, 7, 11)>, 
<9, (4, 11, 1)>, 
<10, (3, 4, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
