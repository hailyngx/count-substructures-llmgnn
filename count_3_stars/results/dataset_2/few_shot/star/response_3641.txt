Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 3, 11, 1, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 12, 13, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 12, 8, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 3, 6, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 12, 14, 4, 11, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, 1, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 8, 9, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 14, 2, 4, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 11, 9, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 8, and 10
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 12, 13, and 10
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 13, and 10
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 7, 12, 8, and 11

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 8, 10)>
<2, (12, 13, 10)>
<4, (9, 13, 10)>
<6, (7, 12, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
