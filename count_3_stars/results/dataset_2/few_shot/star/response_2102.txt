Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (12, 18, 17)>
<1, (6, 18, 16)>
<2, (3, 15, 18)>
<3, (2, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (15, 19, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 13)>
<7, (11, 15, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 10)>
<9, (13, 15, 9)>
<10, (8, 10, 19)>
<11, (7, 12, 11)>
<12, (0, 16, 19)>
<13, (6, 15, 11)>
<14, (16, 18, 14)>
<15, (2, 13, 15)>
<16, (12, 14, 18)>
<17, (0, 19, 17)>
<18, (1, 2, 16)>
<19, (5, 10, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
