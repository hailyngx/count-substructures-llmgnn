Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (7, 2, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
