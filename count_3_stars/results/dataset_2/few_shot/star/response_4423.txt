Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (7, 13, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 6)>
<3, (2, 11, 14)>
<10, (8, 3, 12)>
<11, (4, 5, 3)>
<12, (2, 13, 10)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>
<14, (7, 13, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
