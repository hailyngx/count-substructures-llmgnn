Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 10)
   - Node 10 (connected to nodes 5, 12, 1)
   
2. For each node identified in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - For Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 10)> (1 is the central node and 0, 5, 10 are its neighbors)
   - For Node 10: <10, (5, 12, 1)> (10 is the central node and 5, 12, 1 are its neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 5, 10)> and <10, (5, 12, 1)>.
