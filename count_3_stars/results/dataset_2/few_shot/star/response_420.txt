Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

1. Node 4 has the neighbors: 5, 6, 10
   <4, (5, 6, 10)>
   
2. Node 10 has the neighbors: 4, 17, 18
   <10, (4, 17, 18)>
   
3. Node 5 has the neighbors: 4, 17, 16
    <5, (4, 16, 17)>
 
4. Node 18 has the neighbors: 10, 7, 8
    <18, (8, 7, 10)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [4].
