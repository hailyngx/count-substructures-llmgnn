Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Let's go through all nodes and identify the 3-stars:
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<9, (6, 14, 3)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<10, (6, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 12)>
<11, (7, 5, 2)>
<12, (8, 2, 13)>
<13, (3, 4, 7)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
