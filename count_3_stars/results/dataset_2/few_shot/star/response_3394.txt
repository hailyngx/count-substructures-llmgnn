Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes forming a star pattern around it.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<5, (6, 5, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 2)>
<9, (9, 6, 3)>
