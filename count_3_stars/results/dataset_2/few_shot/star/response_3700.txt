Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- There are 4 3-stars with center node 0: <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <0, (9, 1, 6)>, <0, (9, 6, 2)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- There are 5 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (9, 7, 0)>, <1, (9, 7, 2)>, <1, (7, 0, 9)>, <1, (7, 2, 0)>, <1, (0, 9, 7)>
- There are 3 3-stars with center node 2: <2, (9, 7, 3)>, <2, (9, 3, 6)>, <2, (7, 3, 6)>
- There are 5 3-stars with center node 3: <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 4)>
- There are 4 3-stars with center node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (7, 3, 8)>
- There are 4 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- There are 5 3-stars with center node 6: <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 9)>
- There are 5 3-stars with center node 7: <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>
- There are 4 3-stars with center node 8: <8, (5, 4, 3)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- There are 4 3-stars with center node 9: <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].
