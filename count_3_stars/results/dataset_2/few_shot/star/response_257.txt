Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
