Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars that exist in the graph.

Let's start by listing the candidate 3-stars using the adjacency list provided for each node:
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 0: <0, (7, 15, 17)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 1: <1, (6, 9, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 11)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 2: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 3: <3, (6, 9, 18)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 4: <4, (8, 18, 17)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 5: <5, (8, 12, 10)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 6: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 7: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 8: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 9: <9, (10, 1, 12)>
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 10: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 11: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 12: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 13: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 14: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 15: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 16: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 17: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 18: None
- Potential 3-stars with center at node 19: None

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (7, 15, 17)>, <1, (6, 9, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 11)>, <3, (6, 9, 18)>, <4, (8, 18, 17)>, and <5, (8, 12, 10)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
