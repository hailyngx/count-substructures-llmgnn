Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
