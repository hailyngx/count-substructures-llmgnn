Response:
Let's first find the 3-stars in the given graph:
From the adjacency list, we can see the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, and 7.
Now, let's list the 3-stars we can form with these nodes:
<0, (16, 2, 3)>
<2, (7, 0, 3)>
<5, (8, 5, 11)>
<7, (2, 1, 6)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
