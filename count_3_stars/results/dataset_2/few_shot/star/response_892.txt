Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 14, 19, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 16, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 5, 12, 7, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 13, 4, 18, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 3
- Node 10: degree = 5
- Node 11: degree = 5
- Node 12: degree = 2
- Node 13: degree = 4
- Node 14: degree = 3
- Node 15: degree = 2
- Node 16: degree = 3
- Node 17: degree = 3
- Node 18: degree = 4
- Node 19: degree = 1

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a "star" around that node.

<0, (14, 15)>
<1, (15, 16, 7)>
<3, (9, 18, 16)>
<4, (17, 18, 11)>
<5, (14, 19, 10)>
<9, (16, 3, 7)>
<12, (2, 10, 0)>
<14, (17, 0, 5)>
<15, (0, 1, 5)>
<16, (9, 1, 3)>
<17, (14, 18, 4)>
<18, (17, 4, 11)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
- There are 12 unique 3-stars identified.
