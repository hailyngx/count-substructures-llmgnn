Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

For each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which will form a 3-star pattern around it. We will list them as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<20, (3, 23, 28)>
<25, (8, 0, 15)>
<10, (21, 9, 12)>
<11, (23, 7, 1)>
<17, (29, 16, 22)>
<2, (18, 13, 17)>
<18, (26, 16, 2)>
<27, (12, 1, 5)>
<26, (18, 6, 5)>
<3, (27, 21, 14)>
<21, (10, 12, 3)>
<23, (11, 4, 20)>
<15, (19, 0, 22)>
<8, (25, 6, 0)>
<9, (10, 0, -)>
<14, (12, 19, 7)>
<6, (26, 8, -)>
<24, (28, 19, 0)>
<1, (29, 7, 11)>
<29, (4, 1, 17)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
Unique 3-stars: <20, (3, 23, 28)> <25, (8, 0, 15)> <10, (21, 9, 12)> <11, (23, 7, 1)> <17, (29, 16, 22)> <2, (18, 13, 17)> <18, (26, 16, 2)> <27, (12, 1, 5)> <26, (18, 6, 5)> <3, (27, 21, 14)> <21, (10, 12, 3)> <23, (11, 4, 20)> <15, (19, 0, 22)> <8, (25, 6, 0)> <9, (10, 0, -)> <14, (12, 19, 7)> <6, (26, 8, -)> <24, (28, 19, 0)> <1, (29, 7, 11)> <29, (4, 1, 17)>
