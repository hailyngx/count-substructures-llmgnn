Response:
First, we can identify all the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 3: (3, 15, 6), (3, 9, 2), (3, 4, 17)
2. Node 15: (15, 3, 10), (15, 18, 19), (15, 11, 0)
3. Node 5: (5, 9, 4)
4. Node 9: (9, 3, 5), (9, 16, 0)
5. Node 6: (6, 3, 17), (6, 0, 16)
6. Node 7: (7, 13, 12)
7. Node 8: (8, 13, 2), (8, 14, 12)
8. Node 13: (13, 8, 17), (13, 1, 7)
9. Node 10: (10, 15, 12)
10. Node 17: (17, 6, 13), (17, 2, 4)
11. Node 12: (12, 7, 10), (12, 14, 19)
12. Node 18: (18, 15, 19)
13. Node 11: (11, 15, 0), (11, 19, 15)

Thus, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (15, 6, 9)>
<3, (15, 18, 11)>
<3, (4, 9, 17)>
<15, (3, 10, 18)>
<15, (11, 0, 19)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 3, 16)>
<6, (3, 17, 0)>
<7, (13, 12, 10)>
<8, (13, 2, 14)>
<13, (8, 17, 7)>
<17, (13, 4, 6)>
<10, (15, 7, 12)>
<12, (7, 10, 14)>
<18, (15, 19, 18)>
<11, (15, 0, 19)>
