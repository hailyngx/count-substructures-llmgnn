Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible combination of 3 nodes connected to the same central node. Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify nodes where this pattern occurs.

Counting the number of 3-stars:
1. For each node, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. If so, that node is the center of a 3-star.
2. Once we identify the center node, check if the neighbors of the center node are connected to each other. If they are, we have found a 3-star.
3. Repeat this process for all nodes in the graph.

Based on the given graph, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
