Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph based on the given information, we need to identify the unique 3-star structures in the graph. 

Based on the definition provided at the beginning: "A 3-star graph consists of a central node, called the center, which is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.", we can see that a 3-star has one central node and three leaves.

Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can enumerate the 3-stars in this graph and then count them:

1. <0, (7, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 3)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 7)>
4. <3, (5, 1, 0)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 1)>
6. <5, (4, 3, 2)>
7. <6, (9, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 1)>
9. <8, (7, 6, 3)>
10. <9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
