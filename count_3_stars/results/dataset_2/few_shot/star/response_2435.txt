Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
   - Node 11: <11, (3, 19, 4)>
   - Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 10)>
   - Node 4: <4, (11, 9, 2)>
   - Node 7: <7, (16, 15, 18)>
   - Node 12: <12, (5, 17, 6)>, <12, (5, 17, 18)>, <12, (5, 6, 18)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Unique 3-stars: <11, (3, 19, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 10)>, <4, (11, 9, 2)>, <7, (16, 15, 18)>, and <12, (5, 17, 6)>
   
3. Calculate the final answer:
   - Total number of 3-stars: [5]
   
Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets, is [5].
