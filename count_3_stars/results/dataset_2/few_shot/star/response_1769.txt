Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
