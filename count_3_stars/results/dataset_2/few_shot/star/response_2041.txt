Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the given graph's adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them: 

<0, (8, 5, 18)>
<1, (8, 10, 13)>
<2, (5, 16, 7)>
<3, (10, 6, 11)>
<4, (8, 13, 11)>
<5, (2, 18, 0)>
<6, (3, 11, 18)>
<7, (2, 10, 19)>
<8, (4, 12, 1)>
<9, (16, 19, 7)>
<10, (3, 7, 1)>
<11, (4, 6, 17)>
<12, (15, 8, 19)>
<13, (4, 14, 1)>
<15, (17, 12, 16)>
<16, (15, 2, 18)>
<17, (15, 4, 11)>
<18, (5, 6, 16)>
<19, (9, 7, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
