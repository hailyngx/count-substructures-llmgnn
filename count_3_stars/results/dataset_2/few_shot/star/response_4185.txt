Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have at least three neighbors in the given graph. Then we can check if the neighbors form a 3-star around the central node.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that have at least three neighbors are:
- Node 2: Connected to 5 other nodes
- Node 4: Connected to 4 other nodes
- Node 9: Connected to 4 other nodes
- Node 10: Connected to 3 other nodes
- Node 11: Connected to 3 other nodes
- Node 12: Connected to 3 other nodes
- Node 13: Connected to 3 other nodes
- Node 17: Connected to 5 other nodes
- Node 18: Connected to 4 other nodes
- Node 19: Connected to 5 other nodes

Now, let's check if the neighbors of these nodes form 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 8, 4
- <2, (0, 8, 4)>

For Node 4:
- Neighbors: 9, 1, 2
- <4, (9, 1, 2)>

For Node 9:
- Neighbors: 16, 13, 12
- <9, (16, 13, 12)>

For Node 17:
- Neighbors: 10, 11, 13
- <17, (10, 11, 13)>
- <17, (10, 11, 13)>

For Node 18:
- Neighbors: 13, 2, 19
- <18, (13, 2, 19)>

For Node 19:
- Neighbors: 3, 18, 8
- <19, (3, 18, 8)>
- <19, (3, 18, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
