Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 14, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 13, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 10, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 11, 8, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 7, 10, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 10, 12, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 13, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 14, 4, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 11, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all possible 3-stars. 

After examining the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 13)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (10, 11, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 11)>
<5, (1, 9, 11)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 10, 14)>
<8, (1, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 12)>
<10, (2, 7, 13)>
<11, (2, 4, 5)>
<12, (4, 8, 9)>
<13, (0, 10, 1)>
<14, (0, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 14.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
