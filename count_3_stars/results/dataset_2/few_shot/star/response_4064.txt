Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges.

After examining the adjacency list, we find that nodes 3, 12, and 15 are the only nodes with exactly three edges each. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the leaves of each 3-star by checking which nodes are connected to each central node.

For node 3:
- (3, 17)
- (3, 6)

Hence, the 3-star with node 3 as the central node is <3, (17, 6)>.

For node 12:
- (12, 2)
 
Hence, the 3-star with node 12 as the central node is <12, (2)>.

For node 15:
- (15, 16)
- (15, 6)

Hence, the 3-star with node 15 as the central node is <15, (16, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (17, 6)>, <12, (2)>, and <15, (16, 6)>.
