Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's list all the possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 0, 9)>
5. <4, (7, 0, 2)>
6. <5, (7, 2, 0)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 0)>
8. <7, (4, 0, 1)>
9. <8, (3, 2, 0)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 2)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars and put the final answer in brackets:
[10]
