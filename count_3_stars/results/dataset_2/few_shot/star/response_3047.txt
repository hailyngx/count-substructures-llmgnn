Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 0, and 19.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 19.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 7.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 16.

2. List the 3-stars with each of these nodes as the center:
   - <3, (0, 15, 19)>
   - <8, (2, 17, 19)>
   - <5, (2, 7, 15)>
   - <14, (4, 9, 16)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
