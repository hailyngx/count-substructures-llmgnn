Response:
We need to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (7, 12, 16)>
<1, (9, 8, 13)>
<2, (8, 3, 17)>
<3, (2, 10, 4)>
<4, (13, 10, 3)>
<5, (6, 1, 15)>
<6, (5, 19, -)>
<7, (12, 0, 17)>
<8, (2, 1, -)>
<9, (1, 13, -)>
<10, (0, 3, 4)>
<11, (2, 15, 18)>
<12, (7, 13, 0)>
<13, (9, 12, 4)>
<14, (9, 15, 18)>
<15, (5, 16, 18)>
<16, (0, 15, -)>
<17, (7, 2, -)>
<18, (15, 11, 14)>
<19, (6, -, -)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique 3-stars, and the number of each occurrence:
<0, (7, 12, 16)>
<1, (9, 8, 13)>
<2, (8, 3, 17)>
<3, (2, 10, 4)>
<4, (13, 10, 3)>
<5, (6, 1, 15)>
<6, (5, 19, -)>
<7, (12, 0, 17)>
<8, (2, 1, -)>
<9, (1, 13, -)>
<10, (0, 3, 4)>
<11, (2, 15, 18)>
<12, (7, 13, 0)>
<13, (9, 12, 4)>
<14, (9, 15, 18)>
<15, (5, 16, 18)>
<16, (0, 15, -)>
<17, (7, 2, -)>
<18, (15, 11, 14)>
<19, (6, -, -)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
