Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<5, (7, 1, 2)>
<6, (9, 3, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 5)>
<9, (7, 6)>

Count of all 3-stars in the graph: [9]
