Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
Nodes 0, 4, and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors each.

Step 2: Check for 3-stars using these nodes as potential centers:
1. For node 0: (0, 1, 4, 8), (0, 4, 6, 9), (0, 1, 8, 5)  
2. For node 4: (4, 0, 2, 6), (4, 2, 7, 8), (4, 6, 7, 9)  
3. For node 9: (9, 0, 6, 8)  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[4]  

<0, 1, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 8, 5>, <4, 0, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7, 9>, <9, 0, 6, 8>
