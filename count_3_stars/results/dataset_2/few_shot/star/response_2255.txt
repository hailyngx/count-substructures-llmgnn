Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with all the nodes and their connections, we can identify the 3-stars based on the description given:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars identified are:

<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
