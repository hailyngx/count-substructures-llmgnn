Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (10, 2, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 12)>
<2, (10, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 11, 0)>
<4, (6, 9, 11)>
<5, (8, 1, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 11, 10)>
<8, (11, 2, 5)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<10, (7, 11, 0)>
<11, (4, 7, 8)>
<12, (11, 1)>
<13, (7, 10, 0)>
<14, (9, 10, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
