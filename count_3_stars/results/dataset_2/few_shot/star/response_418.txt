Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Explanation:
- Since we have 10 nodes in the graph, we can go through each node to check for 3-stars.
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- For each node, we check if there are exactly three edges connected to it.
- If a node has exactly three edges and those edges do not form a loop, then we have a 3-star with that node as the center.

Number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<8, (6, 4, 3)>
