Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see which nodes have exactly 3 neighbors, these will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
   
   - Central nodes: Nodes 5, 9, 11, and 14
   
2. Next, we find the leaves connected to each central node:

   - For central node 5: Leaves are nodes 6, 13, and 8
   - For central node 9: Leaves are nodes 4 and 14
   - For central node 11: Leaves are nodes 8, 14, and 1
   - For central node 14: Leaves are nodes 9, 11, and 13
   
Now we list the unique 3-stars we found:

<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<9, (4, 14)>
<11, (8, 14, 1)>
<14, (9, 11, 13)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
