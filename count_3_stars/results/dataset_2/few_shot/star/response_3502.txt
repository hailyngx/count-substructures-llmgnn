Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 14: <14, (17, 3, 1)>
2. Node 17: <17, (14, 29, 13)> 
3. Node 3: No 3-star as it is only connected to Node 14.
4. Node 25: No 3-star as it is only connected to Node 21.
5. Node 7: <7, (0, 27, 2)>
6. Node 21: No 3-star as it is only connected to Node 25.
7. Node 0: <0, (7, 27, 10)> 
8. Node 27: <27, (7, 0, 12)> 
9. Node 12: <12, (27, 4, 5)>
10. Node 2: <2, (7, 18, 5)>
11. Node 18: <18, (21, 2, 23)>
12. Node 5: <5, (12, 2, 6)> 
13. Node 6: <6, (27, 5, 28)>
14. Node 29: <29, (17, 15, 4)> 
15. Node 26: <26, (17, 11, 8)>
16. Node 28: <28, (6, 9, 1)> 
17. Node 24: <24, (26, 11, 23)> 
18. Node 11: <11, (26, 4, 24)> 
19. Node 16: No 3-star as it is only connected to Node 5. 
20. Node 8: No 3-star as it is only connected to Nodes 6 and 26. 
21. Node 9: No 3-star as it is only connected to Nodes 28 and 20. 
22. Node 13: No 3-star as it is only connected to Nodes 17 and 16. 
23. Node 4: <4, (12, 29, 24)> 
24. Node 1: <1, (14, 18, 28)> 
25. Node 15: <15, (14, 29, 1)>
26. Node 10: <10, (0, 29, 15)> 
27. Node 23: <23, (0, 18, 24)>
28. Node 20: <20, (9, 22)> 
29. Node 22: <22, (17, 15, 20)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
