Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying the central nodes of the 3-stars. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:  
  - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 9, Node 11, and Node 12 are all connected to exactly 5 other nodes, so they cannot be central nodes of a 3-star.
  - Node 10 is connected to 6 other nodes, so it also cannot be a central node of a 3-star.
  - Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 14 are connected to fewer than 3 other nodes, so they cannot be central nodes of a 3-star either.

3. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - <5, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <9, (0, 5, 10)>
   - <11, (5, 12, 14)>
   - <12, (1, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
