Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, identify the 3-stars it is a part of:
   
   - Node 0: None
   - Node 1: None
   - Node 2: None
   - Node 3: None
   - Node 4: {(4, 15, 7), (4, 15, 6), (4, 15, 14)}
   - Node 5: None
   - Node 6: {(6, 15, 18), (6, 15, 0), (6, 15, 12)}
   - Node 7: None
   - Node 8: None
   - Node 9: None
   - Node 10: {(10, 4, 15), (10, 4, 11), (10, 4, 14)}
   - Node 11: None
   - Node 12: None
   - Node 13: None
   - Node 14: {(14, 3, 10), (14, 3, 5), (14, 3, 15)}
   - Node 15: None
   - Node 16: None
   - Node 17: None
   - Node 18: None
   - Node 19: None

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:

   - Total 3-stars: [6]

3. List the unique 3-stars found:

   - <4, 15, 7>
   - <4, 15, 6>
   - <4, 15, 14>
   - <6, 15, 18>
   - <6, 15, 0>
   - <6, 15, 12>
