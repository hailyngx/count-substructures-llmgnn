Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (5, 1, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 14)>
<8, (4, 6, _)>
<9, (5, 11, 0)>
<14, (1, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-stars listed above:
