Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, I will identify the 3-stars in this graph according to the definition provided. Each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Given the adjacency list and edges provided, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, (6, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (5, 9, 6)>
3. <2, (9, 6, 1)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 1)>
5. <4, (5, 8, 2)>
6. <5, (8, 1, 4)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 2)>
8. <8, (5, 6, 3)>
9. <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
