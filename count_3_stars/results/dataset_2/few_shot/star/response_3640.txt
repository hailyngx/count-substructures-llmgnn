Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars around a central node. 

Based on the information provided, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
