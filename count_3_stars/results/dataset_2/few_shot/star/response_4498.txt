Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through each node to identify all the 3-stars: 

1. Node 0: No 3-stars.
2. Node 1: <1, (6, 9, 3)>.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars.
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 11, 10)>.
5. Node 4: <4, (9, 1, 14)> and <4, (9, 1, 13)>.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars.
10. Node 9: <9, (4, 1, 13)>.
11. Node 10: No 3-stars.
12. Node 11: <11, (1, 3, 10)> and <11, (1, 3, 8)>.
13. Node 12: No 3-stars.
14. Node 13: No 3-stars.
15. Node 14: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 11, 10)>, <4, (9, 1, 14)>, <4, (9, 1, 13)>, <9, (4, 1, 13)>.
