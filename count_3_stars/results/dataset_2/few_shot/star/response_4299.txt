Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. These nodes have exactly 3 neighbors.

Central nodes: 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25

Now, let's find the 3-stars by considering each central node and its neighboring nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

<5, (6, 18, 26)>
<6, (5, 18, 28)>
<12, (15, 25, 26)>
<13, (1, 7, 26)>
<15, (12, 16, 17)>
<16, (15, 17, 22)>
<17, (15, 16, 8)>
<18, (5, 6, 19)>
<22, (16, 19, 25)>
<25, (12, 19, 22)>

So, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
