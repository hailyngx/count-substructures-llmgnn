Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and its neighbors, and then check if they form a 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
