Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

For each node:
1. Check its neighbors to see if there are any 3-star patterns centered at this node.
2. Keep track of the identified 3-stars.

Let's go through each node to find all the unique 3-star patterns:

<5, (19, 15, 3)>
<10, (11, 6, 1)>
<11, (10, 1, 18)>
<7, (12, 3, 2)>
<12, (5, 7, 17)>
<15, (5, 8, 16)>
<17, (12, 2, 8)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<8, (15, 17, 18)>
<6, (10, 12, 19)>
<2, (7, 0, 17)>
<3, (5, 7, 12)>
<13, (10, 7, 19)>
<16, (14, 15, 6)>
<4, (0, 17, 12)>
<18, (11, 8, 17)>
<0, (2, 4, 17)>
<14, (12, 16)>
<19, (5, 13, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star patterns found, we get a total of [19].
