Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 13, 4, 12, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 11, 12, 3, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 11, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 10, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 10, 8, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 13, 14, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 10, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 8, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 13, 4, and node 2

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, and 14
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 13
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 14

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  

<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 13, 14)>
<10, (7, 9, 13)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
