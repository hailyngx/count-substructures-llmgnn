Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's look at the graph and find all the 3-stars:

1. <1, (5, 9, 3)>
2. <4, (5, 8, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 7)>
4. <6, (4, 8, 3)>

After identifying all the 3-stars, we count them to get the total number of 3-stars. The final count is [4].
