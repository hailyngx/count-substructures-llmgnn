Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2)

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 10, 3, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 11, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 10, 14, 0, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 12, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 11, 2, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (13, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 10, 3)>
<10, (5, 9, 4)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<12, (9, 13, 14)>
<13, (8, 12, 2)>
<14, (7, 11, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
