Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star and the adjacency list provided for each node, we can determine each unique 3-star in the graph using the information about node connections. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 10 in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
