Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Based on the definition provided, a 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 2: <2, (1, 3, 13)>
- From node 4: <4, (7, 9, 17)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 9, 12)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 13, 19)>
- From node 7: <7, (4, 15, 17)>
- From node 9: <9, (2, 4, 17)>
- From node 10: <10, (12, 14, 0)>
- From node 12: <12, (8, 5, 10)>
- From node 14: <14, (16, 5, 18)>
- From node 16: <16, (0, 14, 19)>
- From node 17: <17, (7, 4, 18)>
- From node 18: <18, (11, 14, 17)>
- From node 19: <19, (1, 6, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. As we have listed unique 3-stars above, we count a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
