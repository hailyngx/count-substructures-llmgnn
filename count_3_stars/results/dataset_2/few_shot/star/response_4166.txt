Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the following possible 3-stars:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars are listed inside brackets as <central node, (leaf 1, leaf 2, leaf 3)>.
