Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to each node:
Node 15: 27, 8, 12
Node 27: 15, 18, 10, 3, 5
Node 8: 15, 16
Node 16: 1, 13, 8, 24
Node 13: 1, 17, 16, 4
Node 17: 13, 6, 11
Node 6: 17, 29, 25, 3
Node 7: 21, 22
Node 21: 7, 28, 22
Node 22: 7, 21, 18, 0
Node 0: 22, 24
Node 20: 29, 5, 11
Node 29: 20, 6, 26, 25
Node 1: 16, 13
Node 2: 9, 24, 19, 14, 25
Node 3: 27, 12, 6
Node 4: 28, 13
Node 5: 27, 20, 12
Node 18: 27, 22, 14
Node 19: 11, 2
Node 10: 27, 25
Node 11: 20, 17, 9, 19
Node 12: 15, 5, 3
Node 14: 18, 2
Node 23: 26, 24
Node 24: 0, 23, 16, 2
Node 25: 29, 6, 2, 10
Node 26: 29, 23

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[<15, (27, 8, 12)>, <27, (15, 18, 10)>, <27, (15, 3, 5)>, <8, (15, 16, 24)>, <16, (1, 13, 24)>, <13, (1, 17, 16)>, <17, (13, 6, 11)>, <6, (17, 29, 25)>, <7, (21, 22, 28)>, <22, (7, 21, 18)>, <0, (22, 24, 0)>, <20, (29, 5, 11)>, <29, (20, 6, 25)>, <2, (9, 24, 19)>, <3, (27, 12, 6)>, <4, (28, 13, 4)>, <5, (27, 20, 12)>, <18, (27, 22, 14)>, <19, (11, 2, 19)>, <10, (27, 25, 10)>]
