Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 11, 10)>
<7, (4, 17, 19)>
<14, (9, 12, 19)>
<9, (14, 2, 3)>
<10, (11, 3, 18)>
<12, (14, 15, 9)>
<17, (7, 1, 0)>
<18, (10, 5, 16)>
<19, (7, 14, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
