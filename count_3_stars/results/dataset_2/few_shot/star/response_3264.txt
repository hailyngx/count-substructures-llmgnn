Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star configurations can be found by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<7, (9, 14, 2)>
<10, (7, 6, 13)>
<13, (9, 10, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
