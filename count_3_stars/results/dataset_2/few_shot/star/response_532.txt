Response:
Since each 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaf nodes, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Once we identify such nodes, we can construct the 3-stars around them.

The nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 27, 24, and 27
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 19, 19, and 19

Now let's construct the 3-stars around these center nodes:
- For Node 1: 
  <1, (27, 24, 27)>
- For Node 15: 
  <15, (19, 19, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
