Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent the 3-star structures in the graph.

Let's first list out the 3-star structures in the graph:
- <0, (4, 12, 14)>
- <1, (9, 11, 6)>
- <2, (5, 7, 10)>
- <3, (4, 11, 14)>
- <4, (7, 0, 3)>
- <5, (9, 6, 10)>
- <6, (5, 1, 2)>
- <7, (4, 12, 2)>
- <8, (9, 7, _)>
- <9, (5, 8, 11)>
- <10, (5, 11, 12)>
- <11, (9, 10, 3)>
- <12, (9, 7, 10)>
- <13, (6, 14, _)>
- <14, (0, 3, 1)>

From the listed 3-stars, we can now count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [15].
