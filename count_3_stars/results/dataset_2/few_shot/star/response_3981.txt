Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (9, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
