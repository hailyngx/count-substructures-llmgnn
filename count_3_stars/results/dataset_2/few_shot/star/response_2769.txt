Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors since each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check for each of these nodes if they form a 3-star by checking if all the neighbors are connected to each other.

The nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 2, and 0

Checking if these nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 3: (3, 9, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 9) are valid 3-stars.
- Node 4: (4, 5, 9), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 9) are valid 3-stars.
- Node 8: (5, 8, 2), (0, 8, 2), (0, 8, 5) are valid 3-stars.

List of unique 3-stars: 
<3, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 2, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
