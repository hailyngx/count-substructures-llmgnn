Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6)

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Next, we will list the unique 3-stars and count them to determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 2, _)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 3, _)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
