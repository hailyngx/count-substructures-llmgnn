Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node in each potential 3-star: Look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors since this is a characteristic of the center in a 3-star.

Central nodes: 0, 11, 18

2. For each central node:
   - Check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - List the connected nodes as leaves to form a 3-star if the above condition is met.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (15, 8, 19)>
<11, (9, 14, 5)>
<18, (10, 17, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
