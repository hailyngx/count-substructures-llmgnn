Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<List of 3-stars in the graph>
<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 2)>
<6, (9, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<9, (7, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]
