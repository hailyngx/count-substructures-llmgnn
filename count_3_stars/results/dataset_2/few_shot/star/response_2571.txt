Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify unique instances of 3-stars.

1. Node 0 has three neighbors: 9, 1, and 13. It forms a 3-star with each neighbor as the center. So, we have:
   - <0, (9, 1, 13)>
   - <0, (1, 9, 2)>
   - <0, (13, 9, 4)>
   [3]

2. Node 1 has three neighbors: 9, 3, and 4. It forms a 3-star with each neighbor as the center. So, we have:
   - <1, (9, 0, 3)>
   - <1, (3, 1, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 1, 13)>
   [6]

3. Node 2 has three neighbors: 9, 5, and 13. It forms a 3-star with each neighbor as the center. So, we have:
   - <2, (9, 0, 5)>
   - <2, (5, 2, 11)>
   - <2, (13, 2, 4)>
   [9]

4. Node 3 forms two 3-stars with its neighbors. So, we have:
   - <3, (6, 1, 0)>
   - <3, (5, 3, 7)>
   [11]

5. Node 4 has three neighbors: 1, 13, and 14. It forms a 3-star with each neighbor as the center. So, we have:
   - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <4, (13, 4, 2)>
   - <4, (14, 4, 11)>
   [14]

6. Node 5 forms a 3-star only with node 7 as the center. So, we have:
   - <5, (6, 3, 12)>
   [15]

7. Node 8 forms one 3-star with its neighbors. So, we have:
   - <8, (3, 14, 11)>
   [16]

8. Node 9 forms three 3-stars with its neighbors. So, we have:
   - <9, (6, 5, 3)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 13)>
   - <9, (10, 2, 12)>
   [19]

9. Node 10 forms one 3-star with its neighbors. So, we have:
   - <10, (9, 12, 7)>
   [20]

10. Node 11 forms two 3-stars with its neighbors. So, we have:
    - <11, (4, 13, 0)>
    - <11, (14, 8, 5)>
    [22]

11. Node 12 forms one 3-star with its neighbors. So, we have:
    - <12, (3, 7, 11)>
    [23]

12. Node 13 forms two 3-stars with its neighbors. So, we have:
    - <13, (4, 2, 0)>
    - <13, (11, 14, 8)>
    [25]

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
