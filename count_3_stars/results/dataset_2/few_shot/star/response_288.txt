Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all such configurations.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (9, 1, 2)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 0, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 1, -)>
<5, (9, 8, -)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (9, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
