Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 13, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 12, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 13, 0, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 5, 14, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 5, and 4 <1, (9, 5, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, and 10 <4, (6, 8, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 7, and 12 <6, (9, 7, 12)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 13, and 14 <7, (6, 13, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, and 2 <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 14, and 9 <12, (6, 14, 9)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 5, and 14 <13, (6, 5, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
