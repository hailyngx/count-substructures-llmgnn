Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Observation: In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Using this information, we can check each node in the graph to see if there is a 3-star centered at that node.

List of 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (15, 17, 4)>
<3, (17, 14, 20)>
<6, (22, 17, 26)>
<7, (16, 15, 9)>
<8, (11, 13, 23)>
<9, (28, 14, 20)>
<12, (15, 19, 26)>
<13, (8, 4, 1)>
<14, (18, 9, 3)>
<15, (7, 0, 12)>
<16, (7, 2, 4)>
<17, (6, 3, 0)>
<18, (27, 14, 0)>
<19, (8, 12, 26)>
<20, (27, 9, 3)>
<21, (2, 22, 5)>
<22, (29, 6, 21)>
<25, (29, 10, 1)>
<26, (27, 20, 12)>
<27, (18, 20, 26)>
<28, (29, 9, 7)>
<29, (28, 25, 22)>

Count of 3-stars: 22
