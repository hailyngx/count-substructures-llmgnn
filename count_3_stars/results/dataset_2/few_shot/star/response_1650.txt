Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars.

Let's list out the 3-stars we find:
<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 5)>
<3, (9, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
