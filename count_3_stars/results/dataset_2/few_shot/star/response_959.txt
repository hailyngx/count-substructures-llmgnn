Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them step-by-step:

1. Starting with Node 0:
   - <0, (27, 14, 7)>
   - <0, (27, 18, 13)>

2. Moving to Node 27:
   - <27, (0, 14, 8)>
   - <27, (0, 18, 5)>

3. Now, let's consider Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 12, 29)>
   - <7, (0, 18, 9)>
   
4. Continuing with Node 8:
   - <8, (27, 10, 4)>
   - <8, (27, 8, 28)>
   
5. Considering Node 10:
   - <10, (8, 11, 1)>
   - <10, (8, 10, 24)>
   
6. Moving on to Node 21:
   - <21, (4, 6, 3)>
   - <21, (3, 21, 25)>
   
7. Finally, Node 9:
   - <9, (22, 23, 7)>
   - <9, (22, 23, 24)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above gives [12].
