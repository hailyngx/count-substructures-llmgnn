Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

1. From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node.
2. A 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to the central node.
3. We will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

From the given graph, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

<0, (14, 5, 13)>
<1, (3, 14, 4)>
<2, (11, 5, 0)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<4, (1, 5, 13)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (10, 0, 14)>
<7, (14, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<10, (6, 9, 14)>
<11, (3, 10, 9)>
