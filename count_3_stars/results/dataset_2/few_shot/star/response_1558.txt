Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then count the total number of such 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (9, 11, 5)>
<1, (10, 2, 12)>
<2, (1, 16, 19)>
<3, (15, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (9, 11, 4)>
<6, (14, 17, 13)>
<7, (3, 8, 19)>
<8, (10, 12, 7)>
<9, (5, 13, 0)>
<10, (15, 1, 4)>
<11, (17, 5, 0)>
<12, (3, 8, 4)>
<13, (9, 19, 18)>
<14, (17, 6, 14)>
<15, (3, 10, 18)>
<16, (2, 19, 16)>
<17, (14, 6, 11)>
<18, (15, 18, 13)>
<19, (13, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
