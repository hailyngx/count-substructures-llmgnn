Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors.
Nodes 0, 1, and 7 have less than 3 neighbors, so we can exclude them from consideration. Nodes 2, 8, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors, so we can also exclude them. 
This leaves us with nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as potential central nodes for 3-stars. 

Step 2: Verify if the remaining nodes are central nodes of 3-stars.
Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 have 5, 5, 6, and 4 neighbors, respectively. 
By observing their neighbors, we can see that nodes 4 and 6 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, confirming that they are central nodes of 3-stars. 

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars. 
There are 2 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
