Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes forming a star configuration. We will list the unique 3-stars found below:

[<5, (9, 1, 0)>]
[<9, (5, 8, 3)>]
[<4, (7, 0, 6)>]
[<7, (9, 4, 0)>]
[<1, (5, 9, 3)>]
[<3, (5, 9, 4)>]
[<8, (9, 7, 1)>]
[<2, (3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
