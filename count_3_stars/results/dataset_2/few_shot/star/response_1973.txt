Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the nodes that are connected in the pattern of a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify which nodes form a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows: 
<8, (4, 20, 3)>
<11, (18, 27, 28)>
<10, (22, 17, 12)>
<5, (15, 29, 7)>
<9, (26, 6, 28)>
<13, (26, 16, 24)>
<21, (1, 0, 22)>
<3, (6, 8, 14)>
<12, (15, 10, 24)>
<7, (13, 29, 5)>
<16, (9, 26, 13)>
<19, (10, 20, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
