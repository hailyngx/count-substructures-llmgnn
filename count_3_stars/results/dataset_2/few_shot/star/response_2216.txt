Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0: (27, 28, 2)
- Node 1: (24, 14, 10)
- Node 4: (13, 17, 10)
- Node 8: (6, 20, 17)
- Node 9: (6, 28, 16)
- Node 11: (22, 19, 15)
- Node 12: (24, 19, 14)
- Node 19: (11, 15, 12)
- Node 20: (8, 2, 27)
- Node 21: (7, 27, 2)
- Node 22: (26, 11, 19)
- Node 27: (21, 0, 2)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (27, 28, 2)>
<1, (24, 14, 10)>
<4, (13, 17, 10)>
<8, (6, 20, 17)>
<9, (6, 28, 16)>
<11, (22, 19, 15)>
<12, (24, 19, 14)>
<19, (11, 15, 12)>
<20, (8, 2, 27)>
<21, (7, 27, 2)>
<22, (26, 11, 19)>
<27, (21, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
