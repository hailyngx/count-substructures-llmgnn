Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 4, 16, and node 19
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 18
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 1, 18, 13, and node 14

Node 19 is connected to node 7, 0, 13, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<15, (10, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 2, 18)>
<10, (4, 13, 15)>
<18, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (15, 12, 19)>
<4, (0, 5, 10)>
<8, (3, 6, 18)>
<9, (13, 15, 9)>
<12, (7)>
<5, (4)>
<6, (8, 19)>
<16, (14, 0, 18)>
<17, (7)>
<13, (9, 14, 19)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
