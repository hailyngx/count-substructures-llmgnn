Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (8, 1, 3)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 2)>
3. <2, (6, 8, 5)>
4. <3, (6, 8, 0)>
5. <4, (7, 9, 1)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 0)>
7. <6, (4, 9, 3)>
8. <7, (4, 9, 1)>
9. <8, (7, 9, 2)>
10. <9, (4, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
