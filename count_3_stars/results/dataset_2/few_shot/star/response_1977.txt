Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (9, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [10].
