Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with the selected node as the center.

In this graph, the potential central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Let's identify the 3-star configurations with the central nodes:

- For central node 0: <0, (4, 7, 14)>, <0, (4, 11, 14)>, <0, (4, 6, 14)>, <0, (7, 4, 11)>, <0, (7, 4, 6)>, <0, (7, 14, 6)>, <0, (11, 4, 14)>, <0, (11, 14, 6)>, <0, (6, 4, 11)>, <0, (6, 14, 5)>, <0, (14, 7, 11)>, <0, (14, 11, 6)>
  
- For central node 1: <1, (2, 6, 10)>, <1, (2, 10, 13)>, <1, (6, 0, 1)>, <1, (6, 1, 10)>, <1, (10, 4, 1)>, <1, (10, 1, 6)>, <1, (13, 12, 1)>, <1, (13, 1, 11)>
  
- For central node 2: <2, (0, 14, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <2, (14, 6, 2)>, <2, (14, 2, 1)>, <2, (8, 2, 3)>
  
- For central node 3: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
  
- For central node 4: <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (7, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 11)>
  
- For central node 5: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
  
- For central node 6: <6, (0, 14, 1)>, <6, (0, 6, 10)>, <6, (14, 6, 1)>, <6, (1, 6, 10)>
  
- For central node 7: <7, (4, 0, 10)>, <7, (4, 7, 12)>, <7, (4, 10, 9)>, <7, (0, 7, 14)>
  
- For central node 8: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
  
- For central node 9: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 1 node.
  
- For central node 10: <10, (4, 7, 1)>, <10, (4, 7, 6)>, <10, (7, 0, 10)>, <10, (7, 10, 9)>, <10, (1, 6, 10)>
  
- For central node 11: <11, (4, 0, 14)>, <11, (4, 13, 11)>, <11, (0, 14, 11)>, <11, (14, 11, 5)>
  
- For central node 12: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 1 node.
  
- For central node 13: No 3-star configuration as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
  
- For central node 14: <14, (0, 11, 6)>, <14, (0, 14, 5)>, <14, (11, 4, 14)>, <14, (11, 13, 14)>, <14, (11, 14, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
