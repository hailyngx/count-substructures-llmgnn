Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To have a 3-star, we need a center node and three connected nodes to it.

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
