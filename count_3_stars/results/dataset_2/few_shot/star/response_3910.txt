Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all cases where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (27, 21, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 5, 28)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 29, 25)>
- Node 12: <12, (18, 20, 19)>
- Node 15: <15, (21, 17, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (26, 1, 4)>
- Node 17: <17, (2, 15, 26)>
- Node 18: <18, (27, 26, 12)>
- Node 19: <19, (15, 14, 24)>
- Node 21: <21, (0, 7, 15)>
- Node 22: <22, (23, 24, 1)>
- Node 24: <24, (22, 9, 8)>
- Node 26: <26, (17, 18, 25)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [13].
