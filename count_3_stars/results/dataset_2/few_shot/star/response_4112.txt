Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (8, 1, 17)>
2. <7, (29, 27, 1)>
3. <0, (21, 12, 26)>
4. <27, (2, 9, 26)>
5. <8, (28, 4, 6)>
6. <6, (28, 3, 20)>
7. <28, (6, 3, 18)>
8. <9, (27, 11, 22)>
9. <1, (4, 7, 17)>
10. <17, (4, 19, 5)>
11. <5, (19, 16, 4)>
12. <19, (17, 10, 5)>
13. <11, (9, 22, 18)>
14. <21, (0, 18, 23)>
15. <12, (0, 18, 6)>
16. <13, (10, 24, 6)>
17. <10, (19, 14, 13)>
18. <16, (5, 15, 25)>
19. <25, (21, 10, 16)>
20. <26, (27, 14, 15)>
21. <3, (6, 28, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
