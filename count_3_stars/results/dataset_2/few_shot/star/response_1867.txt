Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes with three connections are:
- Node 2 (connected to 11, 6, 19)
- Node 3 (connected to 6, 1, 10) 
- Node 4 (connected to 16, 8, 0)
- Node 5 (connected to 17, 15, 12)
- Node 6 (connected to 9, 3, 2)
- Node 7 (connected to 17, 15, 14)
- Node 8 (connected to 11, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to 11, 6, 12)
- Node 10 (connected to 16, 3)
- Node 11 (connected to 9, 8, 2)
- Node 12 (connected to 9, 19, 15, 5, 0)
- Node 13 (connected to 1, 7)
- Node 14 (connected to 7, 18, 15)
- Node 15 (connected to 7, 14, 5, 12)
- Node 16 (connected to 4, 10)
- Node 17 (connected to 19, 5, 7)
- Node 18 (connected to 6, 14)
- Node 19 (connected to 3, 17, 2, 12)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <2, (11, 6, 19)>
- <3, (6, 1, 10)>
- <4, (16, 8, 0)>
- <5, (17, 15, 12)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <7, (17, 15, 14)>
- <8, (11, 4, 16)>
- <9, (11, 6, 12)>
- <11, (9, 8, 2)>
- <12, (9, 19, 15, 5)>
- <15, (7, 14, 5, 12)>
- <17, (19, 5, 7)>
- <19, (3, 17, 2, 12)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [13]
