Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9)

Response:
First, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. The key observation here is that for a 3-star, the center node must have exactly three edges.

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <4, (7, 8, 10)>
- <2, (1, 13, 6)>
- <13, (2, 5, 11)>
- <8, (4, 14, 11)>
- <12, (8, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
