Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (8, 18, 15)>
<18, (0, 10, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
