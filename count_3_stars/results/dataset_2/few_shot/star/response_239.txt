Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Based on the given information, we know that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. We will go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star using the given adjacency list.

3. A 3-star can be uniquely identified by its center node and the three connected nodes.

4. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:
   
   <0, (3, 7, 12)>
   <1, (10, 17, 3)>
   <2, (13, 14, 19)>
   <3, (0, 8, 10)>
   <4, (8, 10, 11)>
   <5, (7, 8, 13)>
   <6, (16, 18, 4)>
   <7, (0, 8, 19)>
   <8, (3, 4, 5)>
   <9, (15, 4, 13)>
   <10, (13, 4, 1)>
   <11, (4, 10, 15)>
   <12, (2, 0, 14)>
   <13, (10, 2, 15)>
   <14, (2, 12, 13)>
   <15, (13, 4, 16)>
   <16, (15, 6, 4)>
   <17, (18, 1, 19)>
   <18, (17, 6, 7)>
   <19, (17, 7, 2)>

5. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of 20 unique 3-stars.

6. Finally, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
