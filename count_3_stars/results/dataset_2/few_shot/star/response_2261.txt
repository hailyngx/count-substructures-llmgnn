Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in this graph:
  
  - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, and 7: <6, (9, 5, 7)>
  - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 4: <9, (6, 8, 4)>
  - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 2: <4, (9, 7, 2)>
  - Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 3: <7, (6, 4, 3)>
  - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 4: <1, (9, 8, 4)>
    
Count of 3-stars: [5]
