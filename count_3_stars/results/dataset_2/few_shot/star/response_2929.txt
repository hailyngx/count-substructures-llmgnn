Response:
Let's first identify the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (16, 10, 7)
2. Node 1: (6, 14, 12) or (6, 1, 8) or (14, 1, 10)
3. Node 3: (5, 3, 8)
4. Node 4: (11, 4, 12)
5. Node 5: (11, 5, 13) or (3, 5, 19)
6. Node 7: (15, 7, 17) or (0, 7, 19)
7. Node 8: (3, 8, 13) or (1, 8, 19) or (8, 10, 15)
8. Node 9: (16, 9, 12)
9. Node 10: (15, 10, 17) or (0, 10, 14)
10. Node 11: (16, 11, 5)
11. Node 13: (16, 13, 8) or (5, 13, 18)
12. Node 15: (10, 15, 17) or (7, 15, 18)
13. Node 16: (11, 16, 13) or (16, 9, 0)
14. Node 17: (15, 17, 7)
15. Node 18: (15, 18, 13)
16. Node 19: (8, 19, 7)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 16. Therefore, the answer is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (16, 10, 7)>
<1, (6, 14, 12)>
<1, (6, 1, 8)>
<1, (14, 1, 10)>

<4, (11, 4, 12)>
<5, (11, 5, 13)>
<5, (3, 5, 19)>
<7, (15, 7, 17)>
<7, (0, 7, 19)>
<8, (3, 8, 13)>
<8, (1, 8, 19)>
<8, (8, 10, 15)>
<9, (16, 9, 12)>
