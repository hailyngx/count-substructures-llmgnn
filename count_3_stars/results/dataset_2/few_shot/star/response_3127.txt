Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are connected to three other nodes are:
- Node 0 is connected to node 17, 11, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to node 13, 0, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 15, 5, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and 16.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6, 14, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6, 17, and 18.
- Node 16 is connected to node 5, 10, and 19.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (17, 11, 18)>
<2, (13, 0, 7)>
<4, (15, 5, 1)>
<5, (6, 13, 16)>
<7, (6, 14, 18)>
<8, (6, 17, 18)>
<16, (5, 10, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
