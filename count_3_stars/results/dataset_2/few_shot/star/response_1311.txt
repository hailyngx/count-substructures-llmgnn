Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the adjacency list provided, we can see the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 16.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- There are 2 unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 8, 16)> and <5, (9, 14, 16)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (5, 18, 15)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star with node 15 as the center: <15, (9, 19, 18)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star with node 18 as the center: <18, (9, 0, 17)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star with node 11 as the center: <11, (9, 19, 18)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star with node 13 as the center: <13, (1, 15, 16)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
