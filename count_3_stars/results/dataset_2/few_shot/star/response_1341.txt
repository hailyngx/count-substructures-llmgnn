Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by inspecting each node and its connections to find if there are any instances of a 3-star centered at that node. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph along with their central node and leaf nodes. Let's count them and put the final count inside brackets:

<0, (2, 12, 10)>
<1, (2, 4, 11)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 13, 0)>
<5, (13, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 13)>
<8, (2, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 11, 7)>
<11, (9, 8, 14)>
<12, (8, 14, 0)>
<13, (5, 6, 14)>
<14, (5, 13, 12)>

There are a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
