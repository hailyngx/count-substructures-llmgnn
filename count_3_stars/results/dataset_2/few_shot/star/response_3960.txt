Node 2 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 13, 12, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 12, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 14, and node 13

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

The nodes along with their connections can be visualized as follows:
- 0: {1, 3, 7, 8}
- 1: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- 2: {4, 6, 13}
- 3: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- 4: {1, 2, 6, 12, 13}
- 5: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- 6: {2, 4, 8, 9, 14}
- 7: {0, 1, 3, 10}
- 8: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- 9: {5, 6, 13, 14}
- 10: {5, 7, 11}
- 11: {10, 12}
- 12: {4, 5, 11, 14}
- 13: {2, 4, 9, 14}
- 14: {6, 9, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 10, 12)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 14)>
3. <6, (9, 4, 8)>
4. <12, (5, 11, 14)>
5. <4, (1, 13, 2)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
