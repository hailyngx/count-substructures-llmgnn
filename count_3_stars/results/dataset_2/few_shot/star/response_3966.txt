Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 
We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

Based on the provided adjacency list and edge information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (8, 2, 7)>
<0, (8, 1, 9)>
<1, (8, 0, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 0, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<4, (8, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
