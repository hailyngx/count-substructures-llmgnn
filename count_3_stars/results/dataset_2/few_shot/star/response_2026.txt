Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 18, 16.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 16.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 1.

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 12, 19, 6.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 10.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 3.

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, 17.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 12)>.

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 14.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 5.

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 15.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 6.

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 7.

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 17.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 8.

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 16.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (5, 11, 16)>.

11. For Node 10:
    - Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 19, 12.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 10.

12. For Node 11:
    - Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 18, 3.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 11.

13. For Node 12:
    - Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 17, 10, 15.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 12: <12, (4, 10, 15)>.

16. For Node 15:
    - Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 19, 12, 6.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 15.

17. For Node 16:
    - Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, 0.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 16: <16, (9, 8, 1)>.

18. For Node 17:
    - Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 1, 12.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 17.

19. For Node 18:

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<9, (5, 11, 16)>
