Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the 3-stars can be formed as follows:
- For node 0: <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- For node 1: <1, (9, 10, 12)> and <1, (0, 10, 2)>
- For node 2: <2, (10, 7, 5)> and <2, (1, 7, 4)>
- For node 3: <3, (9, 10, 12)> and <3, (5, 10, 14)>
- For node 4: <4, (11, 0, 2)>
- For node 5: <5, (13, 0, 2)> and <5, (3, 10, 14)>
- For node 6: <6, (7, 12, 8)>
- For node 7: <7, (6, 10, 8)> and <7, (2, 10, 12)>
- For node 8: <8, (6, 11, 13)> and <8, (7, 11, 4)>
- For node 9: <9, (14, 3, 1)>
- For node 10: <10, (3, 7, 1)> and <10, (2, 7, 5)>
- For node 11: <11, (14, 8, 4)>
- For node 12: <12, (6, 7, 3)> and <12, (1, 7, 2)>
- For node 13: <13, (8, 5, 14)>
- For node 14: <14, (9, 10, 11)> and <14, (5, 10, 13)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
