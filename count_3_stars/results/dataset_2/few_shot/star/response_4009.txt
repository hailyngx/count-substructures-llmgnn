Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <3, (15, 9, 12)>
- <15, (3, 1, 11)>
- <4, (3, 12, 11)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 19, 0)>
- <10, (7, 13, 2)>
- <12, (3, 15, 4)>
- <16, (9, 0, 2)>
- <18, (1, 10, 17)>
- <19, (8, 11, 1)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.
These 3-stars are <3, (15, 9, 12)>, <15, (3, 1, 11)>, <4, (3, 12, 11)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 19, 0)>, <10, (7, 13, 2)>, <12, (3, 15, 4)>, <16, (9, 0, 2)>, <18, (1, 10, 17)>, <19, (8, 11, 1)>.
