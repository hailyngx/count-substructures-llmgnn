Response:
We know that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it is the central node of a 3-star by checking if it has exactly three neighbors.
2. If a node satisfies the condition, find the three nodes it is connected to.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<7, (13, 16, 21)>
<11, (10, 16, 24)>
<12, (10, 22, 6)>
<0, (25, 8, 18)>
<1, (14, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 1, 22)>
<5, (2, 16, 17)>
<6, (22, 4, 27)>
<8, (28, 0, 18)>
<9, (20, 15, 23)>
<10, (11, 12, 22)>
<13, (7, 16, 21)>
<14, (20, 26, 1)>
<15, (9, 3, 29)>
<16, (11, 24, 17)>
<17, (16, 5, 3)>
<18, (17, 0, 29)>
<19, (3, 28, 27)>
<20, (14, 25, 9)>
<21, (13, 2, 29)>
<22, (12, 6, 10)>
<23, (29, 9, 20)>
<24, (16, 2, 2)>
<25, (20, 27, 0)>
<26, (14, 2, 2)>
<27, (25, 6, 28)>
<28, (8, 27, 19)>
<29, (23, 15, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
