Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, thus forming a 3-star. 

Checking the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 7, 23)>
<9, (6, 21, 1)>
<14, (28, 29, 12)>
<23, (6, 8, 18)>
<2, (18, 12, 27)>
<18, (23, 28, 2)>
<15, (20, 16, 12)>
<20, (8, 22, 19)>
<21, (9, 0, 27)>
<12, (2, 29, 3)>
<11, (17, 24, 1)>
<19, (20, 22, 4)>
<26, (8, 24, 25)>
<28, (14, 23, 18)>
<10, (1, 25, 13)>
<1, (11, 29, 25)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
