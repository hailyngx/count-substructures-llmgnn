Response:
The center node in a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify the center nodes first:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 10, and 2
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 13, 0, 11, and 19
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 7, 1, 14, and 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 9, 0, 16, and 11
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 15, 12, and 19
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 11, 3, and 17
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 10, and 12
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 15, and 19
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, and 2
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 8, 6, and 16
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 5, 17, and 2
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 9, 17, 6, and 18
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 4, 14, 12, and 18
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 7, 13, and 15
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 9, 6, and 2

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (4, 10, 2)>
<2, (13, 0, 11)>
<3, (7, 1, 14)>
<4, (9, 0, 16)>
<6, (5, 15, 12)>
<7, (11, 3, 17)>
<8, (3, 10, 12)>
<9, (4, 15, 19)>
<12, (8, 6, 16)>
<13, (5, 17, 2)>
<15, (9, 17, 6)>
<16, (4, 14, 18)>
<17, (7, 13, 15)>
<18, (16, 15)>
<19, (9, 6, 2)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
