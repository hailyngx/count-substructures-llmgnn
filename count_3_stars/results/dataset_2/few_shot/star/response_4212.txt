Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 8) (5, 17) (5, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 17) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 15)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<16, (11, 3, 13)>
<1, (11, 16, 17)>
<17, (10, 5, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
