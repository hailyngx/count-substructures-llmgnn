Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars, where each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 12, 20)>
<1, (14, 16, 18)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (25, 26, 29)>
<4, (2, 9, 22)>
<5, (2, 7, 22)>
<6, (14, 25, 26)>
<7, (0, 5, 28)>
<8, (11, 12, 13)>
<9, (4, 13, 15)>
<10, (18, 27, 29)>
<11, (5, 8, 28)>
<12, (0, 8, 23)>
<13, (8, 9, 15)>
<14, (1, 26, 6)>
<15, (10, 13, 19)>
<16, (1, 28, 17)>
<17, (16, 28, 7)>
<18, (1, 10, 23)>
<19, (15, 23, 18)>
<20, (0, 27, 7)>
<21, (26, 28, 22)>
<22, (21, 4, 5)>
<23, (12, 18, 19)>
<24, (22, 27, 4)>
<25, (3, 6, 7)>
<26, (3, 14, 21)>
<27, (20, 10, 24)>
<28, (10, 16, 9)>
<29, (3, 10, 21)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [30].
