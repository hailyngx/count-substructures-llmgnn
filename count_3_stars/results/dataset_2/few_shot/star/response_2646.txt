Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can iterate over each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Let's start by analyzing each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 6. <0, (8, 4, 6)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 3. <1, (9, 6, 3)>
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, and 5. <3, (8, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 0. <5, (3, 7, 0)>
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7. <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 6. <7, (5, 8, 6)>
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 7. <8, (3, 0, 7)>
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8. <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

<0, (8, 4, 6)>, <1, (9, 6, 3)>, <3, (8, 1, 5)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
