Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by following the definition provided.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (8, 1, 3)>
2. <1, (6, 9, 0)>
3. <2, (6, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (9, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 3)>
6. <5, (7, 3, 5)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 7)>
8. <7, (6, 9, 4)>
9. <8, (4, 2, 0)>
10. <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
