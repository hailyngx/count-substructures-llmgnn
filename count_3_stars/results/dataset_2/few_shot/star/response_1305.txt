Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars are:
<1, (27, 20, 7)>
<2, (27, 29, 18)>
<4, (28, 5, -)>
<5, (8, 12, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 22)>
<8, (18, 5, 25)>
<9, (17, 23, -)>
<10, (11, 13, 20)>
<11, (10, 6, 17)>
<12, (13, 16, 5)>
<13, (26, 10, 12)>
<14, (15, 21, -)>
<16, (26, 19, 25)>
<17, (9, 11, 2)>
<18, (2, 21, 8)>
<19, (24, 16, 23)>
<20, (26, 1, 10)>
<21, (18, 14, 24)>
<22, (-, -, 7)>
<23, (9, 0, 19)>
<24, (28, 21, 19)>
<25, (0, 8, 16)>
<26, (13, 28, 20)>
<27, (15, 2, 1)>
<28, (26, 13, 4)>
<29, (-, -, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[26] 

So, the final answer is [26].
