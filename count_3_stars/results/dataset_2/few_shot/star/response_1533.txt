Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. From the adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are: node 4, node 6, and node 2.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

For node 4:
- (4, 1, 12) forms a 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 1, 12 as leaves. 
<4, (1, 12)>

For node 6:
- (6, 3, 5) forms a 3-star with node 6 as the central node and nodes 3, 5 as leaves. 
<6, (3, 5)>

For node 2:
- (2, 8, 13) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 8, 13 as leaves. 
<2, (8, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
