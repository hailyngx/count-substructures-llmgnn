Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 4, 3)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 1, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 5: <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 6, 0)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 3, 1)>

Since each 3-star is counted once for each central node, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
