Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations around a central node. A 3-star is formed when one central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like shape.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Central node: 0
   Connected nodes: 4, 7, 3
   3-star: <0, (4, 7, 3)>

2. Central node: 1
   Connected nodes: 4, 8, 10
   3-star: <1, (4, 8, 10)>

3. Central node: 6
   Connected nodes: 9, 11, 12
   3-star: <6, (9, 11, 12)>

4. Central node: 8
   Connected nodes: 6, 13, 14
   3-star: <8, (6, 13, 14)>

5. Central node: 13
   Connected nodes: 6, 12, 2
   3-star: <13, (6, 12, 2)>

6. Central node: 14 
   Connected nodes: 5, 11, 8
   3-star: <14, (5, 11, 8)>

Counting the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
