Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Once we find such instances, we will count them as 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, the possible 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<1, (6, 3, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (8, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 3, 0)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
