Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Given the adjacency list, let's identify the unique 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 14, 6)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>
<5, (4, 10, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars we found inside brackets []:
