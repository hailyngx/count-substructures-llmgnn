Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

**Step 1:** Identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star structure. These nodes will have 3 neighbors connected to them by edges.

Nodes involved in 3-star structures:
- Node 5: connected to nodes 23, 6, and 25
- Node 14: connected to nodes 17, 22, and 21
- Node 26: connected to nodes 22, 13, and 21
- Node 16: connected to nodes 27, 15, and 1
- Node 24: connected to nodes 29, 15, and 9

**Step 2:** For each of the identified nodes in Step 1, count the number of unique 3-stars they are part of.

Let's start with Node 5:
- **Node 5:** Connected to nodes 23, 6, and 25
    <5, (23, 6, 25)>
    [1]

Moving on to the other identified nodes:
- **Node 14:** Connected to nodes 17, 22, and 21
    <14, (17, 22, 21)>
- **Node 26:** Connected to nodes 22, 13, and 21
    <26, (22, 13, 21)>
- **Node 16:** Connected to nodes 27, 15, and 1
    <16, (27, 15, 1)>
- **Node 24:** Connected to nodes 29, 15, and 9
    <24, (29, 15, 9)>
