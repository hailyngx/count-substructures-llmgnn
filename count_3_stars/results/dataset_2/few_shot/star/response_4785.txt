Response:
Step 1: Identify possible 3-stars based on the given graph.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 6, 12, and 11. Hence, <5, (6, 12, 11)> is a possible 3-star.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 5, 12, and 11. Hence, <6, (5, 12, 11)> is a possible 3-star.
- Node 10 has edges with nodes 8, 0, and 12. Hence, <10, (8, 0, 12)> is a possible 3-star.
- Node 12 has edges with nodes 5, 6, and 17. Hence, <12, (5, 6, 17)> is a possible 3-star.
- Node 14 has edges with nodes 4, 0, and 13. Hence, <14, (4, 0, 13)> is a possible 3-star.
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 14 and 10. Since it doesn't have a third node connected, it cannot form a 3-star.

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
- There are 5 unique 3-stars identified in the given graph.
