Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 14, 7)>
<3, (1, 11, 4)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<7, (8, 13, 11)>
<9, (3, 10, 14)>
<10, (11, 12, 4)>
<11, (3, 10, 7)>
<12, (3, 13, 10)>
<13, (12, 14, 7)>
<14, (13, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
