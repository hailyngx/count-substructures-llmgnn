Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Node 1: Forms one 3-star <1, (9, 4, 2)>.
3. Node 2: Forms one 3-star <2, (9, 7, 1)>.
4. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
5. Node 4: Forms one 3-star <4, (9, 7, 1)>.
6. Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
10. Node 9: Forms one 3-star <9, (5, 4, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>.
