Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's consider each node as the center of a potential 3-star and count how many 3-stars are present in the given graph.

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 5, 7)> 
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star can be formed.
4. Node 3: <3, (6, 9, 4)>
5. Node 4: <4, (6, 3, 1)>
6. Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 7)>
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 3)>
8. Node 7: <7, (8, 5, 0)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed.
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
<0, (9, 5, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <4, (6, 3, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <7, (8, 5, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>
