Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Then we can count how many such 3-stars exist.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- <5, (9, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
