Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and consider them as the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we can form 3-stars around these central nodes using their neighbors.

First, let's identify the nodes that can serve as the central node of a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (10, 3, and 15)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 19, and 15)
- Node 5 has 0 neighbors and cannot be a central node
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors and cannot be a central node
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors and cannot be a central node
- Nodes 7, 9, and 11 have 2 neighbors each and cannot be central nodes

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Central node 0: <0, (10, 3, 15)>
- Central node 4: <4, (1, 19, 15)>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
