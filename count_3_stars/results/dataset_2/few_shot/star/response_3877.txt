Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (16, 5, 2)>
<3, (17, 4, 5)>
<7, (14, 15, 13)>
<13, (7, 19, 6)>
<15, (16, 14, 10)>
<17, (11, 14, 3)>
<18, (8, 19, 15)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [7].
