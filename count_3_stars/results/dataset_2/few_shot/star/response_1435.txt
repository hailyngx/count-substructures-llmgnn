Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 13, 14, 10, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 13, 2, 14, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 12, 0, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 1, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 2, 5, 12, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 14, 5, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, 14, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 11, 3, 1, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, 3, 1, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We will first list out all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 13, 14)>
<0, (9, 10, 14)>
<0, (13, 3, 14)>
<1, (6, 13, 2)>
<1, (6, 14, 2)>
<1, (13, 2, 14)>
<1, (13, 4, 14)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (13, 12, 0)>
<3, (13, 14, 0)>
<3, (12, 14, 0)>
<4, (11, 1, 10)>
<5, (8, 10, 5)>
<5, (8, 12, 7)>
<6, (9, 11, 1)>
<7, (8, 12, 7)>
<8, (13, 2, 1)>
<8, (13, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 14, 2)>
<10, (0, 14, 5)>
<11, (6, 13, 4)>
<12, (6, 7, 8)>
<13, (8, 11, 4)>
<14, (9, 1, 6)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars which is [25].
