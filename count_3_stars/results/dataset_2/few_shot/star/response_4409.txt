Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Once we have these 3-stars, we can count them.

Based on the given adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<13, (22, 8, 1)>
<13, (22, 8, 15)>
<13, (8, 1, 15)>
<22, (13, 19, 20)>
<9, (26, 6, 8)>
<9, (26, 6, 12)>
<9, (26, 8, 12)>
<26, (9, 24, 5)>
<26, (9, 24, 3)>
<26, (9, 5, 3)>
<0, (10, 27, 16)>
<7, (21, 6, 23)>
<21, (7, 17, 29)>
<6, (9, 17, 18)>
<23, (8, 14, 1)>
<18, (6, 25, 29)>
<14, (23, 2, 1)>
<16, (20, 10, 27)>
<5, (26, 27, 24)>
<4, (24, 12, 15)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
