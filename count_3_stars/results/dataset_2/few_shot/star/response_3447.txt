Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each node in the graph.
2. Check which combinations of nodes form a 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<1, 4, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9, 12>
<2, 13, 14, 3>
<6, 10, 11, 8>
<7, 14, 1, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
