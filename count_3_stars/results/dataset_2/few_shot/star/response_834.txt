Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
2. From node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>
3. From node 4: <4, (9, 7, 0)>
4. From node 7: <7, (5, 9, 4)>
5. From node 1: <1, (7, 0, 0)>
6. From node 3: <3, (9, 2, 8)>
7. From node 8: <8, (5, 3, 0)>
8. From node 6: <6, (4, 8, 2)>
9. From node 0: <0, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
