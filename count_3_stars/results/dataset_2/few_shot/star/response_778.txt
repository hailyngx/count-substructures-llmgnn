Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:
- From the given adjacency list, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 18 have degree 3 or more.
- We will focus on nodes with degree 3 or more since a 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: (0, 15, 18), (0, 15, 8), (0, 18, 8) [<0, (15, 18, 8)>]
- For Node 1: (1, 19, 18), (1, 19, 6), (1, 19, 7), (1, 6, 18), (1, 6, 10), (1, 6, 7), (1, 18, 7) [<1, (19, 18, 6)>, <1, (19, 18, 7)>, <1, (19, 6, 7)>]
- For Node 2: (2, 14, 9), (2, 14, 4), (2, 9, 4) [<2, (14, 9, 4)>]
- For Node 4: (4, 17, 2), (4, 17, 5), (4, 17, 19), (4, 2, 5), (4, 2, 19), (4, 5, 19) [<4, (17, 2, 5)>]
- For Node 6: (6, 1, 18), (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 10), (6, 18, 13), (6, 16, 13) [<6, (1, 18, 7)>]
- For Node 8: (8, 17, 4), (8, 17, 6), (8, 17, 12), (8, 6, 16) [<8, (17, 4, 6)>]
- For Node 10: (10, 6, 1), (10, 6, 7), (10, 6, 13), (10, 7, 18) [<10, (6, 1, 7)>]
- For Node 13: (13, 16, 6), (13, 16, 18), (13, 18, 1) [<13, (16, 6, 18)>]
- For Node 16: (16, 17, 6), (16, 17, 12), (16, 17, 13), (16, 6, 12)  [<16, (17, 6, 12)>]
- For Node 18: (18, 0, 1), (18, 0, 7), (18, 0, 13), (18, 1, 7) [<18, (0, 1, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
