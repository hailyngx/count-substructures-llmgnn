Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For each node in the graph, we need to check if it forms a 3-star with three other nodes by having exactly three edges. If it does, we will list it as a 3-star.

2. Here are the identified 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 5, 16)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 12)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 18)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 19)>
   - <4, (1, 8, 10)>
   - <5, (0, 12, 16)>
   - <6, (2, 9, 17)>
   - <7, (3, 14, -)>
   - <8, (2, 4, -)>
   - <9, (6, 13, 15)>
   - <10, (4, 17, -)>
   - <11, (15, 19, -)>
   - <12, (1, 5, 13)>
   - <13, (1, 9, 18)>
   - <14, (7, -, -)>
   - <15, (9, 11, 19)>
   - <16, (0, 5, 13)>
   - <17, (6, 10, 18)>
   - <18, (2, 13, 17)>
   - <19, (3, 11, 15)>

3. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find there are 20 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [20].
