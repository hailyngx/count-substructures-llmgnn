Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's go through each node and identify the 3-star configurations. A 3-star configuration consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. For Node 0:
   - Possible 3-stars: None

2. For Node 1:
   - Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Possible 3-stars: None

4. For Node 3:
   - Possible 3-stars: None

5. For Node 4:
   - Possible 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>

6. For Node 5:
   - Possible 3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>

7. For Node 6:
   - Possible 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>

8. For Node 7:
   - Possible 3-stars: None

9. For Node 8:
   - Possible 3-stars: <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>

10. For Node 9:
    - Possible 3-stars: None

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>.
