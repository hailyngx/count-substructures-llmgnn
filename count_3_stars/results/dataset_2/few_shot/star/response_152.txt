Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition.

1. Node 0: (3, 8, 5), (3, 5, 9), (3, 8, 9), (5, 8, 9)
2. Node 1: (4, 3, 6)
3. Node 2: (5, 6, 7), (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 9), (6, 2, 9)
4. Node 3: (4, 1, 6), (4, 5, 8), (1, 7, 4)
5. Node 4: (8, 9, 5)
6. Node 5: (0, 7, 2), (0, 6, 2), (0, 7, 9), (7, 6, 9)
7. Node 6: (1, 3, 2)
8. Node 7: (3, 9, 8)
9. Node 8: (4, 5, 9)
10. Node 9: (8, 2, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 

<3, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 2)>, <5, (0, 6, 2)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 2, 7)>, <2, (5, 2, 9)>, <2, (6, 2, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <7, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>
