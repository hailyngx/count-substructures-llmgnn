Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0

Response:
After reviewing the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
