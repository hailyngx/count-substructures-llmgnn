Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star configuration.

Given our definitions:
- A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges.
- The graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

- From Node 4's adjacency list, we have <4, (7, 8, 12)> as it is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 12.
- From Node 7's adjacency list, we have <7, (4, 6, 2)> as it is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 2.
- From Node 8's adjacency list, we have <8, (4, 6, 14)> as it is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 14.
- From Node 12's adjacency list, we have <12, (4, 10, 14)> as it is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 14.
- From Node 5's adjacency list, we have <5, (7, 2, 3)> as it is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 3.
- From Node 13's adjacency list, we have <13, (4, 7, 9)> as it is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- From Node 6's adjacency list, we have <6, (7, 8, 13)> as it is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 13.
- From Node 2's adjacency list, we have <2, (7, 0, 5)> as it is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 5.
- From Node 1's adjacency list, we have <1, (8, 12, 14)> as it is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 14.
- From Node 3's adjacency list, we have <3, (5, 11, 6)> as it is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 6.
- From Node 0's adjacency list, we have <0, (10, 11, 9)> as it is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 9.
