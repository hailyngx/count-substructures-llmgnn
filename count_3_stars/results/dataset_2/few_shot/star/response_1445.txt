Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:

<4, (7, 2, 0)>
<5, (7, 19, 18)>
<8, (15, 9, 11)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<12, (6, 9, 16)>
<13, (8, 19, 0)>
<14, (3, 7, 11)>
<16, (0, 12, 2)>
<19, (13, 17, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
