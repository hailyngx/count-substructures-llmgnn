Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
