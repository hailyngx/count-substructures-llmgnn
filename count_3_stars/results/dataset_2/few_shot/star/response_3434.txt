Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique instances of 3-stars. 

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (6, 14, 1)>
   - <0, (6, 2, 9)>
   - <0, (14, 3, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 12, 7)>
   
2. Node 1:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 1.
   
3. Node 2:
   - <2, (13, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (13, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (13, 9, 7)>
   
4. Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 14, 7)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 12)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 2)>
   - <3, (5, 12, 1)>
   
5. Node 4:
   - No 3-stars centered at node 4.
   
6. Node 5:
   - <5, (11, 13, 6)>
   - <5, (13, 6, 12)>
   - <5, (2, 13, 7)>
   - <5, (13, 7, 2)>
   
7. Node 6:
   - <6, (13, 12, 7)>
   - <6, (13, 12, 1)>
   
8. Node 7:
   - <7, (10, 12, 3)>
   - <7, (10, 12, 1)>
   - <7, (10, 9, 2)>
   - <7, (12, 9, 2)>
   
9. Node 8:
   - <8, (10, 13, 14)>
   
10. Node 9:
    - <9, (10, 7, 2)>
    
11. Node 10:
    - No 3-stars centered at node 10.
    
12. Node 11:
    - <11, (14, 8, 3)>
    
13. Node 12:
    - <12, (8, 6, 7)>
