Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars centered around that particular node.

Upon examining the adjacency list provided, we find the following 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (4, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 6, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 6)
- Node 6: (4, 8, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 9: (1, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
