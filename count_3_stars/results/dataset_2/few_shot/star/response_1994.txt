Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and their adjacent nodes to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-stars.
2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-stars.
3. Node 2: Not part of any 3-stars.
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-stars.
5. Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>
6. Node 5: <5, (13, 12, 11)>
7. Node 6: <6, (8, 14, 7)>
8. Node 7: Not part of any 3-stars.
9. Node 8: <8, (13, 4, 14)> and <8, (6, 7, 10)>
10. Node 9: <9, (4, 14, 10)>
11. Node 10: <10, (9, 1, 8)>
12. Node 11: <11, (5, 13, 3)>
13. Node 12: Not part of any 3-stars.
14. Node 13: <13, (5, 9, 3)>
15. Node 14: Not part of any 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars are: <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <5, (13, 12, 11)>, <6, (8, 14, 7)>, <8, (13, 4, 14)>, <8, (6, 7, 10)>, <9, (4, 14, 10)>, <10, (9, 1, 8)>, and <11, (5, 13, 3)>.
