Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-star configurations can be formed around it. 

The nodes with available 3-star configurations are:
- Node 0: (14, 28, 8), (14, 28, 2), (14, 8, 2)
- Node 1: (11, 16, 28)
- Node 2: (25, 19, 13)
- Node 3: (15, 14, 6)
- Node 4: (21, 5, 13)
- Node 5: (26, 17, 4)
- Node 6: (26, 3, 14), (26, 21, 24), (3, 14, 21), (3, 14, 6), (3, 21, 16), (14, 21, 6)
- Node 11: (20, 19, 4)
- Node 12: (9, 28, 21)
- Node 15: (25, 7, 27)
- Node 18: (10, 16, 24)
- Node 19: (8, 11, 2)
- Node 21: (27, 25, 2), (27, 25, 4), (27, 25, 6), (25, 2, 19), (25, 2, 13), (25, 19, 13)
- Node 23: (10, 29, 18)
- Node 25: (7, 27, 2)
- Node 26: (29, 5, 6)
- Node 28: (1, 13, 2), (1, 13, 4), (1, 4, 13)
- Node 29: (10, 23, 26)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
