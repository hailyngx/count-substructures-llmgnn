Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star structure. 
Here is the breakdown into substeps to identify and count the 3-stars:
1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors as these nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each identified center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If true, form a 3-star structure.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go through each step to find the unique 3-star structures. 

Step 1: Nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 4, 7, 3, 9, and 18.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 1: <4, (7, 14, 1)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 15, 17)>
- Node 14: <14, (4, 15, 13)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 0, 13)>

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 17: <7, (4, 0, 17)>
- Node 4: 3-star already identified
- Node 0: <0, (7, 2, 9)>
- Node 17: <17, (7, 3, 16)>

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 6: <3, (17, 10, 6)>
- Node 17: 3-star already identified
- Node 10: <10, (3, 9, 10)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 18, 12)>

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 12: <9, (8, 0, 12)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 2, _)> (Not a 3-star as it connects to only two nodes)
- Node 0: 3-star already identified
- Node 12: <12, (9, 6, _)>

For Node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 6: <18, (2, 11, 6)>
- Node 2: 3-star already identified
- Node 11: <11, (18, 15, _)>
- Node 6: 3-star already identified

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [8]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [8].
