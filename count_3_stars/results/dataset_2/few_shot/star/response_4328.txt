Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Let's start by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:
- Node 2: <2, (5, 14, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 14, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (8, 4, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (8, 6, 11)>
- Node 6: <6, (12, 1, 10)>

Hence, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6]. 

<2, (5, 14, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 14, 12)>
<12, (8, 4, 6)>
<1, (8, 6, 11)>
<6, (12, 1, 10)>
