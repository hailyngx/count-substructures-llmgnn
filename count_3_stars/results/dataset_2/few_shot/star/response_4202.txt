Response:
The center node and its adjacent nodes in the given graph are as follows:
- Node 0 and its adjacent nodes: 8, 13, 2, and 10
- Node 1 and its adjacent nodes: 3, 14, 5, and 8
- Node 2 and its adjacent nodes: 8, 4, 9, 6, and 0
- Node 3 and its adjacent nodes: 1, 11, 14, and 10
- Node 4 and its adjacent nodes: 13, 12, 2, and 14
- Node 5 and its adjacent nodes: 1, 6, 10, and 14
- Node 6 and its adjacent nodes: 8, 13, 2, and 5
- Node 7 and its adjacent nodes: 11, 14, and 9
- Node 8 and its adjacent nodes: 1, 13, 2, 11, 0, and 6
- Node 9 and its adjacent nodes: 7, 12, 2, and 10
- Node 10 and its adjacent nodes: 3, 5, 0, and 9
- Node 11 and its adjacent nodes: 3, 8, and 7
- Node 12 and its adjacent nodes: 4 and 9
- Node 13 and its adjacent nodes: 8, 4, 0, and 6
- Node 14 and its adjacent nodes: 1, 3, 7, 5, and 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[<0, (8, 13, 2)>, <0, (8, 13, 10)>, <0, (8, 2, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 5)>, <1, (3, 14, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 14)>, <2, (8, 4, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <2, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (5, 10, 14)>, <4, (13, 12, 2)>, <4, (13, 2, 14)>, <4, (12, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 10, 3)>, <6, (13, 8, 4)>, <6, (13, 4, 2)>, <6, (8, 4, 2)>, <7, (11, 14, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
