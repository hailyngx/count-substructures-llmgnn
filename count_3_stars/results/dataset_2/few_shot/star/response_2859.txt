Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and edges, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

1. Identify nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 0 has 3 connections: (0, 8), (0, 6), (0, 1)
   - Node 1 has 3 connections: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 0)
   - Node 2 has 3 connections: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 7)
   - Node 4 has 3 connections: (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 1)
   - Node 9 has 3 connections: (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3)

2. List of unique 3-stars in the graph:
   <0, (8, 6, 1)>
   <1, (4, 5, 0)>
   <2, (5, 9, 7)>
   <4, (8, 5, 1)>
   <9, (8, 2, 3)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
