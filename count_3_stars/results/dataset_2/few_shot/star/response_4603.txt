Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at each node and its connections. A 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes. Based on the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
