Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

By looking at the adjacency list provided, we can list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
