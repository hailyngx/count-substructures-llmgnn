Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 19) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (16, 2) (16, 6) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 3) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 4) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 3)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, here are all the 3-stars that can be found in the graph:
<0, (11, 1, 9)>
<1, (5, 17, 14)>
<3, (13, 4, 18)>
<4, (5, 19, 14)>
<5, (13, 1, 4)>
<6, (10, 13, 16)>
<7, (12, 15, 18)>
<15, (11, 8, 7)>
<16, (2, 6, 10)>
<19, (1, 17, 2)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
