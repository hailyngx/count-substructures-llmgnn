Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 1 forms 3-stars with (3, 14, 5) and (2, 14, 5).

2. Node 3 forms 3-stars with (1, 14, 5) and (11, 14, 10).

3. Node 5 forms 3-stars with (1, 3, 14) and (1, 2, 13).

4. Node 14 forms 3-stars with (1, 3, 10) and (1, 4, 0).

5. Node 0 forms 3-stars with (8, 2, 5) and (8, 14, 7).

6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with (10, 0, 6).

7. Node 7 forms a 3-star with (8, 0, 12).

Counting the unique 3-stars <1, (3, 14, 5)>, <1, (2, 14, 5)>, <3, (1, 14, 5)>, <3, (11, 14, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>, <5, (1, 2, 13)>, <14, (1, 3, 10)>, <14, (1, 4, 0)>, <0, (8, 2, 5)>, <0, (8, 14, 7)>, <8, (10, 0, 6)>, and <7, (8, 0, 12)>, we get 12 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
