Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To identify the 3-star structures in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (stars) and count them. Here's the process:

1. Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 4, 8, 2), so it is not a part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes (5, 9, 7, 6, 2). It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7, and 6. <1, (5, 7, 6)>
3. Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (4, 7, 0, 1). It does not form any 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 9, 7, 8). It does not form any 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 0, 6, 2). It does not form any 3-star.
6. Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (8, 1, 0, 3). It does not form any 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 4, 1, 8). It does not form any 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 2, 1). It does not form any 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 6, 0, 3). It does not form any 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes (6, 4, 3, 1). It does not form any 3-star.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <1, (5, 7, 6)>.
