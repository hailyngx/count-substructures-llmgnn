Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 3: <0, (5, 7, 3)>
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 6: <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 3: <5, (9, 4, 3)>
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>.
