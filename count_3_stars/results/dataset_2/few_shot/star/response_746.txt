Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: Found a 3-star: <4, (8, 12, 13)>
6. Node 5: Found a 3-star: <5, (9, 10, 14)>
7. Node 6: Found a 3-star: <6, (8, 11, 14)>
8. Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not a center of any 3-star.
11. Node 10: Not a center of any 3-star.
12. Node 11: Not a center of any 3-star.
13. Node 12: Not a center of any 3-star.
14. Node 13: Not a center of any 3-star.
15. Node 14: Not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <4, (8, 12, 13)>, <5, (9, 10, 14)>, and <6, (8, 11, 14)>.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
