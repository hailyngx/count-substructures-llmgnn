Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph are those nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes. Let's identify the central nodes in this graph based on the given adjacency list:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (9, 2, 8, 0).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (4, 7, 2, 5, 0).
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (9, 7, 0, 1, 6).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (9, 4, 6, 1).
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 6).
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (5, 3, 0).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (5, 9, 3).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 1, 0).

Therefore, the central nodes in this graph are 1, 6, 8, and 2. 

Let's now list the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in total.
