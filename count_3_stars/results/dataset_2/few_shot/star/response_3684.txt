Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as they are the potential central nodes of 3-stars:
   - Node 0 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 4 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 6 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 7 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 8 has 1 neighbor
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 10 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 11 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 12 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 13 has 5 neighbors
   - Node 14 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 15 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 16 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 17 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 18 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 19 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 20 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 21 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 22 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 23 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 24 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 25 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 26 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 27 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 28 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 29 has 4 neighbors

2. From the given edges, we can identify the existing 3-stars based on the central node and its adjacent nodes. Let's list them:

<5, (3, 9, 27)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<27, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<10, (17, 20, 26)>
<17, (10, 11, 18)>
<2, (27, 3, 28)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<18, (17, 20, 29)>
<7, (12, 19, 24)>
<12, (7, 24, 25)>
<13, (0, 1, 15)>
<15, (13, 14, 18)>
<16, (1, 13, 16)>
<1, (13, 11, 16)>
<11, (1, 17, 11)>
<20, (10, 18, 23)>
<21, (5, 8, 29)>
<22, (19, 24, 25)>
<26, (10, 29, 26)>
<29, (18, 21, 25)>

In this graph, there are 22 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
