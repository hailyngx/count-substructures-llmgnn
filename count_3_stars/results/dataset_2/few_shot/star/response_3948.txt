Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 12, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, 6, 13, 5, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 12, 10, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, 13, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 14, 10, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 5, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 7, 9, 4, 12, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 4, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 5

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 2)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 12)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (8, 7, 9)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (1, 0, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
