Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph and output the result in brackets:
[10]
