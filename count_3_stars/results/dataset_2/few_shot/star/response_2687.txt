Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 3, 8)>
2. <0, (6, 2, 7)>
3. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
4. <2, (6, 5, 0)>
5. <2, (6, 4, 0)>
6. <4, (3, 8, 5)>
7. <5, (6, 1, 4)>
8. <6, (9, 5, 8)>
9. <8, (9, 6, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [9].
