Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7)

Response:
Let's go step by step in identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. There are 15 nodes in total, and we need to check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

2. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

3. Let's list the unique 3-stars we find:
   - <0, (14, 12, 1)>
   - <2, (7, 8, 11)>
   - <3, (5, 12, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 9, 4)>
   - <10, (1, 11, 4)>

4. Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
