Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.
- Node 5 has adjacent nodes: 9, 12, 1, 3, 10, and 14
- Node 9 has adjacent nodes: 5, 6, and 3
- Node 4 has adjacent nodes: 8, 13, and 1
- Node 7 has adjacent nodes: 11, 3, 6, and 2
- Node 6 has adjacent nodes: 9, 7, 14, 11, 8, and 13
- Node 8 has adjacent nodes: 4, 6, 14, 0, and 1
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes: 8, 14, 11, and 1
- Node 2 has adjacent nodes: 7 and 12
- Node 3 has adjacent nodes: 5, 9, 7, and 12
- Node 1 has adjacent nodes: 5, 4, 8, and 0
- Node 13 has adjacent nodes: 4, 6, 12, and 10
- Node 10 has adjacent nodes: 5 and 13
- Node 11 has adjacent nodes: 7, 6, 0, and 14
- Node 12 has adjacent nodes: 5, 2, 13, and 3
- Node 14 has adjacent nodes: 5, 6, 8, 0, and 11

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
By looking at the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 1, 3)>
- <5, (9, 12, 1)>
- <5, (9, 14, 3)>
- <5, (12, 1, 3)>
- <5, (12, 1, 10)>
- <5, (1, 8, 0)>
- <5, (1, 8, 14)>
- <5, (1, 8, 1)>
- <5, (1, 0, 14)>
- <9, (5, 6, 3)>
- <4, (8, 6, 1)>
- <7, (11, 6, 2)>
- <8, (6, 14, 0)>
- <6, (7, 11, 14)>
- <6, (14, 8, 11)>
- <0, (14, 11, 1)>
- <2, (7, 12, 3)>

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars.
- Total number of unique 3-stars found: [16]
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 12, 1)>, <5, (9, 14, 3)>, <5, (12, 1, 3)>, <5, (12, 1, 10)>, <5, (1, 8, 0)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (1, 8, 1)>, <5, (1, 0, 14)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (8, 6, 1)>, <7, (11, 6, 2)>, <8, (6, 14, 0)>, <6, (7, 11, 14)>, <6, (14, 8, 11)>, <0, (14, 11, 1)>
