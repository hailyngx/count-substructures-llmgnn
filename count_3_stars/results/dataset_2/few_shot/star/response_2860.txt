Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each central node found in step 1, identify the three connected nodes to form the 3-star pattern.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (7, 5, 11)>
<5, (4, 8, 12)>
<8, (11, 13, 1)>
<9, (10, 13, 0)>
<10, (6, 9, 11)>
<11, (4, 7, 10)>
<12, (5, 2, 9)>
<13, (8, 2, 9)>
[7]

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
