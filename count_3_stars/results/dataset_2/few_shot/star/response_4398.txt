Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly three edges coming out from it to form a 3-star pattern.

Upon analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-star patterns:

<1, (5, 14, 10)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<4, (9, 18, 6)>
<5, (9, 18, 15)>
<6, (8, 4, 0)>
<7, (17, 15, 13)>
<8, (11, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 16)>
<12, (14, 2, 16)>
<13, (3, 7, 15)>
<14, (17, 1, 12)>
<15, (5, 17, 13)>
<16, (9, 12, 19)>
<17, (14, 15, 18)>
<18, (5, 17, 11)>
<19, (16, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
