Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of four nodes where one is connected to the other three, forming a 3-star pattern. We will examine each node and its neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 4)>
<1, (2, 11, 13)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (7, 10, 14)>
<7, (6, 12, 3)>
<8, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<10, (6, 14, 9)>
<11, (1, 13, 8)>
<12, (4, 8, 9)>
<13, (1, 11, 14)>
<14, (6, 10, 13)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: 13

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
