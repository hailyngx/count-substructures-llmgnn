Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes: 
   From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes of the 3-stars can be nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

2. For each central node, find the leaves connected to it:
   - For node 0: (5, 1, 6), (5, 9, 0), (1, 0, 14), (6, 0, 13)
   - For node 1: (8, 4, 1), (8, 14, 1), (4, 1, 6)
   - For node 4: (12, 3, 4), (12, 1, 4), (3, 4, 6)
   - For node 5: (10, 11, 5), (10, 8, 5), (11, 5, 14)
   - For node 6: (10, 2, 6), (10, 0, 6), (2, 6, 13)
   - For node 7: (12, 3, 7), (12, 2, 7), (3, 7, 14)
   - For node 8: (5, 10, 8), (5, 1, 8), (10, 8, 2)
   - For node 9: (12, 3, 9), (12, 0, 9), (3, 9, 14)
   - For node 10: (6, 2, 10), (6, 5, 10), (2, 10, 12)
   - For node 11: (12, 7, 11), (12, 5, 11), (7, 11, 13)
   - For node 12: (4, 3, 12), (4, 9, 12), (3, 12, 14)
   - For node 13: (7, 2, 13), (7, 9, 13), (2, 13, 6)
   - For node 14: (3, 1, 14), (3, 5, 14), (1, 14, 0)

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (5, 9, 0)>, <0, (1, 0, 14)>, <0, (6, 0, 13)>, 
   <1, (8, 4, 1)>, <1, (8, 14, 1)>, <1, (4, 1, 6)>, 
   <4, (12, 3, 4)>, <4, (12, 1, 4)>, <4, (3, 4, 6)>, 
   <5, (10, 11, 5)>, <5, (10, 8, 5)>, <5, (11, 5, 14)>, 
   <6, (10, 2, 6)>, <6, (10, 0, 6)>, <6, (2, 6, 13)>, 
   <7, (12, 3, 7)>, <7, (12, 2, 7)>, <7, (3, 7, 14)>, 
   <8, (5, 10, 8)>, <8, (5, 1, 8)>, <8, (10, 8, 2)>, 
   <9, (12, 3, 9)>, <9, (12, 0, 9)>, <9, (3, 9, 14)>, 
   <10, (6, 2, 10)>, <10, (6, 5, 10)>, <10, (2, 10, 12)>, 
   <11, (12, 7, 11)>, <11, (12, 5, 11)>, <11, (7, 11, 13)>, 
   <12, (4, 3, 12)>, <12, (4, 9, 12)>, <12, (3, 12, 14)>, 
   <13, (7, 2, 13)>, <13, (7, 9, 13)>, <13, (2, 13, 6)>, 
   <14, (3, 1, 14)>, <14, (3, 5, 14)>, <14, (1, 14, 0)>

4. Count the total number of 3-stars: 
   There are 39 unique 3-stars.
