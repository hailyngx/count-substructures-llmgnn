Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list out all the 3-stars below:

<List of 3-stars>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (7, 0, 9)>
<9, (7, 0, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
