Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list:
  - Node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (5, 11, 14)>.
  - Node 3 is the center of the 3-star <3, (1, 0, 2)>.
  - Node 6 is the center of the 3-star <6, (8, 14, 13)>.
  - Node 7 is the center of the 3-star <7, (9, 12, 0)>.
  - Node 9 is the center of the 3-star <9, (5, 2, 10)>.
  - Node 11 is the center of the 3-star <11, (5, 1, 0)>.
  - Node 12 is the center of the 3-star <12, (10, 7, 2)>.
  - Node 13 is the center of the 3-star <13, (3, 11, 4)>.
  - Node 14 is the center of the 3-star <14, (1, 0, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
