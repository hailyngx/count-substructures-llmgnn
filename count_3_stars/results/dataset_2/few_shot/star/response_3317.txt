Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 12, 5, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 13, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 10, 11, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 14, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 12, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 0, 12, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 5, 10, 11, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 5, 11, and node 3

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 11)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 10)>
<5, (2, 13, 14)>
<8, (2, 4, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
