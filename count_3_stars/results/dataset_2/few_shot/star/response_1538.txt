Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. Node 0: (11, 14, 5), (11, 14, 6)
2. Node 1: (10, 2, 5), (10, 2, 6)
3. Node 2: (7, 8, 13), (7, 8, 1), (7, 8, 9), (7, 13, 1), (7, 13, 9), (8, 13, 1), (8, 13, 9), (13, 1, 9)
4. Node 3: No 3-stars
5. Node 4: (12, 8, 14), (12, 8, 5)
6. Node 5: No 3-stars
7. Node 6: No 3-stars
8. Node 7: (11, 10, 9)
9. Node 8: No 3-stars
10. Node 9: (7, 0, 14), (7, 2, 0), (7, 2, 14), (0, 14, 2)
11. Node 10: No 3-stars
12. Node 11: No 3-stars
13. Node 12: No 3-stars
14. Node 13: No 3-stars
15. Node 14: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.
