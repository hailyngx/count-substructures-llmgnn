Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by examining each node to check if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Nodes with exactly 3 connections are potential center nodes of 3-stars. Let's list them first:
- Node 0 has 2 connections, so it is not a center node.
- Node 2 has 4 connections, so it is not a center node.
- Node 4 has 2 connections, so it is not a center node.
- Node 5 has 2 connections, so it is not a center node.
- Node 12 has 4 connections, so it is not a center node.
- Node 13 has 3 connections, so it is a potential center node.

Next, let's check all nodes connected to node 13 to see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 8, 14, and 2 are connected to node 13. Thus, we have 3-stars <13, (8, 14, 2)> and <13, (8, 2, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<13, (8, 14, 2)> <13, (8, 2, 14)>
