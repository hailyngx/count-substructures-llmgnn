Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These central nodes will be part of the 3-stars. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 6, 7, and 14 are central nodes in this graph.

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node to identify the 3-stars. We will list them inside angle brackets <>. 

For each central node:
1. Node 6: (5, 14, 3)
2. Node 7: (0, 13, 2)
3. Node 14: (6)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<6, (5, 14, 3)>
<7, (0, 13, 2)>
<14, (6)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph [(3)].
