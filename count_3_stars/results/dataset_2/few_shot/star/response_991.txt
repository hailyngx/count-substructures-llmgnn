Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 14, 12, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 14, 1, 6, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 11, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 14, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 14, 10, 11, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 11, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 8, 14, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, 2, and node 10

Response:
Following the given information, we can identify the 3-star configurations. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<0, (2, 12, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 14)>
<0, (12, 6, 10)>
<2, (5, 0, 14)>
<2, (5, 1, 11)>
<2, (5, 6, 14)>
<2, (6, 14, 10)>
<6, (4, 0, 12)>
<6, (7, 0, 14)>
<6, (12, 0, 10)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<8, (5, 10, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
