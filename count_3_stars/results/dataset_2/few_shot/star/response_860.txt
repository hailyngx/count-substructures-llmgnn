Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If so, create a 3-star with this node as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (11, 12, 5)>
<1, (6, 18, 17)>
<2, (3, 11, 15)>
<4, (6, 10, 18)>
<8, (13, 5, 14)>
<9, (7, 12, 3)>
<13, (8, 12, 19)>
<15, (3, 11, 9)>
<16, (14, 10, 8)>
<19, (7, 14, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
