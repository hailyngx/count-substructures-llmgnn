Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that node as the center.

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (4, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 3)>
<6, (9, 0)>
<7, (3, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
