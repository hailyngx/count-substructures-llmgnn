Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. We can then list all unique 3-stars.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <9, (2, 4, 5)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 14: <3, (0, 7, 14)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 14: <7, (4, 12, 14)>
6. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 10: <2, (8, 9, 10)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 10: <6, (0, 1, 10)>
8. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 7: <12, (8, 11, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
