Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can manually identify the 3-stars by looking for the patterns mentioned in a 3-star graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (8, 5, 3)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<2, (9, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 9, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
