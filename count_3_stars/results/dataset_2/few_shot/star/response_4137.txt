Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 3, 14, 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 1, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 10, 5, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 13, 11, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 10, 13, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 8, 10, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 11, 2, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (8, 13, 7)>
<1, (8, 3, 14)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
<3, (13, 1, 14)>
<4, (7, 10, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (9, 5, 12)>
<7, (4, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 13, 11)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (4, 9, 1)>
<11, (4, 8, 10)>
<12, (6, 9, 14)>
<13, (8, 9, 3)>
<14, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
