Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6)

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-star structures:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>

Now, we need to count the total number of such unique 3-star structures in the graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
