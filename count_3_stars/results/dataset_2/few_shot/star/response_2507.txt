Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars around each node independently.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each node and then sum up the counts:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 0
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 0
- Node 20: 0
- Node 21: 0
- Node 22: 1
- Node 23: 0
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: 0
- Node 26: 2
- Node 27: 0
- Node 28: 0
- Node 29: 0

Summing up the counts, we get a total of 13 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 12, 19)>
<1, (0, 15, 17)>
<4, (16, 19, 23)>
<7, (11, 17, 18)>
<8, (13, 24, 28)>
<12, (0, 13, 25)>
<13, (8, 12, 22)>
<15, (1, 16, 24)>
<16, (4, 5, 26)>
<17, (1, 3, 7)>
<18, (7, 24, 27)>
<22, (6, 13, 2)>
<26, (16, 26, 29)>
