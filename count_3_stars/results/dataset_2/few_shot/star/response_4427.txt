Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the center node based on the nodes it is connected to. Then, we check if any of the connected nodes have exactly two other connections among themselves. If so, we have a 3-star.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars and count them:

- For node 11: <11, (14, 8, 17)>
- For node 15: <15, (14, 17, 9)>
- For node 10: <10, (9, 15, 18)>
- For node 9: <9, (6, 4, 15)>
- For node 1: <1, (14, 8, 19)>
- For node 12: <12, (6, 7, 18)>
- For node 13: <13, (10, 15, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
