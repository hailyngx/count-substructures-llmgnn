Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can identify the 3-stars by examining each node in the graph and looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Identifying the 3-stars:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes have degree 3: 
  - Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 20, and 21
  - Node 1: Connected to nodes 22, 20, 28, and 29
  - Node 2: Connected to nodes 13, 17, and 7
  - Node 6: Connected to nodes 22, 11, and 28
  - Node 8: Connected to nodes 17, 1, and 29
  - Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 24, and 14
  - Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, and 6
  - Node 15: Connected to nodes 27, and 25
  - Node 25: Connected to nodes 20, 17, and 28
  - Node 26: Connected to nodes 22, and 29
  - Node 27: Connected to nodes 15, 21, and 29

Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 20, 21)>
- <1, (22, 28, 29)>
- <2, (13, 17, 7)>
- <6, (22, 11, 28)>
- <8, (17, 1, 29)>
- <9, (5, 24, 14)>
- <15, (27, 25)>
- <25, (20, 17, 28)>
- <26, (22, 29)>
- <27, (15, 21, 29)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
