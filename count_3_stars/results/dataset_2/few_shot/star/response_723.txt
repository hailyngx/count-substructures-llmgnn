Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's first identify all the nodes that satisfy this condition.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 (neighbors: 25, 11, 28, 14, 23)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 0, 7, 19)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 20, 9, 8)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 1, 26, 18, 16)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 0, 11, 15, 29, 23)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 9, 15, 17)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 6, 17, 4)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 3, 28)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 3, 25, 6, 8)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 21)

Now, we will go through these nodes to count the number of unique 3-stars.
