Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for instances where a central node is connected to three leaf nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
