Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (10, 14, 16)>
<1, (3, 15, 9)>
<2, (11, 15, 18)>
<4, (12, 13, 7)>
<5, (3, 18, 16)>
<6, (1, 0, 14)>
<8, (7, 13, 17)>
<11, (18, 2, 5)>
<12, (4, 7, 19)>
<14, (6, 0, 16)>
<15, (1, 9, 2)>
<16, (0, 14, 19)>
<17, (8, 13, 19)>

Thus, there are a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
