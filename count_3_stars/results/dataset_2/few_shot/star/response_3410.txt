Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can find such 3-stars by checking each node's neighbors and counting the number of 3-star configurations it is part of. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 5, 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms 0 3-stars.
4. Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 8: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 8: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
6. Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.
7. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, 8: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
8. Node 7 forms 0 3-stars.
9. Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 5: <8, (1, 3, 5)>
10. Node 9 forms 0 3-stars.

Count of 3-stars = 5
