Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

By examining the adjacency list and the list of edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 9, 9)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
