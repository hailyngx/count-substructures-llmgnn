Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given adjacency list, the nodes that can act as central nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12.

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars using the provided information about the edges and connections:

- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 14.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 6, and 14.
- Node 3 cannot form a 3-star because it does not have exactly three connections.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 10.
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 cannot form a 3-star because it does not have exactly three connections.
- Node 11 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 7.
- Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 14.

Hence, the unique 3-stars identified are:
<0, (1, 8, 14)>, <2, (13, 6, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 10)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <11, (1, 10, 7)>, <12, (8, 11, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
