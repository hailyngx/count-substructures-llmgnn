Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with three edges connected to them are: 4, 1, 3, 5, and 6.

### For node 4:
- <4, (7, 9, 5)>
  
### For node 1:
- <1, (7, 3, 6)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <1, (7, 3, 8)>

### For node 3:
- <3, (4, 7, 1)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 5)>
- <3, (7, 1, 6)>
- <3, (7, 1, 2)>
- <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>

### For node 5:
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 3)>
- <5, (7, 3, 8)>

### For node 6:
- <6, (4, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
