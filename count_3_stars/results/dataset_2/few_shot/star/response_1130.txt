Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Based on the adjacency list and the edges provided, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
- <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- <0, (9, 8, 3)>
- <0, (4, 7, 3)>

2. For Node 1:
- No 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

3. For Node 2:
- No 3-stars as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.

4. For Node 3:
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 0, 6)>
- <3, (4, 7, 1)>

5. For Node 4:
- <4, (8, 0, 7)>

6. For Node 5:
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <5, (9, 8, 3)>
- <5, (2, 8, 3)>

7. For Node 6:
- No 3-stars as it is connected to only 3 other nodes.

8. For Node 7:
- <7, (0, 4, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 1)>

9. For Node 8:
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- <8, (5, 4, 0)>

10. For Node 9:
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <9, (5, 2, 8)>
- <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: 14
