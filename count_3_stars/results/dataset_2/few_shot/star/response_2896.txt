Node 5 is connected to node 10, 14, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 12, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 10, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 14, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, 1, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 14, 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three edges coming out from it, which forms a 3-star pattern with that node as the center. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 11, 2)>
<1, (9, 12, 14)>
<2, (6, 10, 11)>
<3, (6, 12, 14)>
<4, (6, 8, 11)>
<5, (10, 14, 0)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (12, 13, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<10, (9, 2, 5)>
<11, (4, 14, 0)>
<12, (7, 13, 1)>
<13, (12, 14, 0)>
<14, (11, 3, 1)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars identified, we have found 14 different 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
