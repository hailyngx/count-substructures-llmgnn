Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Given that each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for such configurations in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 5 is the central node with leaves 1, 3, and 8. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
2. Node 1 is the central node with leaves 5, 4, and 6. <1, (5, 4, 6)>
3. Node 3 is the central node with leaves 5, 7, and 1. <3, (5, 7, 1)>
4. Node 8 is the central node with leaves 5, 9, and 6. <8, (5, 9, 6)>
5. Node 4 is the central node with leaves 9, 7, and 1. <4, (9, 7, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of 5 unique 3-stars as shown above.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
