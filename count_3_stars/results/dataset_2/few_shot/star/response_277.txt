Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<8, (6, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the answer is [4].
