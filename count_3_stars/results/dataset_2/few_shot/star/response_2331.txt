Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes while these three other nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-star structures:
<2, (1, 7, 4)>
<4, (6, 10, 3)>
<15, (10, 16, -)>
<12, (17, 19, 0)>
<8, (9, 11, 0)>
<3, (13, 12, -)>
<10, (1, 15, 7)>
<1, (2, 10, -)>
<0, (5, 8, 12)>
<7, (6, 10, 8)>
<9, (13, 8, 14)>
<16, (15, 12, -)>
<11, (18, 17, 8)>
<17, (12, 19, 11)>
<18, (2, 11, -)>
<19, (17, 11, 12)>
<6, (7, 4, -)>
<13, (3, 9, -)>
<5, (0, -, -)>
<14, (9, 16, -)>

Therefore, there are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [20].
