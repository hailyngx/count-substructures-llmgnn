Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
