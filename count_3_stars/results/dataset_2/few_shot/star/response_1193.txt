Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them. 

Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph along with the nodes involved in each 3-star:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<5, (9, 1, 2)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<5, (3, 9, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 0)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
