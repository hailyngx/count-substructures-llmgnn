Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 14)>
<1, (9, 4, 10)>
<2, (5, 7, 12)>
<3, (10)>
<4, (7, 8, 11)>
<5, (2, 11)>
<6, (8, 13, 10)> 

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
