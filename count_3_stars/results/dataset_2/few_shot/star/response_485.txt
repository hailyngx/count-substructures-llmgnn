Response:
Upon examining the graph and the given information:
- The center of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Each of those neighbors must not be connected to each other directly.
- The neighbors of the center must be distinct.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (10, 5, 18)>
<1, (11, 17, 15)>
<2, (5, 19, 4)>
<3, (8, 18, 14)>
<4, (10, 11, 2)>
<5, (13, 2, 8)>
<8, (10, 5, 9)>
<9, (17, 8, 12)>
<10, (15, 0, 8)>
<11, (1, 4, 15)>
<13, (1, 5, 16)>
<14, (7, 16, 3)>
<15, (10, 11, 1)>
<16, (13, 6, 14)>
<17, (1, 9, 0)>
<18, (13, 0, 19)>
<19, (18, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are 17 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
