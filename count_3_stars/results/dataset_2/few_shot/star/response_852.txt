Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in the given graph. Let's identify and count them:

There are two 3-stars sharing the central node 0:
<0, (3, 5, 11)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>

There are two 3-stars with different central nodes:
<3, (0, 4, 12)>
<15, (1, 10, 14)>

There are two 3-stars sharing the central node 4:
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 2, 6)>

There are two 3-stars with different central nodes:
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>

There are two 3-stars with different central nodes:
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (12, 3, 5)>

There are two 3-stars with different central nodes:
<7, (10, 16, 18)>
<7, (6, 16, 10)>

There are two 3-stars sharing the central node 8:
<8, (5, 13, 17)>
<8, (5, 13, 18)>

There are two 3-stars with different central nodes:
<10, (15, 14, 19)>
<10, (7, 11, 15)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 12:
<12, (3, 6, 0)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 13:
<13, (17, 8, 5)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 14:
<14, (10, 15, 17)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 15:
<15, (14, 10, 1)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 16:
<16, (7, 2, 16)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 17:
<17, (14, 8, 13)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 18:
<18, (8, 7, 5)>

There is one 3-star in the graph with central node 19:
<19, (10, 11, 15)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [16]
