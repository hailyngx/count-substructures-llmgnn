Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by summing up the number of 3-stars connected to each node.

Let's start by finding the number of 3-stars connected to each node:

1. Node 0: (1, 4, 18), (1, 4, 19), and (1, 18, 19) -> <0, (1, 4, 18)>, <0, (1, 4, 19)>, <0, (1, 18, 19)>
2. Node 1: (0, 4, 17) -> <1, (0, 4, 17)>
3. Node 2: No 3-stars
4. Node 3: No 3-stars
5. Node 4: (0, 1, 17) -> <4, (0, 1, 17)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars
7. Node 6: No 3-stars
8. Node 7: No 3-stars
9. Node 8: No 3-stars
10. Node 9: No 3-stars
11. Node 10: No 3-stars
12. Node 11: No 3-stars
13. Node 12: No 3-stars
14. Node 13: No 3-stars
15. Node 14: No 3-stars
16. Node 15: No 3-stars
17. Node 16: No 3-stars
18. Node 17: No 3-stars
19. Node 18: No 3-stars
20. Node 19: No 3-stars

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (1, 4, 18)>, <0, (1, 4, 19)>, <0, (1, 18, 19)>, <1, (0, 4, 17)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
