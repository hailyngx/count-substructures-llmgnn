Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- 3-star with node 0 as the center: (0, 9, 4, 7)
- 3-star with node 1 as the center: (1, 5, 6, 2)
- 3-star with node 2 as the center: (2, 5, 6, 4)
- 3-star with node 3 as the center: (3, 4, 8, None)
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: (5, 9, 2, 1)
- 3-star with node 6 as the center: (6, 9, 1, 7)
- 3-star with node 7 as the center: (7, 5, 9, 6)
- 3-star with node 8 as the center: (8, 6, 2, 0)
- 3-star with node 9 as the center: (9, 5, 6, 7)

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (4, 8, None)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)> inside brackets [].
