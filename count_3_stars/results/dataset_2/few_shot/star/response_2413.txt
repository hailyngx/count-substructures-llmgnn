Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. Let's first identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, -)>
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>

Now we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. We can see that there are 10 unique 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [10].
