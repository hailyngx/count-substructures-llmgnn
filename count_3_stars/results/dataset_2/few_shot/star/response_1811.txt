Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

1. For node 0: <0, (5, 1, 2)>
2. For node 1: <1, (9, 0, 8)>
3. For node 2: <2, (5, 9, 6)>
4. For node 3: No 3-star as it has only 2 connecting nodes.
5. For node 4: No 3-star as it has only 2 connecting nodes.
6. For node 5: <5, (9, 6, 2)>
7. For node 6: <6, (5, 3, 8)> and <6, (7, 1, 2)>
8. For node 7: No 3-star as it has only 2 connecting nodes.
9. For node 8: No 3-star as it has only 4 connecting nodes.
10. For node 9: <9, (5, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 1, 2)>, <1, (9, 0, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 1, 2)>.
