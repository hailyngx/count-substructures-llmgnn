Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

From the adjacency list provided, we can see the 3-stars in the graph:
- <4, (0, 6, 10)>
- <7, (3, 8, 17)>
- <11, (10, 14, 18)>
- <13, (0, 2, 16)>
- <14, (1, 3, 16)>
- <16, (0, 13, 15)>
- <18, (5, 11, 19)>
- <19, (2, 3, 18)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [8].
