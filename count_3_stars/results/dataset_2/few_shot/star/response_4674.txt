Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration, i.e., a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. By looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
   <0, (6, 3, 7)>
   <1, (6, 3, 4)>
   <2, (5, 9, 4)>
   <3, (5, 1, 0)>
   <4, (5, 1, 8)>
   <5, (6, 2, 4)>
   <6, (5, 1, 7)>
   <7, (5, 6, 8)>
   <8, (9, 6, 4)>

2. By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get [9].
