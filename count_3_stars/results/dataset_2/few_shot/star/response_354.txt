Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each node, list all 3-stars that have it as the central node.

Let's start by finding the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <0, (9, 6, 2)>
2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <1, (5, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <2, (5, 7, 3)>
4. Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - None
5. Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <4, (7, 8, 3)>
6. Node 5 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <5, (9, 2, 1)>
   - <5, (9, 3, 7)>
   - <5, (9, 7, 2)>
7. Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <6, (9, 3, 8)>
   - <6, (9, 8, 7)>
8. Node 7 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <7, (5, 9, 4)>
9. Node 8 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <8, (9, 4, 6)>
10. Node 9 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 8, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>
