Response:
The 3-star in this graph will consist of a central node connected to three leaf nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <2, (9, 16, 23)>
2. <3, (7, 8, 10)>
3. <3, (7, 8, 24)>
4. <4, (1, 18, 25)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 24)>
6. <5, (1, 17, 22)>
7. <5, (1, 22, 25)>
8. <6, (11, 29, 6)>
9. <7, (3, 8, 14)>
10. <8, (3, 7, 21)>
11. <9, (2, 16, 23)>
12. <10, (3, 16, 17)>
13. <13, (19, 21, 26)>
14. <13, (19, 23, 28)>
15. <13, (19, 24, 21)>
16. <13, (19, 28, 26)>
17. <14, (5, 14, 25)>
18. <16, (10, 9, 23)>
19. <17, (10, 5, 17)>
20. <18, (4, 1, 26)>
21. <19, (13, 23, 26)>
22. <19, (13, 24, 28)>
23. <19, (13, 26, 28)>
24. <19, (13, 21, 26)>
25. <21, (13, 20, 24)>
26. <21, (13, 28, 19)>
27. <22, (5, 0, 2)>
28. <22, (5, 1, 25)>
29. <23, (9, 19, 26)>
30. <24, (1, 19, 20)>
31. <24, (1, 19, 3)>
32. <24, (1, 19, 22)>
33. <24, (1, 3, 25)>
