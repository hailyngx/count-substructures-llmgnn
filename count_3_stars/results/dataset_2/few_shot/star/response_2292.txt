Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star structure with three connected nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <0, (12, 18, 8)>  
2. <1, (26, 6, 14)>  
3. <2, (3, 20, 17)>  
4. <3, (2)>  
5. <4, (10, 20, 0)>  
6. <5, (27, 19, 7)>  
7. <6, (28, 1, 22)>  
8. <7, (27, 12, 24)>  
9. <8, (0, 11, 18)>  
10. <9, (15, 1, 20)>  
11. <10, (9, 21, 4)>  
12. <11, (15, 8, 23)>  
13. <12, (0, 7, 23)>  
14. <13, (18)>  
15. <14, (28, 1, 21)>  
16. <15, (9, 28, 11)>  
17. <16, (27, 29, 21)>  
18. <17, (2)>  
19. <18, (0, 13, 11)>  
20. <19, (26, 5, 24)>  
21. <20, (9, 11, 2)>  
22. <21, (29, 10, 16)>  
23. <22, (27, 6)>  
24. <23, (0, 12, 11)>
