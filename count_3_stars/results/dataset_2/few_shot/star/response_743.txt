Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 2, 11, 4 form a 3-star with node 11 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <11, (2, 4)>
2. Similarly, nodes 1, 8, 2 form another 3-star with node 1 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <1, (8, 2)>
3. Nodes 3, 6, 13 form a 3-star with node 3 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <3, (6, 13)>
4. Nodes 0, 7, 13 form a 3-star with node 7 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <7, (0, 13)>
5. Nodes 9, 8, 12 form a 3-star with node 9 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <9, (8, 12)>
6. Nodes 10, 11, 4 form a 3-star with node 11 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <11, (10, 4)>
7. Nodes 6, 14, 12 form a 3-star with node 6 as the center. This 3-star can be represented as <6, (14, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
