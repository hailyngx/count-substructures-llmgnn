Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star in the given graph. Since a 3-star requires the central node to be connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the potential central nodes by looking at nodes with degree 3.

Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 3: connected to 14, 10, 12
- Node 6: connected to 1, 10, 12
- Node 8: connected to 9, 7, 3
- Node 12: connected to 5, 9, 7

Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars associated with each of these potential central nodes:
- For Node 3: <3, (14, 10, 12)>
- For Node 6: <6, (1, 10, 12)>
- For Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 3)>
- For Node 12: <12, (5, 9, 7)>, <12, (3, 13, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
