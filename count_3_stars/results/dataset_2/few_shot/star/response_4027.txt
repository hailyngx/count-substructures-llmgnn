Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three nodes. These nodes will represent the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we need to identify the sets of three nodes adjacent to each center node, which will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 7, 12, 16, and 17. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these center nodes:

For node 7:
- <7, (11, 6, 1)>
- <7, (11, 6, 1)>

For node 12:
- <12, (16, 10, 2)>

For node 16:
- <16, (11, 12, 2)>

For node 17:
- <17, (10, 5, 5)>
- <17, (10, 5, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
