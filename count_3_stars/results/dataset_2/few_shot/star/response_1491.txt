Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying these unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 7)>
<3, (9, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 3)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<6, (8, 3, 0)>
<7, (8, 2, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
