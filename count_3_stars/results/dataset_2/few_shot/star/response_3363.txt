Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star. In a 3-star, one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves).

After identifying the 3-stars, we will count the unique instances of 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (10, 12, 13)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, -)>
<4, (8, 0, 6)>
<5, (8, -, -)>
<6, (4, 3, 13)>
<7, (10, 12, 9)>
<8, (10, 11, 12)>
<9, (11, 7, 14)>
<10, (8, 7, 1)>
<11, (9, 13, 8)>
<12, (11, 8, 1)>
<13, (11, 6, 14)>
<14, (12, 2, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [14]
