Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 3, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 14, 3, 11, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 14, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 11, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 9, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 12, 14, 8, 11, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 14, 8, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, 9, 2, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (14, 3, 13)>
<1, (7, 12, 13)>
<2, (7, 14, 3)>
<3, (4, 0, 2)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<5, (7, 13, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (14, 9, 10)>
<9, (12, 8, 14)>
<10, (14, 9, 6)>
<11, (9, 1, 6)>
<12, (13, 1, 9)>
<13, (12, 0, 5)>
<14, (4, 0, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[14]
