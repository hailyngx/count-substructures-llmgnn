Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 0, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
