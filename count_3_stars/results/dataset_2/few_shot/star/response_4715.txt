Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node's connections:

- Node 0: (27, 21, 13), <0, (27, 21, 13)>
- Node 1: (25, 28), <1, (25, 28, 12)>
- Node 2: (3, 17, 28), <2, (3, 17, 28)>
- Node 3: (15, 2, 12), <3, (15, 2, 12)>
- Node 4: (27, 17, 8), <4, (27, 17, 8)>
- Node 5: (9, 23, 7), <5, (9, 23, 7)>
- Node 6: (29, 13), <6, (29, 13, 0)>
- Node 7: (5, 10), <7, (5, 10, 23)>
- Node 8: (24, 16), <8, (24, 16, 4)>
- Node 9: (5, 28, 12), <9, (5, 28, 12)>
- Node 10: (17, 21, 7), <10, (17, 21, 7)>
- Node 11: <11, (12)>
- Node 12: (25, 9, 18), <12, (25, 9, 18)>
- Node 13: (28, 6, 14), <13, (28, 6, 14)>
- Node 14: (15, 27, 4), <14, (15, 27, 4)>
- Node 15: (29, 3, 14), <15, (29, 3, 14)>
- Node 16: (27, 8), <16, (27, 8, 4)>

- Node 19: (29, 23), <19, (29, 23, 19)>
- Node 20: (10, 4, 23), <20, (10, 4, 23)>
- Node 21: (10, 29), <21, (10, 29, 0)>
- Node 22: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 23: (5, 20, 26), <23, (5, 20, 26)>
- Node 24: (8, 26), <24, (8, 26, 4)>
