Response:
As we are looking for 3-star graphs, we need to find nodes that are connected in the specific pattern that represents a 3-star. In this case, a 3-star will consist of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list provided, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. As a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can scan through the adjacency list and look for nodes that satisfy this condition.
   
2. For each node, we will identify if it has exactly three neighbors and if those neighbors are not interconnected. If these conditions are met, we will consider it as a 3-star graph.

3. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
   
   <2, (0, 13, 9)>
   <13, (4, 7, 2)>
   <18, (3, 15, 9)>

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars identified and provide it in brackets:
