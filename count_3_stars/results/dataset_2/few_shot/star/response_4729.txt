Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find all possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (17, 2, 19)>  
2. <0, (17, 1, 12)>  
3. <1, (5, 7, 9)>  
4. <2, (10, 18, 15)>  
5. <3, (17, 18, 7)>  
6. <4, (9)>  
7. <5, (12, 1)>  
8. <6, (15, 16)>  
9. <7, (14, 3, 1)>  
10. <8, (19)>  
11. <9, (4, 13, 3)>  
12. <10, (15, 2)>  
13. <11, (18)>  
14. <12, (17, 5)>  
15. <13, (15, 19, 9)>  
16. <14, (7, 16)>  
17. <15, (10, 18, 13)>  
18. <16, (14, 19, 6)>  
19. <17, (3, 0, 12)>  
20. <18, (11, 2, 15)>  
21. <19, (8, 13, 16)>  

There are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [21].
