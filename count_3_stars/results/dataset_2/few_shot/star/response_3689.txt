Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each central node and its 3 neighbors. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Central node 0: (0, 8, 7, 10), (0, 8, 7, 12)
- Central node 1: (1, 12, 10, 5), (1, 12, 10, 9), (1, 12, 5, 9)
- Central node 2: No 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Central node 3: (3, 13, 11, 12)
- Central node 4: (4, 13, 12, 9), (4, 13, 12, 5), (4, 13, 9, 5)
- Central node 5: (5, 4, 11, 7), (5, 4, 11, 1), (5, 4, 7, 1)
- Central node 6: (6, 8, 11, 7), (6, 8, 11, 12), (6, 8, 7, 12), (6, 8, 12, 14)
- Central node 7: (7, 0, 6, 9), (7, 0, 6, 5), (7, 0, 9, 5)
- Central node 8: (8, 13, 0, 6)
- Central node 9: (9, 4, 7, 12), (9, 4, 7, 1), (9, 4, 12, 1), (9, 4, 12, 10), (9, 4, 1, 10)
- Central node 10: (10, 13, 0, 1), (10, 13, 0, 9), (10, 13, 1, 9), (10, 13, 9, 14)
- Central node 11: (11, 3, 6, 5)
- Central node 12: (12, 4, 3, 9), (12, 4, 3, 5), (12, 3, 9, 5), (12, 0, 6, 9), (12, 0, 6, 1), (12, 0, 9, 1)
- Central node 13: (13, 8, 4, 2), (13, 8, 4, 3), (13, 4, 2, 3), (13, 3, 2, 11), (13, 2, 11, 6)
- Central node 14: (14, 10, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
