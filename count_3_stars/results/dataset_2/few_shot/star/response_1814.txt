Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the information provided.

Here is the sequence of steps to count the number of 3-stars:
1. Identify the central node of each potential 3-star.
2. Check the number of edges that originate from the central node and connect to exactly three other nodes.
3. For each such central node, list the connected nodes that form a 3-star with it.

Let's follow the steps to count the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Central Node 0: Nodes connected to 0 but not forming a 3-star: {5, 7, 1, 12, 6}
2. Central Node 1: Nodes connected to 1 but not forming a 3-star: {5, 4, 11, 0}
3. Central Node 2: Nodes connected to 2 but not forming a 3-star: {5, 3, 11, 8, 6, 14}
4. Central Node 3: Nodes connected to 3 but not forming a 3-star: {9, 2, 12, 8}
5. Central Node 4: Nodes connected to 4 but not forming a 3-star: {9, 7, 1, 6}
6. Central Node 5: Nodes connected to 5 but not forming a 3-star: {13, 2, 1, 0, 14}
7. Central Node 6: Nodes connected to 6 but not forming a 3-star: {4, 8, 2, 0, 14}
8. Central Node 7: Nodes connected to 7 but not forming a 3-star: {4, 0, 13}
9. Central Node 8: Nodes connected to 8 but not forming a 3-star: {3, 10, 13, 2, 6}
10. Central Node 9: Nodes connected to 9 but not forming a 3-star: {4, 3}
11. Central Node 10: Nodes connected to 10 but not forming a 3-star: {11, 8}
12. Central Node 11: Nodes connected to 11 but not forming a 3-star: {1, 10, 12, 2}
13. Central Node 12: Nodes connected to 12 but not forming a 3-star: {3, 11, 0}
14. Central Node 13: Nodes connected to 13 but not forming a 3-star: {5, 7, 8, 14}
15. Central Node 14: Nodes connected to 14 but not forming a 3-star: {5, 13, 2, 6}

Based on the above analysis, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars present in the graph. Let's list them:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 11)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (8, 9, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 13, 14)>
<6, (0, 13, 14)>
<7, (0, 4, 13)>
<8, (2, 6, 13)>
<9, (3, 4, 12)>
<10, (8, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 10, 12)>
<12, (3, 10, 11)>
<13, (5, 6, 8)>
<14, (5, 6, 13)>

Therefore, there are [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
