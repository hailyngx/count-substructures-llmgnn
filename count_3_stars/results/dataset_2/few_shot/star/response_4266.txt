Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star configuration. Let's examine each node:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (8, 11, 12)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (12, 10, 13)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 11, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 8, 13)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 9, 11)>
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 10 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 11 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 12 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 13 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 14 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (8, 11, 12)>, <1, (12, 10, 13)>, <2, (8, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 11, 14)>, <7, (2, 8, 13)>, and <8, (2, 9, 11)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
