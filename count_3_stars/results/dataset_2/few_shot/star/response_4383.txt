Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by examining each node as the potential center of a 3-star and counting how many valid 3-stars can be formed around it. 

Let's analyze each node:
1. Node 0: <0, (14, 16, 15)>
2. Node 1: <1, (21, 26, 2)> and <1, (21, 8, 9)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 26, 16)> and <2, (1, 26, 20)>
4. Node 3: <3, (12, 19, 22)> 
5. Node 4: <4, (19, 23, 16)>
6. Node 5: <5, (23, 29, 5)>
7. Node 6: <6, (15, 19, 20)>
8. Node 7: <7, (12, 29, 18)>
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 21, 26)>
10. Node 9: <9, (21, 8, 9)>
11. Node 11: <11, (29, 8, 11)>
12. Node 12: <12, (7, 29, 18)>
13. Node 13: <13, (17, 24, 27)> 
14. Node 14: <14, (0, 29, 14)>
15. Node 15: <15, (0, 6, 20)> and <15, (0, 19, 22)>
16. Node 16: <16, (4, 8, 0)>
17. Node 17: <17, (13, 18, 27)>
18. Node 18: <18, (7, 12, 29)>
19. Node 19: <19, (4, 6, 15)>
20. Node 20: <20, (6, 26, 27)>
21. Node 21: <21, (1, 9, 24)>
22. Node 22: <22, (3, 19, 15)>
23. Node 23: <23, (4, 5, 29)>
24. Node 24: <24, (21, 13, 27)>
25. Node 25: No 3-star can be formed.
26. Node 26: <26, (1, 2, 20)>
27. Node 27: <27, (9, 13, 20)>
28. Node 28: No 3-star can be formed.
29. Node 29: <29, (5, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
