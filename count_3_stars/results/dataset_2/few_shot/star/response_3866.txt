Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-star configurations can be found by looking at nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Then, we can identify the leaves connected to the central node.

Nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 9, 0

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>

There are [2] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
