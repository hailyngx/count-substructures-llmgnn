Node 19 is connected to node 10, 11, 18, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 4: connected to nodes 16, 19, and 5
- Node 10: connected to nodes 1, 19, and 14

Thus, there are two 3-stars in the given graph.
