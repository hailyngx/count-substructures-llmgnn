Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (21, 20, 28)>
2. <2, (29, 0, 17)>
3. <3, (12, 9, 6)>
4. <4, (13, 21, 17)>
5. <5, (12, 11, 19)>
6. <6, (11, 3, 4)>
7. <8, (27, 23, 24)>
8. <9, (14, 28, 18)>
9. <10, (12, 23, 28)>
10. <11, (27, 19, 5)>
11. <13, (22, 4, 15)>
12. <16, (29, 27, 23)>
13. <17, (29, 26, 4)>
14. <18, (26, 9, 7)>
15. <19, (11, 15, 27)>
16. <20, (1, 23, 10)>
17. <21, (22, 1, 29)>
18. <22, (13, 28, 21)>
19. <24, (8, 14, 25)>
20. <26, (17, 18, 7)>
21. <28, (1, 9, 10)>
22. <29, (21, 2, 17)>

Finally, counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [22].
