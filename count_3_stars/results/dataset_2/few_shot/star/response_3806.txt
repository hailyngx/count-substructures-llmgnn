Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be identified by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and count the 3-star graphs.

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 21, and 2. So, <3, (15, 21, 2)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 29, and 2. So, <15, (3, 29, 2)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 13. So, <2, (3, 15, 13)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 29 is connected to nodes 15, 13, and 18. So, <29, (15, 13, 18)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 29, and 25. So, <13, (2, 29, 25)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 18, and 5. So, <21, (3, 18, 5)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 18 is connected to nodes 29, 22, and 27. So, <18, (29, 22, 27)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 27, 24, and 10. So, <7, (27, 24, 10)> is a 3-star.
9. Node 11 is connected to nodes 22, 19, and 8. So, <11, (22, 19, 8)> is a 3-star.
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 4. So, <0, (26, 25, 4)> is a 3-star.
11. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 20. So, <5, (1, 21, 20)> is a 3-star.
12. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 28, and 10. So, <6, (9, 28, 10)> is a 3-star.
13. Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 25, and 19. So, <16, (7, 25, 19)> is a 3-star.
14. Node 12 is connected to nodes 27, 17, and 1. So, <12, (27, 17, 1)> is a 3-star.
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 28, 24, and 19. So, <14, (28, 24, 19)> is a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
