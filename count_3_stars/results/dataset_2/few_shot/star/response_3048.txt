Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 10)>
<12, (9, 6, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
