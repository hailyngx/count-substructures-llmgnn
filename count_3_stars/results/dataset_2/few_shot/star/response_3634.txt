Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes with three adjacent nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 11 has 5 adjacent nodes: 16, 0, 13, 12, and 17
- Node 3 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 17, 14, and 6
- Node 6 has 4 adjacent nodes: 3, 19, 8, and 18
- Node 10 has 3 adjacent nodes: 15, 8, and 9
- Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes: 4, 12, and 14
- Node 0 has 3 adjacent nodes: 11, 15, and 18
- Node 2 has 4 adjacent nodes: 16, 7, 13, and 9
- Node 1 has 3 adjacent nodes: 3, 17, and 19
- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes: 16, 19, and 2
- Node 12 has 3 adjacent nodes: 11, 5, and 18

Thus, the potential centers of 3-stars are: 11, 3, 6, 10, 5, 0, 2, 1, 7, and 12.

Now, let's check each potential center to see if they form a 3-star:
1. Center at Node 11: <11, (16, 0, 13)>
2. Center at Node 3: <3, (1, 17, 6)>
3. Center at Node 6: <6, (3, 19, 18)>
4. Center at Node 10: <10, (15, 8, 9)>
5. Center at Node 5: <5, (4, 12, 14)>
6. Center at Node 0: <0, (11, 15, 18)>
7. Center at Node 2: <2, (16, 7, 13)>
8. Center at Node 1: <1, (3, 17, 19)>
9. Center at Node 7: <7, (16, 19, 2)>
10. Center at Node 12: <12, (11, 5, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
