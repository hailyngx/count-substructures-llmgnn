Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 13, 2, 14, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 14, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 11, 1, 10, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 13, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 12, 14, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, 13, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 14, 8, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 12, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 1, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 12, 3, 1, and node 10

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<1, (7, 13, 2)>
<4, (6, 11, 3)>
<7, (9, 5, 1)>
<13, (6, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
