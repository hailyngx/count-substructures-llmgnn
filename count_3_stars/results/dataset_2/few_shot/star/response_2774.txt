Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph described above. 

There are a total of 15 nodes, and we are given the adjacency list for each node, as well as the edges between certain nodes. 

Let's list out all the possible 3-stars based on the given information:

<0, (7, 14, 10)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 13, 12)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (13, 0, 14)>
<5, (8, 1, 3)>
<6, (13)>
<7, (3, 13, 12)>
<8, (5, 1, 13)>
<9, (2, 11, 14)>
<10, (1, 3, 0)>
<11, (9, 14)>
<12, (1, 8, 7)>
<13, (9, 8, 4)>
<14, (9, 1, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[Total number of 3-stars: 14]
