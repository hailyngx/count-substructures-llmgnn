Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars.

Starting with the unique 3-stars we found:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 14)>
<2, (1, 10, 12)>
<3, (11, 4, 14)>
<4, (2, 5, 10)>
<5, (4, 7, 14)>
<6, (1, 12, 13)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<9, (0, 7, 14)>
<10, (2, 4, 5)>
<11, (3, 7, 13)>
<12, (2, 6, 9)>
<13, (6, 7, 11)>
<14, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
