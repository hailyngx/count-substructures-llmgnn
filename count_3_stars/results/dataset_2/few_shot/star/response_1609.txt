Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the 3-stars in the graph, we are looking for nodes that form a 3-star configuration with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 10 is connected to 1, 9, and 15, forming a 3-star with Node 10 as the central node and nodes 1, 9, 15 as the leaves. <10, (1, 9, 15)>
- Similarly, Node 7 is connected to 8, 13, and 15, forming another 3-star with Node 7 as the central node and nodes 8, 13, 15 as the leaves. <7, (8, 13, 15)>
- Node 8 is connected to 7, 11, and 16, forming a 3-star with Node 8 as the central node and nodes 7, 11, 16 as the leaves. <8, (7, 11, 16)>
- Node 16 is connected to 8, 17, and 18, forming another 3-star with Node 16 as the central node and nodes 8, 17, 18 as the leaves. <16, (8, 17, 18)>
- Node 11 is connected to 8, 13, and 17, forming a 3-star with Node 11 as the central node and nodes 8, 13, 17 as the leaves. <11, (8, 13, 17)>
- Lastly, Node 18 is connected to 1, 11, and 17, forming a 3-star with Node 18 as the central node and nodes 1, 11, 17 as the leaves. <18, (1, 11, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
