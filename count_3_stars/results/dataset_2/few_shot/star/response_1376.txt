Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the 3-stars. 
Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:  

<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
