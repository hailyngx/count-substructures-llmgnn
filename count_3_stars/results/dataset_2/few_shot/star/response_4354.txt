Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars. As per the definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list all such unique 3-stars.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the edges in the graph, here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 3, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<9, (7, 5, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
