Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3
- Node 3, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 19 have degree 3.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, find the 3-star configurations
- For Node 3: (3, 15, 1, 0), (3, 15, 1, 6), (3, 15, 10, 0), (3, 15, 10, 19), (3, 1, 10, 18), (3, 0, 16, 19), (3, 6, 13, 2), (3, 12, 17, 2), (3, 12, 17, 13)
- For Node 10: (10, 15, 1, 13), (10, 15, 19, 0), (10, 1, 18, 8), (10, 13, 6, 2), (10, 13, 12, 2)
- For Node 12: (12, 3, 15, 1), (12, 3, 15, 17), (12, 3, 6, 13), (12, 17, 7, 0), (12, 17, 2, 11), (12, 17, 13, 11), (12, 2, 11, 5), (12, 13, 6, 2)
- For Node 19: (19, 15, 10, 0), (19, 15, 10, 11), (19, 15, 0, 16), (19, 15, 16, 14), (19, 10, 1, 18), (19, 10, 0, 16), (19, 10, 13, 6), (19, 0, 16, 14), (19, 16, 14, 9), (19, 11, 5, 8)

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars
- Number of unique 3-stars found is 25
