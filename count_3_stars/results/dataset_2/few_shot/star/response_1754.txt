Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Three-star with center at node 0: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. Three-star with center at node 1: <1, (6, 3, 8)>
3. Three-star with center at node 2: <2, (5, 7, 4)>
4. Three-star with center at node 3: <3, (1, 0, 4)>
5. Three-star with center at node 4: <4, (6, 0, 2)>
6. Three-star with center at node 5: <5, (9, 7, 2)>
7. Three-star with center at node 6: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
8. Three-star with center at node 7: <7, (5, 9, 2)>
9. Three-star with center at node 8: <8, (6, 1, 0)>
10. Three-star with center at node 9: <9, (5, 6, 1)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
