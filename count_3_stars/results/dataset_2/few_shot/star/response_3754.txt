Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<1, (7, 27, 28)>
<2, (8, 10, 11)>
<3, (2, 18, 23)>
<4, (14, 7, 29)>
<5, (23, 10, 18)>
<6, (13, 6, 0)>
<9, (1, 12, 27)>
<9, (7, 27, 28)>
<10, (8, 26, 28)>
<11, (8, 14, 29)>
<12, (9, 27, 28)>
<15, (11, 15, 29)>
<16, (0, 16, 24)>
<18, (6, 18, 29)>
<20, (20, 25, 28)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
