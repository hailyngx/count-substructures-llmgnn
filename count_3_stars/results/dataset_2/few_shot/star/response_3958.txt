Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's first list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (2, 10, 12)>
<3, (2, 9, 12)>
<3, (9, 10, 12)>
<9, (3, 15, 17)>
<9, (3, 4, 17)>
<9, (4, 15, 17)>
<9, (4, 15, 19)>
<9, (15, 17, 19)>
<4, (9, 13, 17)>
<4, (9, 13, 19)>
<4, (13, 17, 19)>
<15, (9, 17, 18)>
<15, (9, 17, 19)>
<15, (9, 18, 19)>
<17, (9, 13, 15)>
<17, (9, 13, 19)>
<17, (13, 15, 19)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
