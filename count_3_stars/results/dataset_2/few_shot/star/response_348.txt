Response:
The first step is to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. Then, we need to check if there are exactly three nodes connected to the central node in a star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<13, (22, 21, 18)>
<14, (17, 28, 9)>
<17, (14, 29, 28)>
<18, (13, 4, 25)>
<21, (13, 6, 16)>
<22, (13, 26, 27)>
