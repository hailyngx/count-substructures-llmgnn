Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 5, 0, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences of nodes that are connected in a 3-star configuration. A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars and count them.

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph, which are:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<2, (9, 5, 3)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (6, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
