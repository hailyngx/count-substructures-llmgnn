Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected in a way that forms a 3-star structure:
   - For each node, find the nodes it is connected to, and check if a 3-star can be formed.
   
   - Nodes forming a 3-star: 
     - Node 0: (3, 15, 23), (6)
     - Node 4: (8, 24, 14), (21)
     - Node 8: (2, 10), (20, 21)
     - Node 9: (29, 25, 21), (3, 7)
     - Node 10: (27, 2), (26), (18)
     - Node 14: (4, 6), (15)
     - Node 16: (27, 24), (18)
     - Node 21: (4, 8, 9), (23)
     - Node 25: (28, 9, 22), (15)
     
2. Count the unique 3-stars identified from the above analysis: 
   - <0, (3, 15, 23)>
   - <4, (8, 24, 14)>
   - <8, (2, 10), (20, 21)>
   - <9, (29, 25, 21), (3, 7)>
   - <10, (27, 2), (26), (18)>
   - <14, (4, 6), (15)>
   - <16, (27, 24), (18)>
   - <21, (4, 8, 9), (23)>
   - <25, (28, 9, 22), (15)>
   
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
