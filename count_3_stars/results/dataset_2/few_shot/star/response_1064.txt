Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in this graph step by step:

1. We can see that the central node of the 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors. This condition eliminates nodes with less than or more than 3 neighbors. 
   Nodes fulfilling this condition: 2, 5, 7, 8

2. For each of the nodes found in step 1, we will consider the possible 3-stars they can form. We will identify the neighbors of the central node and check if they have an edge between them. 
   
   a. For node 2:
      - (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) ✅
      <2, (8, 1, 7)>
   
   b. For node 5:
      - (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) ✅
      <5, (13, 17, 3)>
   
   c. For node 7:
      - (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) ✅
      <7, (2, 17, 9)>
   
   d. For node 8:
      - (8, 2) (8, 15) ❌ (no 3rd neighbor connected to both of the other leaves)

3. Final count of 3-stars: [3]
   Unique 3-stars:
   <2, (8, 1, 7)>
   <5, (13, 17, 3)>
   <7, (2, 17, 9)>
