Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three nodes, as these nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 23, 10, and 0)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4, 21, and 23)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 12, 17, and 16)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 11, 22, and 12)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 25, 0, and 13)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 16, 5, and 28)
- Node 20 (connected to nodes 22, 6, and 28)

Next, we need to check if these nodes and their connected nodes form 3-stars. Let's go through each potential center node.

For Node 1:
- Nodes 23 and 10 are connected to Node 1, but Node 0 is not connected to Node 1, so Node 1 cannot form a 3-star.

For Node 7:
- Nodes 4, 21, and 23 are connected to Node 7, forming a 3-star. 
<7, (4, 21, 23)>

For Node 8:
- Nodes 12 and 17 are connected to Node 8, but Node 16 is not connected to Node 8, so Node 8 cannot form a 3-star.

For Node 9:
- Nodes 11 and 22 are connected to Node 9, but Node 12 is not connected to Node 9, so Node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

For Node 14:
- Node 25 is connected to Node 14, but Nodes 0 and 13 are not connected to Node 14, so Node 14 cannot form a 3-star.

For Node 15:
- Nodes 16 and 5 are connected to Node 15, but Node 28 is not directly connected to Node 15, so Node 15 cannot form a 3-star.

For Node 20:
- Nodes 22, 6, and 28 are connected to Node 20, forming a 3-star.
<20, (22, 6, 28)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
