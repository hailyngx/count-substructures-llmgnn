Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go through each node:

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 21, 2, 25.
  <1, (21, 2, 25)>

- Node 14: Connected to nodes 17, 9, 27.
  <14, (17, 9, 27)>

- Node 17: Connected to nodes 14, 10, 28.
  <17, (14, 10, 28)>

- Node 18: Connected to nodes 4, 26, 8.
  <18, (4, 26, 8)>

- Node 26: Connected to nodes 18, 22, 24.
  <26, (18, 22, 24)>

So, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
