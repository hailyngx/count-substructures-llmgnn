Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

To find a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's go through each node's adjacency list to identify the 3-stars:

1. From Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes)
2. From Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes)
3. From Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 2 is connected to 1 node)
4. From Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes)
5. From Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes)
6. From Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes)
7. From Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes)
8. From Node 7: 1 possible 3-star: <7, (11, 10, 25)>
9. From Node 8: 1 possible 3-star: <8, (11, 28, 26)> and <8, (11, 29, 26)>
10. From Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes)
11. From Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 10 is connected to 3 nodes)
12. From Node 11: 1 possible 3-star: <11, (16, 24, 7)>
13. From Node 12: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 12 is connected to 3 nodes)
14. From Node 13: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 13 is connected to 1 node)
15. From Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 14 is connected to 3 nodes)
16. From Node 15: 1 possible 3-star: <15, (0, 23, 24)>
17. From Node 16: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 16 is connected to 2 nodes)
18. From Node 17: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 17 is connected to 3 nodes)
19. From Node 18: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 18 is connected to 3 nodes)
20. From Node 19: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 19 is connected to 2 nodes)
21. From Node 20: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 20 is connected to 2 nodes)
22. From Node 21: 1 possible 3-star: <21, (16, 25, 3)>
23. From Node 22: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 22 is connected to 1 node)
24. From Node 23: 1 possible 3-star: <23, (18, 10, 29)>
25. From Node 24: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 24 is connected to 3 nodes)
26. From Node 25: 1 possible 3-star: <25, (7, 8, 26)>
27. From Node 26: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 26 is connected to 3 nodes)
28. From Node 27: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 27 is connected to 4 nodes)
29. From Node 28: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 28 is connected to 2 nodes)
30. From Node 29: No 3-stars can be formed. (Node 29 is connected to 4 nodes)

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<7, (11, 10, 25)>, <8, (11, 28, 26)>, <8, (11, 29, 26)>, <15, (0, 23, 24)>, <21, (16, 25, 3)>, <23, (18, 10, 29)>, <25, (7, 8, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
