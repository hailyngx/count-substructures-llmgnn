Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we find the following 3-star structures:
<0, (3, 2, 25)>
<1, (5, 9, 17)>
<2, (23, 22, 10)>
<3, (17, 11, 0)>
<4, (16, 21, 29)>
<5, (9, 12, 18)>
<6, (24)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<8, (29, 15, 8)>
<9, (5, 15, 1)>
<10, (2, 22, 24)>
<11, (5, 7, 23)>
<12, (5, 13, 28)>
<13, (12, 25, 27)>
<14, (7, 27, 1)>
<15, (9, 8, 25)>
<16, (4, 1, 21)>
<17, (1)>
<18, (5, 26, 28)>
<19, (26)>
<20, (21)>
<21, (4, 26, 20)>
<22, (2, 10, 25)>
<23, (11)>
<24, (6, 10)>
<25, (13, 22, 0)>

Count the total number of 3-star structures: [26]
