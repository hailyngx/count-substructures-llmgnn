Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique arrangement of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by looking at each node and determining if it forms a 3-star structure.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (11, 10, 14)>
<11, (6, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<5, (8, 4, 13)>
<10, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (10, 11, 14)>
<7, (1, 8, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
