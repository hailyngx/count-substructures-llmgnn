Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
2. For each of these nodes, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.
3. Output the count of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 3, 5

Now, let's check if these nodes form 3-stars with their neighbors:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has neighbors 9, 14, forming the 3-star <3, (9, 14)>
Total 3-stars for node 3: <3, (9, 14)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 6, forming the 3-star <5, (1, 6)>
Total 3-stars for node 5: <5, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
