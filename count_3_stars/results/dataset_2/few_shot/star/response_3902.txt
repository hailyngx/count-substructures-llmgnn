Response:
Initially, we can find all 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The node connections that form 3-stars are:
- Node 0 forms two 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 8, and node 11, 12.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 8, and 7.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 14.
- Node 13 forms two 3-stars with nodes 5, 6, 8 and nodes 12, 11, 14.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 11, 12)>
<5, (13, 8, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<13, (5, 6, 8)>
<13, (12, 11, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 6 in total. Hence, the final answer is [6].
