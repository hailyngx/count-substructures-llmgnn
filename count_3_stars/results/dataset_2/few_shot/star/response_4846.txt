Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 13, 2, 14, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 13, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 12, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 4, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 11, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 11, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 14, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 10, 6, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 13, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 12, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (5, 12, 7)>
<8, (11, 5, 7)>
<1, (10, 9, 12)>
<6, (11, 14, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
