Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

The nodes with three neighbors are: 
- Node 1: neighbors 4, 7, 16
- Node 4: neighbors 7, 1, 15
- Node 6: neighbors 5, 15, 18
- Node 7: neighbors 9, 4, 1
- Node 12: neighbors 11, 17, 18
- Node 13: neighbors 9, 6, 3
- Node 15: neighbors 4, 6, 2
- Node 17: neighbors 5, 11, 19
- Node 19: neighbors 3, 8, 17

Let's count the 3-stars by analyzing the connections between these nodes:

1. <1, (4, 7, 16)>
2. <4, (7, 1, 15)>
3. <6, (5, 15, 18)>
4. <7, (9, 4, 1)>
5. <12, (11, 17, 18)>
6. <13, (9, 6, 3)>
7. <15, (4, 6, 2)>
8. <17, (5, 11, 19)>
9. <19, (3, 8, 17)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
