Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 12, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 11, 0, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 10, 0, 5, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 12, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 5, 12, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 11, 7, 13, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 12, 3, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 9, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors: 4, 8, 12)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 10, 11, 14)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 7, 10, 13)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2, 8, 11)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 2, 6, 14)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 12)>
<1, (10, 11, 14)>
<3, (7, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 8, 11)>
<9, (2, 6, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
