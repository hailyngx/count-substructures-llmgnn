Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (18, 12, 13)>
<6, (17, 16, 8)>
<7, (17, 4, 19)>
<8, (11, 12, 6)>
<13, (5, 12, 15)>
<15, (5, 13, 9)>
<16, (14, 1, 8)>
<17, (14, 6, 19)>
<19, (17, 7, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
