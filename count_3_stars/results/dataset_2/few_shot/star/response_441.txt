Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all possible 3-stars configurations. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will check each node in the graph to see if it is the central node of a 3-star. 

Based on the given graph, the count of 3-stars is as follows:
- Node 0: 2 3-stars
    - <0, (4, 7, 3)>
    - <0, (4, 7, 6)>
- Node 1: 2 3-stars
    - <1, (5, 9, 2)>
    - <1, (5, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: 2 3-stars
    - <2, (9, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 3: 2 3-stars
    - <3, (5, 2, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 0, 8)>
- Node 4: 2 3-stars
    - <4, (5, 7, 0)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 5: 2 3-stars
    - <5, (8, 1, 3)>
    - <5, (8, 4, 3)>
- Node 6: 2 3-stars
    - <6, (7, 2, 0)>
    - <6, (7, 2, 1)>
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
    - <7, (9, 4, 0)>
    - <7, (9, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: 2 3-stars
    - <8, (5, 2, 3)>
    - <8, (5, 3, 2)>
- Node 9: 2 3-stars
    - <9, (2, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
