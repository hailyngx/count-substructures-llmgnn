Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 12, 6, 3, and node 10
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 13, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 12, 6, 11, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 10, 3, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 6, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 2, 11, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

We have a 3-star for each node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them all:

<0, (9, 6, 10)>
<1, (9, 2, 14)>
<2, (8, 1, 13)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<4, (5, 8, 14)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (11, 14, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<10, (5, 6, 13)>
<11, (7, 6, 13)>
<12, (0, 3)>
<13, (2, 11, 10)>
<14, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
