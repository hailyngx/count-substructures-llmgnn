Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 4 has three connections with nodes 5, 6, and 2. Therefore, <4, (5, 6, 2)> is a 3-star.
   
2. Node 6 has three connections with nodes 5, 7, and 8. Therefore, <6, (5, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 0 has three connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8. Therefore, <0, (1, 3, 8)> is a 3-star.

4. Node 8 has three connections with nodes 1, 3, and 6. Therefore, <8, (1, 3, 6)> is a 3-star.

Thus, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
