Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 11, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 14, 5, 13, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 14, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 10, 2, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, 11, 10, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 7, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 11, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 14: <1, (2, 5, 14)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 14: <4, (8, 10, 14)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 11: <7, (2, 5, 11)>
4. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 13: <11, (0, 7, 13)>
5. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <13, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
