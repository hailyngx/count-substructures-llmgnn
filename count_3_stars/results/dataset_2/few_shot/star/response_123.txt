Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 14, 13, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 13, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 14, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 12, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 11, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 12, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 13, 6, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 11, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, 8, 0, and node 9

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<10, (7, 2, 14)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
