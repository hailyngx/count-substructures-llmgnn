Response:
Looking at the given graph, a 3-star (star graph) consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we have 10 nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the given information.

In the given edges, we identify the connections between nodes. The adjacency list provides a clearer view of how each node is connected to others. 

Let's find the 3-star structures. We can ignore the direction of the edges since the definition of a 3-star doesn't depend on edge direction. A 3-star consists of four nodes connected in a specific way.

Nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 5
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 0
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 2
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 2

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (9, 3, 2)>
- <3, (6, 9, 1)>
- <7, (6, 9, 1)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 2)>
- <5, (1, 8, 2)>

There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
