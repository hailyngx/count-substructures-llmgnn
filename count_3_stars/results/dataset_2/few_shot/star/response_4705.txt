Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <3, (15, 17, 6)>
2. <3, (15, 17, 9)>
3. <15, (3, 18, 5)>
4. <6, (3, 5, 16)>
5. <9, (3, 4, 1)>
6. <5, (6, 13, 11)>
7. <18, (15, 4, 0)>
8. <13, (6, 5, 11)>
9. <14, (7, 12, 8)>
10. <16, (6, 1, 7)>
11. <12, (14, 0, 2)>
12. <11, (13, 2, 7)>
13. <7, (16, 11, 19)>
14. <0, (5, 18, 12)>
15. <4, (9, 18, 10)>
16. <17, (3, 19, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [16].
