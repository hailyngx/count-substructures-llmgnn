Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency information, we will search for 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by checking each node one by one to see if there are any 3-stars involving it.
We will denote the presence of a 3-star by using the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

1. Starting with Node 0: 
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 19, 10, and 9.
    - Since Node 0 has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star:
        <0, (19, 10, 9)>

2. Moving to Node 1: 
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 13.
    - Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

3. Checking Node 2: 
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 3, 13, and 17.
    - Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

4. Exploring Node 3: 
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 4.
    - Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

5. Investigating Node 4: 
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
    - Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

6. Examining Node 5: 
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 1, and 17.
    - Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

7. Checking Node 6: 
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 15, 8, and 12.
    - Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

8. Moving to Node 7: 
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 19, 14, and 17.
    - Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

9. Investigating Node 8: 
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 10, 17, and 6.
    - Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

10. Exploring Node 9: 
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 18 and 0.
    - Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

11. Checking Node 10: 
    - Node 10 is connected to nodes 8 and 0.
    - Node 10 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

12. Investigating Node 11: 
    - Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 5, and 12.
    - Node 11 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

13. Exploring Node 12: 
    - Node 12 is connected to nodes 11 and 6.
    - Node 12 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

14. Moving to Node 13: 
    - Node 13 is connected to nodes 2 and 1.
    - Node 13 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

15. Checking Node 14: 
    - Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 19.
    - Node 14 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

16. Investigating Node 15: 
    - Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 3, and 6.
    - Node 15 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

17. Exploring Node 16: 
    - Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 2.
    - Node 16 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

18. Moving to Node 17: 
    - Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 8, and 2.
    - Node 17 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

19. Checking Node 18: 
    - Node 18 is connected to node 9.
    - Node 18 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

20. Investigating Node 19: 
    - Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 0.
    - Node 19 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 neighbors.

There is only one 3-star in this graph: 
<0, (19, 10, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [1]
