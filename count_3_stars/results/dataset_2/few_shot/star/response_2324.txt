Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them in the format <center_node, (leaf_node_1, leaf_node_2, leaf_node_3)>, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify each node's neighbors based on the adjacency list given.
2. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - 3-star with center at node 0 and leaves at nodes 5, 9, 6: <0, (5, 9, 6)>
   - 3-star with center at node 0 and leaves at nodes 5, 2, 7: <0, (5, 2, 7)>

2. Node 1:
   - No 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

5. Node 4:
   - 3-star with center at node 4 and leaves at nodes 9, 1, 8: <4, (9, 1, 8)>
   - 3-star with center at node 4 and leaves at nodes 9, 8, 6: <4, (9, 8, 6)>

6. Node 5:
   - No 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

7. Node 6:
   - No 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

8. Node 7:
   - No 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

9. Node 8:
   - 3-star with center at node 8 and leaves at nodes 1, 3, 4: <8, (1, 3, 4)>
   - 3-star with center at node 8 and leaves at nodes 1, 4, 6: <8, (1, 4, 6)>

10. Node 9:
    - 3-star with center at node 9 and leaves at nodes 4, 2, 3: <9, (4, 2, 3)>
    - 3-star with center at node 9 and leaves at nodes 4, 3, 0: <9, (4, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, and <9, (4, 3, 0)>.
