Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These central nodes will form the center of the 3-stars.
From the adjacency list, the central nodes are: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 3. 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 18, and 13. 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 1, and 18. 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 6. 
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 4. 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 15. 
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 8, and 12. 
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 1, and 0. 

Now, for each central node, let's find the connected leaves (neighbors) and create the 3-stars.
- For Node 1: <1, (11, 17, 3)>
- For Node 2: <2, (14, 18, 13)>
- For Node 3: <3, (11, 1, 18)>
- For Node 4: <4, (17, 2, 6)>
- For Node 6: <6, (5, 7, 4)>
- For Node 8: <8, (6, 0, 15)>
- For Node 15: <15, (18, 8, 12)>
- For Node 17: <17, (14, 1, 0)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
