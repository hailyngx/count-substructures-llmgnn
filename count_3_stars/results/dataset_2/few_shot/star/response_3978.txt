Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, the 3-stars can be formed by choosing a node as the central node and the nodes it is connected to as the leaves.
  
Counting the 3-stars manually:
1. Node 0: <0, (3, 6, 11)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 8, 0)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 12)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 0, 13)>
5. Node 4: <4, (8, 14, 11)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 13)>
7. Node 6: <6, (8, 10, 0)>
8. Node 7: <7, (9, 2, 13)>
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 10, 6)>
10. Node 9: <9, (14, 10, 7)>
11. Node 10: <10, (9, 8, 6)>
12. Node 11: <11, (8, 2, 0)>
13. Node 12: <12, (9, 2, 14)>
14. Node 13: <13, (9, 5, 7)>
15. Node 14: <14, (9, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
