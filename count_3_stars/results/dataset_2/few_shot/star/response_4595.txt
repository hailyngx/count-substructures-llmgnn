Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 4, 12, 13, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 13, 6, 3, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 10, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 12, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 13, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 2, 0, 12, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 12, 7, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 10, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 0, 14, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 2, 0, and node 5
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

<0, (13, 12, 14)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<2, (13, 8, 14)>
<3, (10, 8, 2)>
<4, (12, 0, 14)>
<5, (13, 8, 2)>
<6, (11, 7, 12)>
<7, (10, 5, 6)>
<8, (13, 5, 2)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[8]
