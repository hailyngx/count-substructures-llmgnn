Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's break it down by checking each node for the presence of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed with Node 0 as the central node since it is only connected to 3 nodes and we need exactly 3 edges to form a 3-star.

2. Node 1: No 3-star can be formed with Node 1 as the central node as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

3. Node 2: No 3-star can be formed with Node 2 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

4. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed with Node 3 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

5. Node 4: No 3-star can be formed with Node 4 as the central node since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

6. Node 5: Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 1, and 15. (<5, (2, 1, 15)>)

7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed with Node 6 as the central node since it is only connected to 1 node.

8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed with Node 7 as the central node since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

9. Node 8: Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 2, and 14. (<8, (13, 2, 14)>)

10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed with Node 9 as the central node since it is only connected to 1 node.

11. Node 10: No 3-star can be formed with Node 10 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

12. Node 11: No 3-star can be formed with Node 11 as the central node since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

13. Node 12: No 3-star can be formed with Node 12 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

14. Node 13: No 3-star can be formed with Node 13 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

15. Node 14: No 3-star can be formed with Node 14 as the central node since it is only connected to 3 nodes and we need exactly 3 edges to form a 3-star.

16. Node 15: No 3-star can be formed with Node 15 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

17. Node 16: No 3-star can be formed with Node 16 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

18. Node 17: No 3-star can be formed with Node 17 as the central node since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

19. Node 18: No 3-star can be formed with Node 18 as the central node since it is connected to more or fewer than 3 nodes.

20. Node 19: No 3-star can be formed with Node 19 as the central node since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <5, (2, 1, 15)> and <8, (13, 2, 14)>.
