Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 5, 4, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 8, 0, 7, 12, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 11, 13, 7, 12, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 13, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 0, 3, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 13, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 5, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 12, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 1, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 2, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (10, 5, 4)>
<1, (11, 8, 12)>
<2, (11, 13, 7)>
<3, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (13, 5, 0)>
<5, (5, 13, 0)>
<6, (13, 14, 6)>
<7, (7, 10, 5)>
<8, (8, 12, 1)>
<9, (9, 0, 7)>
<10, (10, 11, 7)>
<11, (11, 14, 1)>
<12, (12, 8, 1)>
<13, (13, 5, 4)>
<14, (14, 11, 5)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
