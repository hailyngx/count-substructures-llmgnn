Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star structures. These are nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Nodes forming 3-star structures:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 29
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 25, 26
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 15, 23, 19
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 14, 11
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 22, 5, 6
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 11, 24
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 9, 20, 8
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 20, 8
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 0

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms the 3-star <1, (29)>
- Node 4 forms the 3-star <4, (25, 26)>
- Node 7 forms the 3-star <7, (15, 23, 19)>
- Node 12 forms the 3-star <12, (14, 11)>
- Node 13 forms the 3-star <13, (22, 5, 6)>
- Node 17 forms the 3-star <17, (11, 24)>
- Node 18 forms the 3-star <18, (9, 20, 8)>
- Node 21 forms the 3-star <21, (20, 8)>
- Node 28 forms the 3-star <28, (0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
