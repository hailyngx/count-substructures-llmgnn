Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each unique 3-star pattern, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then count these patterns to find the total number of 3-stars.

Starting with the given adjacency list and edges, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 11: <3, (7, 8, 11)>
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 14: <10, (4, 12, 14)>

Now, by counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
