Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can serve as the centers of 3-stars. A 3-star has a central node with exactly three leaves connected to it. Thus, we need to find nodes in the graph that have exactly three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 7: connected to nodes 14, 25, and 9
- Node 16: connected to nodes 4
- Node 19: connected to node 27

Next, we will determine the number of 3-stars with each of these nodes as the center:
1. 3-stars with center at Node 7:
   - <7, (14, 25, 9)>
  
2. 3-stars with center at Node 16:
   - <16, (4)>

3. 3-stars with center at Node 19:
   - <19, (27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
