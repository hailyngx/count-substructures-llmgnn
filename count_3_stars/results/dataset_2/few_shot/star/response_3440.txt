Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's begin by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. We will consider each node as the central node in turn and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<4, (5, 3, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 3, 2)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
