Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 3, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 0)>
<7, (5, 1, -)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
