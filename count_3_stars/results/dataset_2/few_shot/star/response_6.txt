Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Let's go through each node and count the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not a 3-star.
5. Node 4: Not a 3-star.
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 4)>
8. Node 7: Not a 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-star found: <<6, (5, 1, 4)>>
