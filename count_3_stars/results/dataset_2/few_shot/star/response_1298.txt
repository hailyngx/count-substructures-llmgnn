Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[7]
