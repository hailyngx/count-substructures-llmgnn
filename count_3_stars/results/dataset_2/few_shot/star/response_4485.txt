Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the graph based on the given structure.

The nodes that have exactly 3 connections are: 
- Node 1: Connected to {15, 5, 8}
- Node 16: Connected to {15, 8}
- Node 17: Connected to {15}
- Node 6: Connected to {7}

Next, let's examine each of these cases to see if they form 3-stars:

1. For Node 1:
   - <1, (15, 5, 8)>
   
2. For Node 16:
   - <16, (15, 1, 8)> (This one is the same as the previous case with a different central node.)
   
3. For Node 17:
   - <17, (15, 1, 16)> (This is a case where two 3-stars share two leaves.)

4. Node 6 doesn't form any 3-stars as it has only one connected node. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
