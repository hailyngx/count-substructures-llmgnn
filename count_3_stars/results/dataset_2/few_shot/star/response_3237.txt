Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star shape with itself as the central node. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 8, 14)>
<2, (9, 0, 12)>
<3, (9, 7, 13)>
<4, (10, 11, 13)>
<5, (10, 8, 14)>
<6, (1, 12, 0)>
<7, (11, 13, 3)>
<8, (9, 12, 5)>
<9, (8, 10, 2)>
<10, (9, 4, 5)>
<11, (7, 12, 4)>
<12, (6, 11, 2)>
<13, (4, 12, 7)>
<14, (1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
