Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
