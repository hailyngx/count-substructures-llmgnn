Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to find potential central nodes.
2. For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the potential central nodes:

- Nodes 2 and 6 are connected to 2 other nodes, so they cannot be central nodes.
- Nodes 0, 1, 10, 12, 13, and 15 are connected to 3 other nodes and could potentially be central nodes.

Now, let's check each potential central node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. For node 0:
    - (0, 7, 18) form the 3-star <0, (7, 18, 12)>.
2. For node 1:
    - (1, 3, 13) form the 3-star <1, (3, 13, 11)>.
3. For node 10:
    - (10, 11, 1) form the 3-star <10, (11, 1, 19)>.
4. For node 12:
    - (12, 5, 4) form the 3-star <12, (5, 4, 0)>.
5. For node 13:
    - (13, 11, 2) form the 3-star <13, (11, 2, 1)>.
6. For node 15:
    - (15, 9, 6) form the 3-star <15, (9, 6, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (7, 18, 12)>  
<1, (3, 13, 11)>  
<10, (11, 1, 19)>  
<12, (5, 4, 0)>  
<13, (11, 2, 1)>
