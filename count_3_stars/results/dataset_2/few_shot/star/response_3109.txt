Node 6 is connected to node 14, 10, 11, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 14, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 9, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 8, 14, 1, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 12, 14, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and identify the <center, (leaves)> pairs that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: No 3-stars.
- Node 2: No 3-stars.
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: No 3-stars.
- Node 5: No 3-stars.
- Node 6: No 3-stars.
- Node 7: No 3-stars.
- Node 8: No 3-stars.
- Node 9: No 3-stars.
- Node 10: No 3-stars.
- Node 11: No 3-stars.
- Node 12: No 3-stars.
- Node 13: No 3-stars.
- **Node 14: (14, 1, 13)**

There is only one 3-star in the given graph, which is <14, (1, 13)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is **1**.
