Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 13, 0, 14, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 14, 5, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 12, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 3, 11, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 5, 0, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 11, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 13, 1, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.  
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor.  

Step 2: Identify nodes that form 3-stars  
- Nodes 0, 2, and 6 form 3-stars.  
- Nodes 8, 12, and 14 form 3-stars.  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars  
- Total unique 3-stars: 2  

Step 4: List the unique 3-stars  
- <0, (8, 3, 5)>  
- <2, (14, 5, 11)>
