Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 13)>
<9, (5, 29, 8)>
<2, (5, 29, 11)>
<13, (5, 12, 1)>
<7, (21, 16, 15)>
<21, (7, 6, 20)>
<4, (22, 16, 20)>
<6, (21, 25, 15)>
<10, (29, 17, 0)>
<11, (2, 14, 11)>
<0, (23, 10, 14)>
<14, (11, 19, 0)>
<15, (7, 18, 6)>
<16, (7, 4, 26)>
<17, (10, 18, 0)>
<18, (17, 15, 7)>
<20, (21, 23, 4)>
<22, (26, 16, 4)>
<23, (0, 20, 4)>
<26, (22, 16, 4)>
<27, (14, 8, 1)>

By counting the unique 3-stars listed, we find that there are [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
