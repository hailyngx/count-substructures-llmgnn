Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0)

Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 1 is connected to node 6 and 7 (only 2 neighbors).
- Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and 8.
  
2. Now, we identify the 3-stars using the nodes found above:

- <3, (5, 0, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
