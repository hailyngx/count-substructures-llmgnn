Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and form a 3-star pattern. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 4: Since node 4 is only connected to node 7, it cannot be a part of any 3-star.

2. Node 0: Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 2, and 8. It forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (9, 1, 8)>.

3. Node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 0. It forms no 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

4. Node 2: Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, 8, and 0. It forms no 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

5. Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8. It forms 1 unique 3-star: <3, (9, 2, 8)>.

6. Node 5: Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, 8, and 7. It forms no 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

7. Node 6: Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, and 8. It forms no 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

8. Node 7: Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 6. It forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 6)>.

9. Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 6, 2, and 0. It forms 1 unique 3-star: <8, (5, 3, 0)>.

10. Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 1, 7, and 0. It forms 1 unique 3-star: <9, (5, 3, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, and <7, (5, 9, 6)>, in this graph.
