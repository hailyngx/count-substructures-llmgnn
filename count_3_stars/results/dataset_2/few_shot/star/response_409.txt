Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. Node 4 with edges to nodes 7, 8, 0 (3-star: <4, (7, 8, 0)>)
2. Node 7 with edges to nodes 4, 25, 16 (3-star: <7, (4, 25, 16)>)
3. Node 21 with edges to nodes 9, 3, 2 (3-star: <21, (9, 3, 2)>)
4. Node 20 with edges to nodes 17, 13, 6 (3-star: <20, (17, 13, 6)>)
5. Node 23 with edges to nodes 13, 3, 19 (3-star: <23, (13, 3, 19)>)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
