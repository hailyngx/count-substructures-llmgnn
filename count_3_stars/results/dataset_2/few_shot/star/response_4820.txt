Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star shape. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars we find in the graph:

<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<10, (4, 11, 0)>
<11, (4, 10, 5)>
<5, (7, 11, 8)>
<13, (8, 5, 1)>
<0, (10, 8, 2)>
<3, (2, 5, 0)>
<6, (11, 2, 12)>
<9, (7, 10, 13)>
<12, (5, 6)>

Counting all these unique instances, we find a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
