Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The <5, (9, 2, 8)> is a 3-star centered at node 5.

The <9, (5, 8, 0)> is a 3-star centered at node 9.

The <4, (0, 1, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 4.

The <7, (9, 3, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 7.

The <0, (5, 9, 4)> is a 3-star centered at node 0.

The <8, (5, 9, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 8.

The <1, (5, 4, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 1.

The <6, (4, 7, 8)> is a 3-star centered at node 6.

The <3, (9, 7, 8)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.

The <2, (5, 9, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 2.

So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
