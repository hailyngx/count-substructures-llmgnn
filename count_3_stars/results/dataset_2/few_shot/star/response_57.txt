Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 17, 12, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 13, 6, 0, 18, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 19, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 17, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 12, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 19, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 17, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 15, 12, and node 4
Node 11 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, 4, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 14, 1, 15, and node 18
Node 14 is connected to node 13
Node 15 is connected to node 13, 10, and node 18
Node 16 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 17 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 19
Node 18 is connected to node 13, 15, and node 1
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 17, and node 2

Response:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<5, (13, 14, 19)>
<9, (2, 12, 10)>
<2, (9, 19, 4)>
<3, (5, 17, 7)>
<10, (15, 12, 4)>
<1, (13, 6, 18)>
<6, (17, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 2, 8)>
<0, (17, 12, 1)>
<19, (5, 17, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
