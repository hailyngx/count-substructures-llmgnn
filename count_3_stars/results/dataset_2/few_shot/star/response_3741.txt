Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:  
Nodes 5, 13, 16, and 24 are all connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.

2. Check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star:  
   - For node 5: (5, 2, 23, 10)
   - For node 13: (13, 4, 20, 11)
   - For node 16: (16, 6, 24, 25)
   - For node 24: (24, 8, 16, 22)

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (2, 23, 10)>
<13, (4, 20, 11)>
<16, (6, 24, 25)>
<24, (8, 16, 22)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
