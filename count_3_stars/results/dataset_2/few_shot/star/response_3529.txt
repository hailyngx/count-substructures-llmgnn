Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 10, 4, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 12, 13, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 14, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 12, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 11, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 0, 10, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, 2, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Examining each node's connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 7, 11)>
<1, (3, 10, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 12)>
<3, (1, 11, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 14)>
<5, (6, 12, 11)>
<6, (5, 8, 11)>
<7, (11, 0, 10)>
<8, (6, 9, 12)>
<9, (8, 14, 0)>
<10, (1, 7, 12)>
<11, (6, 3, 5)>
<12, (1, 8, 5)>
<13, (2, 7, 10)>
<14, (9, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
