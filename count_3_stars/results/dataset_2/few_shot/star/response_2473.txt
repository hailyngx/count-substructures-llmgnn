Response:
Based on the given information, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <0, (10, 17, 4)>, <0, (10, 17, 12)>, <0, (17, 4, 12)>

2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <1, (14, 5, 19)>, <1, (14, 5, 12)>

3. Node 2 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

4. Node 3 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

5. Node 4 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

6. Node 5 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

7. Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <6, (10, 18, 14)>, <6, (10, 18, 5)>, <6, (14, 5, 1)>

8. Node 7 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

9. Node 8 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

10. Node 9 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

11. Node 10 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

12. Node 11 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

13. Node 12 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <12, (18, 0, 1)>

14. Node 13 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

15. Node 14 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

16. Node 15 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

17. Node 16 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

18. Node 17 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: <17, (16, 0, 7)>, <17, (16, 0, 5)>, <17, (16, 5, 7)>

19. Node 18 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

20. Node 19 forms no 3-stars as it needs to be connected to 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12], and they are: 
<0, (10, 17, 4)>, <0, (10, 17, 12)>, <0, (17, 4, 12)>, <1, (14, 5, 19)>, <1, (14, 5, 12)>, <6, (10, 18, 14)>, <6, (10, 18, 5)>, <6, (14, 5, 1)>, <12, (18, 0, 1)>, <17, (16, 0, 7)>, <17, (16, 0, 5)>, <17, (16, 5, 7)>
