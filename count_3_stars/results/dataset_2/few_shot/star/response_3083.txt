Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Given the adjacency list and the edges of the graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (9, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 6)>
3. <2, (6, 0, 3)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 6)>
5. <4, (9, 8, 0)>
6. <5, (9, 1, 3)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 3)>
8. <7, (5, 3, 1)>
9. <8, (4, 0, 9)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
