Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Node 0 forms 3-star with nodes: 
<0, (9, 14, 10)>
<0, (9, 1, 10)>
<0, (9, 1, 2)>
<0, (1, 14, 10)>
<0, (1, 14, 2)>
<0, (14, 5, 1)>
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<0, (2, 8, 6)>

Node 1 forms 3-star with nodes:
<1, (3, 2, 10)>
<1, (3, 2, 0)>

Node 2 forms 3-star with nodes:
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<2, (8, 3, 1)>
<2, (8, 3, 10)>

Node 3 forms 3-star with nodes:
<3, (1, 10, 4)>
<3, (8, 4, 10)>

Node 5 forms 3-star with nodes:
<5, (9, 7, 13)>

Node 7 forms 3-star with nodes:
<7, (9, 5, 13)>
<7, (5, 13, 12)>
<7, (5, 13, 11)>
<7, (5, 13, 6)>

Node 8 forms 3-star with nodes:
<8, (3, 1, 13)>
<8, (13, 5, 1)>
<8, (13, 5, 6)>
<8, (13, 12, 2)>
<8, (13, 11, 6)>
<8, (4, 10, 1)>

Node 9 forms 3-star with nodes:
<9, (5, 7, 13)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>

Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes:
<10, (1, 3, 4)>

Node 11 forms 3-star with nodes:
<11, (3, 13, 6)>
<11, (13, 5, 6)>

Node 13 forms 3-star with nodes:
<13, (5, 7, 8)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<13, (8, 3, 10)>
<13, (8, 3, 11)>
<13, (8, 4, 10)>

Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes:
<14, (5, 9, 7)>

So, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
