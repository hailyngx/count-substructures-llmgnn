Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 2, and 14.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 1, and 14.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 13, 19, and 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18 and 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 17.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 9, and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 17.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 10 and 13.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 1.
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 14.
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16 and 17.
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 19.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 3, and 1.
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 2, and 1.
16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 16 and 18.
17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 15, and 6.
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 5, and 18.
19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 15, and 17.
20. Node 19 is connected to nodes 3 and 12.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 10, 3)>
<1, (9, 13, 2)>
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
<1, (13, 3, 12)>
<2, (6, 12, 1)>
<3, (16, 7, 19)>
<4, (18, 9, 0)>
<6, (16, 9, 2)>
<10, (0, 8, 14)>
<13, (8, 12, 3)>
<14, (10, 2, 1)>
<15, (16, 18, 15)>
<16, (11, 15, 6)>
<17, (11, 5, 18)>
<18, (4, 9, 17)>
<19, (3, 12, 19)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
