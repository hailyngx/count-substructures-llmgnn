Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 10, 1, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 1, 14, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 3, 14, 0, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 14, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 12, 1, and node 10

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to 4, 11, 12, and 2)
- Node 3 (connected to 4, 11, and 13)
- Node 7 (connected to 9 and 2)

Step 2: For each of these nodes, find the unique 3-stars that can be formed.

For Node 0:
<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<0, (4, 11, 2)>
<0, (4, 12, 2)>

For Node 3:
<3, (4, 11, 13)>

For Node 7:
<7, (9, 2, x)> (There is only one combination as node 7 is only connected to 9 and 2)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The total number of unique 3-stars found is [4].
