Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (5, 9, 4)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 6)>
4. <3, (9, 1, 0)>
5. <4, (9, 8, 0)>
6. <5, (9, 6, 0)>
7. <6, (5, 1, 2)>
8. <7, (3, 2, 8)>
9. <8, (4, 7, 1)>
10. <9, (5, 4, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are a total of [10] 3-stars present.
