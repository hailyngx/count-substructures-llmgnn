Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure.

Based on the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (8, 5, 3)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<3, (6, 5, 11)>
<4, (8, 11, 1)>
<5, (12, 0, 3)>
<6, (10, 3, 11)>
<7, (9, 8, 10)>
<9, (14, 10, 7)>
<10, (1, 6, 2)>
<11, (6, 4, 12)>
<12, (5, 3, 11)>
<13, (9, 6, 2)>
<14, (11, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
