Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 8) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
[<1, (15, 14, 8)>, <3, (9, 18, 4)>, <7, (12, 19, 6)>, <15, (1, 11, 9)>, <14, (1, 12, 13)>, <16, (9, 6, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
