Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 13, 12, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 12, 0, 8, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 13, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 14, 11, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 12, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 10, 1, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 4

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list and the edges, we can see that the possible 3-stars are:
   - <1, (9, 8, 12)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 13)>
   - <1, (9, 2, 12)>
   - <1, (3, 7, 13)>
   - <1, (3, 13, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 12, 14)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 11)>
   - <4, (5, 14, 12)>

2. Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [5]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
