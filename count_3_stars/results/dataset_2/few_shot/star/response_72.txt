Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify such 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (8, 6, 3)>
2. <0, (8, 6, 2)>
3. <1, (10, 4, 2)>
4. <1, (4, 7, 2)>
5. <2, (0, 1, 13)>
6. <3, (10, 11, 7)>
7. <4, (8, 1, 6)>
8. <4, (8, 0, 6)>
9. <5, (6, 12, 14)>
10. <6, (5, 11, 14)>
11. <7, (8, 6, 14)>
12. <8, (10, 4, 12)>
13. <9, (1, 12, 9)>
14. <10, (8, 1, 13)>
15. <11, (3, 13, 6)>
16. <12, (5, 8, 13)>
17. <13, (10, 11, 2)>
18. <14, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
