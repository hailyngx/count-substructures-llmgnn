Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first find all possible 3-stars and then count their occurrences.

Here are the possible 3-stars:
<11, (16, 10, 14)>
<16, (11, 15, 17)>
<4, (16, 10, 13)>
<5, (3, 14, -)>
<13, (4, 8, 17)>
<7, (11, 0, -)>
<0, (7, 13, 17)>
<10, (11, 4, 18)>
<1, (9, 10, 2)>
<14, (11, 5, 6)>
<6, (14, 12, -)>
<12, (6, 1, 3)>
<15, (16, 18, -)>
<17, (16, 13, 18)>
<18, (16, 10, 17)>
<19, (10, 14, -)>

Count of 3-stars inside brackets: [16]
