Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 10, 2)>
<1, (3, 10, 0)>
<2, (3, 13, 4)>
<3, (1, 14, 13)>
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (6, 3, 12)>
<6, (9, 5, 14)>
<7, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (6, 13, 4)>
<9, (6, 10, 7)>
<10, (9, 1, 11)>
<11, (6, 10, 12)>
<12, (10, 11, 5)>
<13, (3, 8, 14)>
<14, (6, 3, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [14].
