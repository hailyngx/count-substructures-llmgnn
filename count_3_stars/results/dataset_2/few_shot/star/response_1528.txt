Response:
We need to find all 3-stars in the given graph. 
To find a 3-star, we need to identify a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to see if it can act as the center of a 3-star: 

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 25, 8, 7, and 21. Not a central node.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 25, 23, and 9. Not a central node.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 9, and 4. Forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 9, 4)>.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 25 and 6. Not a central node.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 29, and 26. Forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 29, 26)>.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 10, 19, 28, and 14. Not a central node.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 26, and 27. Forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 26, 27)>.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 18, 17, and 0. Forms a 3-star: <7, (18, 17, 0)>.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 0, and 12. Forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 0, 12)>.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 11, 2, 29, 24, and 1. Forms a 3-star: <9, (11, 2, 29)>.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 11 and 5. Not a central node.
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 16, 10, 9, and 29. Forms a 3-star: <11, (16, 10, 9)>.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 16, 20, and 8. Forms a 3-star: <12, (16, 20, 8)>.
- Node 13: Not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 5 and 15. Not a central node.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 19, 14, 24, and 28. Not a central node.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 11, 12, and 22. Forms a 3-star: <16, (11, 12, 22)>.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 20, 24, 27, and 7. Not a central node.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 22 and 7. Not a central node.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 5, 15, and 28. Not a central node.
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 25, 17, and 12. Not a central node.
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 23 and 0. Not a central node.
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 16 and 18. Not a central node.
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 1 and 21. Not a central node.
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 17, 9, 15. Not a central node.
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 20, 3, 1, 29, and 0. Not a central node.
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 6, 27, and 4. Not a central node.
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 17, 26, and 6. Not a central node.
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 5, 19, and 15. Not a central node.
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 11, 25, 9, and 4. Not a central node.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (8, 9, 4)>
<4, (2, 29, 26)>
<6, (3, 26, 27)>
<7, (18, 17, 0)>
<8, (2, 0, 12)>
<9, (11, 2, 29)>
<11, (16, 10, 9)>
<12, (16, 20, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
