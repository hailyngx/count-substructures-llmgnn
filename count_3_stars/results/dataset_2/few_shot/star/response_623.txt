Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes that fit this criteria are: 
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 10, 5, and 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 14, 13, and 12)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 7, 12, and 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 16, 2, and 13)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 4, 13, and 19)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 7, 10, and 14)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 11, 8, and 2)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 4, 3, and 14)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 3, 5, and 19)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 7, 3, and 8)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 1, 9, and 18)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 19, and 5)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 0, and 9)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 11, 1, and 15)
- Node 19 (connected to nodes 16, 13, and 6)

Now, we identify all unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (10, 5, 0)>
<3, (14, 13, 12)>
<4, (7, 12, 6)>
<5, (16, 2, 13)>
<6, (4, 13, 19)>
<8, (7, 10, 14)>
<10, (11, 8, 2)>
<12, (4, 3, 14)>
<13, (3, 5, 19)>
<14, (7, 3, 8)>
<15, (1, 9, 18)>
<16, (19, 5)>
<17, (0, 9)>
<18, (11, 1, 15)>
<19, (16, 13, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
