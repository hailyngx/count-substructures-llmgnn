The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 12, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 13, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 10, 6, 12, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 14, 10, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 10, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 11, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 7, 11, 2, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which are the potential centers of 3-star graphs:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 11, 13, 0)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 13)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (9, 12)
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors (1, 10)
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors (5, 7)

Based on the adjacency list, only nodes 3 and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's now find all the 3-star graphs with those nodes as centers:

For Node 3:
- <3, (9, 1, 13)>
- <3, (9, 2, 13)>
- <3, (9, 10, 13)>
- <3, (9, 3, 13)>
- <3, (9, 1, 3)>
- <3, (9, 2, 3)>
- <3, (9, 10, 3)>
- <3, (9, 11, 3)>
- <3, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 10, 3)>
- <3, (1, 11, 3)>
- <3, (2, 10, 3)>
- <3, (2, 11, 3)>
- <3, (10, 11, 3)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (9, 12, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
