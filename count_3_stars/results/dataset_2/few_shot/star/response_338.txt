Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
- Nodes 4 and 6 are connected to exactly one other node, so they are excluded. 
- Nodes 1, 3, and 7 are connected to exactly four other nodes, so they are excluded. 

Step 2: For each remaining node, identify the 3-stars. 
- Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)> and <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)> and <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)> and <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 5, 8)> and <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars. 
- There are 8 unique 3-stars in total.
