Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 0, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (9, 0, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
