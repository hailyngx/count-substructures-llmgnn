Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

There are 2 triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Triangle 2: <3, (0, 5, 7)>

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars that are not triangles:
- Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)> 

Total number of 3-stars: 2 (triangles) + 6 (non-triangles) = 8
Therefore, the answer is [8].
