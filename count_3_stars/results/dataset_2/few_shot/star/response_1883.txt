Response:
The central node for each 3-star will be represented by the numbers indicated before the adjacency list. 

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. <3, (1, 13, 28)>
2. <15, (23, 24, 27)>
3. <1, (7, 17, 29)>
4. <7, (1, 5, 10)>
5. <13, (3, 16, 24)>
6. <5, (7, 17, 21)>
7. <12, (10, 25, 26)>
8. <17, (0, 5, 11)>
9. <18, (0, 9, 28)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
