Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars.

Starting with Node 0, we see that it is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to Node 1, it is part of two 3-stars:
<1, (14, 2, 29)>
<1, (11, 5, 23)>

Node 2 is also part of a 3-star:
<2, (18, 5, 1)>

Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 5 is part of one 3-star:
<5, (21, 11, 2)>

Node 6 is part of one 3-star:
<6, (13, 7, 16)>

Node 7 is also part of one 3-star:
<7, (22, 21, 6)>

Node 8 is part of two 3-stars:
<8, (26, 27, 25)>
<8, (25, 28, 10)>

Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 10 participates in two 3-stars:
<10, (29, 24, 23)>
<10, (8, 6, 24)>

Node 11 is part of one 3-star:
<11, (9, 16, 1)>

Node 12 is part of one 3-star:
<12, (22, 14, 27)>

Node 13 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 14 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 15 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 16 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 17 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 18 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 19 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 20 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 21 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 22 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 23 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 24 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 25 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 26 participates in one 3-star:
<26, (15, 8, 27)>

Node 27 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 28 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 29 is not part of any 3-star.

Counting all identified unique 3-stars gives us a total of 10 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (14, 2, 29)>
<1, (11, 5, 23)>
<2, (18, 5, 1)>
<5, (21, 11, 2)>
<6, (13, 7, 16)>
<7, (22, 21, 6)>
<8, (26, 27, 25)>
<8, (25, 28, 10)>
<10, (29, 24, 23)>
<10, (8, 6, 24)>
