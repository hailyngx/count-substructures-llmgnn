Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 13, 2, 11, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 13, 14, 1, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 11, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 13, 12, 6, 3, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 12, 6, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 1, 10, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (8, 14, 1)>
<1, (13, 0, 14)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
<3, (8, 5, 10)>
<4, (12, 10, 14)>
<5, (7, 8, 13)>
<6, (7, 13, 14)>
<7, (6, 5, 13)>
<8, (5, 0, 12)>
<9, (11, 10, 9)>
<10, (4, 13, 12)>
<11, (5, 12, 6)>
<12, (4, 8, 2)>
<13, (5, 1, 10)>
<14, (4, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
