Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes connected to each other through a central node. Since the graph is undirected, we need to divide the total count by 2 to avoid double-counting. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars step by step:

1. Find the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 0: (13, 16, 12) → <0, (13, 16, 12)>
- Node 1: (17, 22, 18) → <1, (17, 22, 18)>
- Node 2: (4, 5, 12) → <2, (4, 5, 12)>
- Node 3: (6, 28, 27) → <3, (6, 28, 27)>
- Node 4: (8, 18, 25), (8, 20, 2) → <4, (8, 18, 25)>, <4, (8, 20, 2)>
- Node 5: (6, 2, 25), (6, 28, 3) → <5, (6, 2, 25)>, <5, (6, 28, 3)>
- Node 6: (5, 2, 25) → <6, (5, 2, 25)>
- Node 7: (22, 19, 24) → <7, (22, 19, 24)>
- Node 8: (4, 20, 29) → <8, (4, 20, 29)>
- Node 9: (15, 17, ...
