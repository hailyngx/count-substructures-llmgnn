Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Find the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors as these nodes can be the center of a 3-star.
    - Nodes 5, 4, 6, and 8 have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star.
    - Node 5: (5, 9, 2, 8), (5, 9, 1, 4), (5, 2, 8, 1), (5, 2, 1, 4)
    - Node 4: (4, 5, 7, 1), (4, 5, 7, 6)
    - Node 6: (6, 4, 3, 8)
    - Node 8: (8, 5, 2, 6)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
    - Total unique 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 2, 6)>
