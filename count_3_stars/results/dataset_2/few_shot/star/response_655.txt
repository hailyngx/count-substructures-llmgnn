Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of nodes where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars:

The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (11, 8, 13)>
<1, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<3, (14, 12, 13)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 13, 2)>
<6, (4, 1, 10)>
<7, (4, 11, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<9, (6, 14, 0)>
<10, (7, 11, 14)>
<11, (7, 10, 0)>
<12, (3, 13, 2)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>
<14, (7, 3, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
