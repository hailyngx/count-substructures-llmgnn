Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of times each node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 1: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 5: Connected to 4 nodes {15, 6, 4, 0}, forms one 3-star <5, (15, 6, 4)>.
- Node 6: Connected to 4 nodes {5, 1, 12, 4}, forms one 3-star <6, (5, 1, 12)>.
- Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 10: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 11: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 12: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 13: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 14: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 15: Connected to 3 nodes {16, 8, 5}, forms one 3-star <15, (16, 8, 5)>.
- Node 16: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 17: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 18: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 19: Not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<5, (15, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 1, 12)>, and <15, (16, 8, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
