Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Analyze the adjacency list of each node to find nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0: Connected to 6, 11, 12
- Node 1: Connected to 9, 10, 13
- Node 2: Connected to 6, 7, 12
- Node 3: Connected to 4, 6, 12
- Node 5: Connected to 10, 14, 0
- Node 6: Connected to 2, 10, 11
- Node 11: Connected to 0, 1, 6
- Node 12: Connected to 0, 2, 14

2. Build the list of unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (6, 11, 12)>
- <1, (9, 10, 13)>
- <2, (6, 7, 12)>
- <3, (4, 6, 12)>
- <5, (10, 14, 0)>
- <6, (2, 10, 11)>
- <11, (0, 1, 6)>
- <12, (0, 2, 14)>

3. Calculate the final count of 3-stars in the graph:
- Total number of 3-stars: 8
- Therefore, the output is [8].
