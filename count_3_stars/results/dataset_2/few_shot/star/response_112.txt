Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 2, 14, 10, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 13, 0, 5, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 11, 13, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 7, 14, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 12, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 11, and node 10

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node in the graph:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<1, (3, 14, 10)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<4, (7, 13, 0)>
<4, (7, 14, 11)>
<4, (7, 13, 3)>
<5, (4, 2, 0)>
<5, (4, 14, 11)>
<5, (4, 13, 7)>
<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 4)>
<7, (9, 3, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 0)>
<10, (1, 5, 14)>
<10, (1, 10, 8)>
<10, (1, 14, 11)>
<11, (7, 14, 4)>
<11, (7, 11, 1)>
<11, (7, 8, 1)>
<14, (4, 5, 2)>
<14, (4, 10, 1)>
<14, (4, 11, 7)>
<14, (1, 10, 5)>

Therefore, there are [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
