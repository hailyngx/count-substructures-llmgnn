Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
To form a 3-star, we look for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (11, 6, 14)>
<3, (8, 10, 2)>
<5, (18, 15, 0)>
<6, (1, 0, 19)>
<10, (8, 15, 14)>
<11, (16, 19, 17)>
<12, (4, 9, 13)>
<15, (10, 0, 5)>
<16, (11, 13, 18)>
<19, (9, 13, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
