Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and count them. 

Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 

In a 3-star graph, each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (9, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
