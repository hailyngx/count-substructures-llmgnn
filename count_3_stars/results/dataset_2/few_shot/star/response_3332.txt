Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 11.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 13.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 14.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 13.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 10.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 13.
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:

   <5, (2, 4, 11)>
   <9, (8, 10, 13)>
   <2, (1, 8, 14)>
   <3, (1, 4, 13)>
   <7, (0, 8, 10)>
   <12, (0, 6, 9)>
   <14, (2, 4, 13)>
   
3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found: [7]
