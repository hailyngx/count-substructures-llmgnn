Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
<3, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (0, 6, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
