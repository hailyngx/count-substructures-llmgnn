Response:
First, we identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. Based on the given information, the central nodes for 3-stars must have degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes).

The nodes that have degree 3 are:
- Node 0 (connected to 8, 2, 10)
- Node 3 (connected to 1, 7, 10)
- Node 4 (connected to 1, 10, 11)
- Node 11 (connected to 6, 7, 2)
- Node 14 (connected to 1, 13, 10)

Next, we identify the 3-stars by looking at each central node and its neighbors.

For Node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 10.
- <0, (8, 2, 10)>

For Node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 10.
- <3, (1, 7, 10)>

For Node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 11.
- <4, (1, 10, 11)>

For Node 11:
Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 2.
- <11, (6, 7, 2)>

For Node 14:
Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 13, and 10.
- <14, (1, 13, 10)>

Counting the number of 3-stars identified: [5]
