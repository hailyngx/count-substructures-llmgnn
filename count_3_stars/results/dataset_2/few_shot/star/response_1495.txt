Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
We can identify the 3-star structures by looking at nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the nodes that form 3-star structures. 

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 3)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 1)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 8, 2)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (8, 1, 0)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
