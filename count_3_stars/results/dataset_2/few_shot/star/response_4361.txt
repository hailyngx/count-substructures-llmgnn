Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 10, 12, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 10, 9, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 8, 13, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 11, 10, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 11, and node 14

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Count of 3-stars: [7]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 10, 12)>
<1, (3, 9, 10)>
<2, (4, 5, 13)>
<3, (4, 5, 11)>
<4, (3, 6, 11)>
<5, (6, 11, 14)>
<8, (7, 9, 12)>
