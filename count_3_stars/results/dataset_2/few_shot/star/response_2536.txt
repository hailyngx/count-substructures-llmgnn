   - Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes (28, 16, 23)
   - Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes (10, 2, 15)
   - Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 9, 25)
   - Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes (7, 13, 26)
   - Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes (7, 16, 27)
   - Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes (19, 24, 28)
   - Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 9, 29)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
