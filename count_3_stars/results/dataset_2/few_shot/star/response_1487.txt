Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Based on the given adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<8, (7, 16, 1)>
<13, (16, 3, 0)>
<10, (12, 5, 15)>
<12, (10, 16, 18)>
<16, (8, 13, 12)>
<6, (8, 19, 0)>
<4, (17, 19, 2)>
<5, (10, 11, 3)>
<7, (8, 9, 15)>
<9, (14, 7, 15)>
<15, (17, 12, 7)>
<18, (12, 15, 0)>
<14, (16, 9, 15)>
<3, (13, 4, 5)>
<2, (11, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
