Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves):
   - Node 5: (29, 1, 7)
   - Node 6: (10, 15, 8)
   - Node 8: (6, 3, 27)
   - Node 9: (14, 16, X)
   - Node 12: (0, 15, 4)
   - Node 13: (2, 11, 24)
   - Node 16: (9, 25, 24)
   - Node 24: (22, 0, 16)
   - Node 27: (8, 28, 19)
   - Node 29: (17, 5, X)

2. For each node with exactly three neighbors, identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 5: <5, (29, 1, 7)>
   - Node 6: <6, (10, 15, 8)>
   - Node 8: <8, (6, 3, 27)>
   - Node 12: <12, (0, 15, 4)>
   - Node 13: <13, (2, 11, 24)>
   - Node 16: <16, (9, 25, 24)>
   - Node 24: <24, (22, 0, 16)>
   - Node 27: <27, (8, 28, 19)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total number of unique 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
