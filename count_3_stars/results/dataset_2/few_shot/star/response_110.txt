Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Given the number of nodes and edges, the graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 0), (7, 3), (2, 6), (8, 6), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 6), (3, 8)}

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the central node for each potential 3-star.
- Looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: Check each potential 3-star configuration to see if it fits the definition of a 3-star (center node connected to three other nodes).

Potential 3-star configurations:
1. (5, 8, 1) - Not a 3-star since node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
2. (5, 1, 3) - Not a 3-star since node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
3. (5, 3, 9) - Not a 3-star since node 9 is connected to 5 nodes.
4. (9, 4, 1) - Not a 3-star since node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
5. (4, 7, 0) - Not a 3-star since node 4 is connected to 5 nodes.
6. (7, 0, 3) - Not a 3-star since node 7 is connected to 3 nodes.
7. (2, 6, 8) - Not a 3-star since node 2 is connected to 2 nodes.
8. (0, 3, 6) - This is a 3-star. Central node: 0, Leaves: 3, 6
9. (1, 6, 5) - Not a 3-star since node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
10. (3, 8, 5) - Not a 3-star since node 3 is connected to 5 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
