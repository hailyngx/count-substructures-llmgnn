Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-stars in the graph using the given information. 

Now, let's analyze the connections for each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (9, 10, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (10, 18, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (15, 13, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (16, 15, 10)>
- Node 4: <4, (16, 15, 14)>
- Node 5: <5, (11, 12, 18)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 19, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (17, 2, 18)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 12, 19)>
- Node 9: <9, (8, 0, 10)>
- Node 10: <10, (3, 0, 1)>
- Node 11: <11, (16, 5, 15)>
- Node 12: <12, (8, 19, 5)>
- Node 13: <13, (2, 14, 4)>
- Node 14: <14, (13, 6, 4)>
- Node 15: <15, (11, 3, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (11, 17, 3)>
- Node 17: <17, (16, 7, 18)>
- Node 18: <18, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 19: <19, (3, 15, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
