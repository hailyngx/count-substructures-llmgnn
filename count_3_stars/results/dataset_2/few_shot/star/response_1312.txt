Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). Let's first list all the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 1)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 7, 6)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
