Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2 forming a 3-star. (<5, (9, 6, 2)>)
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3 forming a 3-star. (<6, (5, 7, 3)>)
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1 forming a 3-star. (<2, (5, 8, 1)>)
4. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7 forming a 3-star. (<0, (5, 9, 7)>)
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1 forming a 3-star. (<4, (5, 9, 1)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
