Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (5, 4, 7)>
2. Node 2: <2, (5, 1, 8)>
3. Node 3: No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 4: No 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.
5. Node 5: No 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.
6. Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 1)>
7. Node 7: <7, (9, 4, 8)>
8. Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 2)>
9. Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
