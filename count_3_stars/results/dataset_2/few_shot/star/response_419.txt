Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can count the number of triangles each node is involved in. A node connected to exactly three other nodes forms the center of a 3-star. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, 2.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 0.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 13.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, 11.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 12, 4.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 13)>
<8, (7, 2, 11)>
<9, (3, 12, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
