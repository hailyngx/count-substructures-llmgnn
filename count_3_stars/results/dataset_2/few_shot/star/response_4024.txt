Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If a node meets the criteria, then list the 3-star.

Based on the provided information, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<4, (8, 13, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 2)>
<7, (10, 2, 0)>
<12, (1, 2, 14)>
<13, (11, 4, 9)>
<14, (8, 12, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
