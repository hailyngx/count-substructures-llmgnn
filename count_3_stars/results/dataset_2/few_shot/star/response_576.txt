Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node's neighbors and determine if there are any 3-stars centered around that node. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0:** (8, 16, 12) - <0, (8, 16, 12)>  
2. **Node 1:** (6, 19, 5) - <1, (6, 19, 5)>  
3. **Node 2:** (17, 10, 14) - <2, (17, 10, 14)>  
4. **Node 3:** (17, 10, 18) - <3, (17, 10, 18)>  
5. **Node 4:** (19, 16, 12), (19, 14, 16) - <4, (19, 16, 12)>  
6. **Node 5:** (6, 11, 5) - <5, (6, 11, 5)>  
7. **Node 6:** (1, 7, 5) - <6, (1, 7, 5)>  
8. **Node 7:** (6, 9, 15) - <7, (6, 9, 15)>  
9. **Node 8:** (0, 12, 16) - <8, (0, 12, 16)>  
10. **Node 9:** (13, 7, 16) - <9, (13, 7, 16)>  
11. **Node 10:** (15, 19, 3), (15, 2, 10) - <10, (15, 19, 3)>  
12. **Node 11:** (5, 13, 11) - <11, (5, 13, 11)>  
13. **Node 12:** (0, 8, 13), (0, 16, 4) - <12, (0, 8, 13)>  
14. **Node 13:** (12, 9, 11), (12, 13, 9) - <13, (12, 9, 11)>  
15. **Node 14:** (4, 2, 18), (4, 18, 16) - <14, (4, 2, 18)>  
16. **Node 15:** (17, 18, 3), (17, 10, 15) - <15, (17, 18, 3)>  
17. **Node 16:** (9, 0, 4) - <16, (9, 0, 4)>  
18. **Node 17:** (3, 2, 15) - <17, (3, 2, 15)>  
19. **Node 18:** (14, 3, 15) - <18, (14, 3, 15)>  
20. **Node 19:** (1, 10, 4) - <19, (1, 10, 4)>
