Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes have the following connections:

- Node 0: (6, 2, 13, 12)
- Node 1: (9, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (6, 13, 10, 0)
- Node 3: (9, 4, 13, 10)
- Node 4: (5, 7, 12, 3, 11)
- Node 5: (9, 6, 4, 7)
- Node 6: (5, 2, 12, 0)
- Node 7: (5, 4, 10, 1, 8)
- Node 8: (7, 10, 1)
- Node 9: (5, 14, 3, 1, 12)
- Node 10: (7, 2, 8, 3, 14)
- Node 11: (4, 14)
- Node 12: (9, 4, 6, 0)
- Node 13: (2, 3, 14, 0)
- Node 14: (9, 13, 10, 11)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 13, 12)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 13, 10)>
<3, (9, 4, 13)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 2, 12)>
<7, (9, 8, 10)>
<8, (7, 10, 1)>
<9, (5, 14, 1)>
<10, (7, 2, 14)>
<11, (4, 14)>
<12, (9, 4, 6)>
<13, (2, 3, 14)>
<14, (9, 10, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
