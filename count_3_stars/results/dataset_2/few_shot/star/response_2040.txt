Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph to count them. 

The 3-stars can be found by looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (16, 17, 15)>
<5, (9, 6, 19)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (16, 9, 1)>
<16, (11, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 17, 13)>
<0, (8, 10, 12)>
<18, (5, 8, 4)>
<19, (5, 18, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9].
