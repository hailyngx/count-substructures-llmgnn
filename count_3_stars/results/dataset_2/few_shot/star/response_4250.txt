Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (forming a 3-star).

Starting from each node, we can check if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes. Let's go through each node:

1. Node 0: Forms 3-star with nodes 6, 4, 7 <0, (6, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1: Does not form a 3-star
3. Node 2: Does not form a 3-star
4. Node 3: Forms 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 0 <3, (5, 6, 0)>
5. Node 4: Forms 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 6 <4, (5, 9, 6)>
6. Node 5: Does not form a 3-star
7. Node 6: Forms 3-star with nodes 3, 2, 8 <6, (3, 2, 8)>
8. Node 7: Forms 3-star with nodes 9, 1, 8 <7, (9, 1, 8)>
9. Node 8: Forms 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 6 <8, (5, 9, 6)>
10. Node 9: Does not form a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<0, (6, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>

The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
