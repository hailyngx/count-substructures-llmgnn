Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's start by identifying the 3-stars one by one.

1. From the adjacency list, Node 5 has connections to Node 6, Node 2, and Node 8. Therefore, <5, (6, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 6 is connected to Node 5, Node 9, and Node 2. So, <6, (5, 9, 2)> is another 3-star.

3. Both the 3-star patterns identified above have Node 5 or Node 6 as the center. Therefore, there are no other unique 3-star patterns in this graph.

Finally, [the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2] - since we found 2 unique 3-star patterns above.
