Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 12 is connected to node 0, 11, 2, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 11, 7, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 11)>
<0, (5, 14, 7)>
<11, (5, 3, 13)>
<7, (6, 0, 14)>
<1, (9, 14, 2)>
<6, (14, 7, 4)>
<3, (11, 7, 10)>
<12, (0, 11, 2)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<2, (12, 1, 10)>
<13, (9, 11, 7)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [12].
