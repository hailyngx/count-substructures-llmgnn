Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
