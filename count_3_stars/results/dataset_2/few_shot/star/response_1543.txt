Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (7, 15, 17)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 13)>
3. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 12)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>
5. Node 7: <7, (0, 16, 15)>, <7, (0, 15, 17)>, <7, (0, 7, 14)>
6. Node 10: <10, (8, 13, 4)>, <10, (8, 13, 9)>, <10, (8, 4, 9)>
7. Node 12: <12, (3, 4, 16)>, <12, (3, 4, 18)>
8. Node 13: <13, (1, 10, 18)>
9. Node 14: <14, (8, 5, 7)>
10. Node 16: <16, (7, 4, 18)>, <16, (7, 12, 18)>
11. Node 17: <17, (6, 9, 18)>, <17, (6, 0, 15)>, <17, (6, 0, 17)>, <17, (6, 17, 15)>
12. Node 18: <18, (13, 12, 16)>, <18, (13, 12, 17)>, <18, (13, 16, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
