Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each instance where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<3, (0, 7, 15)>
<4, (8, 7, 11)>
<8, (3, 4, 14)>
<9, (2, 3, 10)>
<10, (2, 5, 9)>
<11, (16, 17, 4)>
<12, (5, 18, 1)>
<13, (6, 14, 17)>
<14, (2, 13, 8)>
<15, (3, 4, 2)>
<16, (11, 17)>
<17, (13, 0, 11)>
<18, (6, 12, 1)>
<19, (1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
