Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars by checking which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can confirm if the connections between these nodes form a 3-star pattern.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 2, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11 and 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 14.

Now, let's check if these connections form 3-stars:
1. For Node 5: 
    - <5, (8, 12, 3)>
2. For Node 9:
    - <9, (8, 14, 0)>
3. For Node 6: 
    - <6, (10, 2, 12)>
4. For Node 4:
    - No 3-star found.
5. For Node 10:
    - No 3-star found.
6. For Node 13:
    - <13, (4, 7, 12)>
7. For Node 2:
    - <2, (8, 6, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <5, (8, 12, 3)>, <9, (8, 14, 0)>, and <13, (4, 7, 12)>.
