Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node in each potential 3-star.
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 1, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 0, 3)>
<3, (7, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 5, 2)>

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
