Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 12, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 2, 13, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 13, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 12, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 5, 6, 0, 2, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 7, 12, 13, and node 4
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 7, 1, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 14, 13, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 7, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 5, 4, 3, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 11, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three connections are as follows:
- Node 4 is connected to node 2, 13, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 8 and 0
- Node 7 is connected to node 10, 12, and 9
- Node 14 is connected to node 11 and 8

We will now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4 can form a 3-star <4, (2, 13, 9)>
2. Node 6 can form a 3-star <6, (8, 0, -)>
3. Node 7 can form a 3-star <7, (10, 12, 9)>
4. Node 14 can form a 3-star <14, (11, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
