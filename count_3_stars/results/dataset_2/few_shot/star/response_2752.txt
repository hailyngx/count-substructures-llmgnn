Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph is always connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We need to identify all the unique 3-star configurations in the given graph.

Let's go through each node and check if it acts as the center of a 3-star. 

Starting with Node 0: Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (9, 3, 7, 2), but it is not the center of any 3-star.

Moving on to Node 1: Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes (6, 3, 5, 8), but it is also not the center of any 3-star.

Next, Node 2: Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes (9, 7, 8, 0), but it does not form a 3-star as a center.

Node 3: Node 3 is connected to 5 nodes (6, 9, 1, 0, 5). It forms one 3-star: <3, (6, 9, 1)>.

Node 4: Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes (9, 7) and doesn't form a 3-star.

Node 5: Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 3, 7, 8) but doesn't form a 3-star.

Node 6: Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (9, 1, 3, 8) and forms one 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 3)>.

Node 7: Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 0, 2, 5) but doesn't form a 3-star.

Node 8: Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes (6, 1, 2, 5) and also forms one 3-star: <8, (6, 1, 5)>.

Lastly, Node 9: Node 9 is connected to 5 nodes (6, 4, 2, 3, 0) and forms one 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 2)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:

<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
