Response:
We are looking for 3-star structures in the graph. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with (13, 15, 16).
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with (4, 8, 19).
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with (13, 17, 18).
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with (13, 14, 16).
5. Node 11 forms a 3-star with (14, 19, 9).
6. Node 12 forms a 3-star with (10, 16, 19).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (13, 15, 16)>
<2, (4, 8, 19)>
<3, (13, 17, 18)>
<5, (13, 14, 16)>
<11, (14, 19, 9)>
<12, (10, 16, 19)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
