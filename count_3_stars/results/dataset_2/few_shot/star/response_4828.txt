Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-star configurations.

The total number of 3-star configurations can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that could act as the center of a 3-star.
In this case, the nodes can be potential centers if they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes are:
- Node 8
- Node 10

Let's list down the 3-star configurations for each potential center:

For Node 8:
- <8, (6, 19, 11)>
- <8, (6, 19, 12)>

For Node 10:
- <10, (4, 7, 19)>

Count of 3-star configurations: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
- <8, (6, 19, 11)>
- <8, (6, 19, 12)>
- <10, (4, 7, 19)>
