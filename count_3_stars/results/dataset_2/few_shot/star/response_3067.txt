Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 0, and node 4

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify and count the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**: Connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1. Resulting 3-star: <0, (9, 6, 1)>
2. **Node 1**: Connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0. Resulting 3-star: <1, (5, 4, 0)>
3. **Node 2**: Connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8. Resulting 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
4. **Node 3**: Connected to nodes 6, 4, and 7. Resulting 3-star: <3, (6, 4, 7)>
5. **Node 4**: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2. Resulting 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 2)>
6. **Node 5**: Connected to nodes 9, 1, and 7. Resulting 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 7)>
7. **Node 6**: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8. Resulting 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 8)>
8. **Node 7**: Connected to nodes 5, 3, and 4. Resulting 3-star: <7, (5, 3, 4)>
9. **Node 8**: Connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2. Resulting 3-star: <8, (9, 6, 2)>
10. **Node 9**: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 3. Resulting 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
