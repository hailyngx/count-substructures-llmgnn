Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's find nodes with at least three neighbors. 
Based on the given adjacency list, nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14. 

Next, let's go through each of these potential central nodes and check their connections to identify 3-stars.
- Node 0 (connected to 5, 10, 1, and 2): <0, (5, 10, 1)>
- Node 1 (connected to 6, 11, 12, and 0): <1, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 2 (connected to 5, 9, 6, and 0): <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 3 (connected to 5, 7, 14, and 13): <3, (5, 7, 14)> and <3, (5, 13, 14)>
- Node 4 (connected to 9, 12, 13, and 14): <4, (9, 12, 13)> and <4, (9, 13, 14)>
- Node 5 (connected to 9, 2, 0, 3, 7, and 14): <5, (9, 2, 0)> and <5, (9, 2, 14)>
- Node 7 (connected to 5, 9, 10, and 3): <7, (5, 9, 10)>
- Node 10 (connected to 0, 12, 8, and 7): <10, (0, 12, 8)> and <10, (0, 12, 7)>
- Node 12 (connected to 10, 4, 13, and 1): <12, (10, 4, 13)> and <12, (10, 4, 1)>
- Node 14 (connected to 5, 4, 8, 1, and 3): <14, (5, 4, 8)> and <14, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 10, 1)>
<1, (6, 11, 12)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<3, (5, 13, 14)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<4, (9, 13, 14)>
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 14)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<10, (0, 12, 8)>
<10, (0, 12, 7)>
<12, (10, 4, 13)>
<12, (10, 4, 1)>
<14, (5, 4, 8)>
<14, (5, 4, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [16].
