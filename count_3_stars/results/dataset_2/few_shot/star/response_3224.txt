Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent potential 3-stars with that node as the center.

Let's list the potential 3-stars with the format <center node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)>

<9, (26, 29, 10)>
<26, (9, 18, 21)>
<3, (10, 16, 13)>
<15, (20, 18, 2)>
<17, (1, 16, 5)>
<18, (26, 15, 22)>
<22, (14, 18, 19)>
<8, (23, 2, 19)>
<20, (15, 23, 7)>
<11, (14, 24, 27)>
<1, (17, 8, 19)>
<27, (22, 21, 11)>
<28, (8, 21, 0)>
<5, (17, 6, None)>
<6, (5, 25, 4)>
<25, (6, 13, None)>
<13, (3, 25, 10)>
<7, (20, 24, 27)>
<0, (28, 19, None)>
<4, (6, None, None)>
<10, (9, 3, 2)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars using the above list. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
