Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<0, (9, 7, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 0, 2)>
<8, (4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
