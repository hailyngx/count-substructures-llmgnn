Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 10, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 12, 11, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 7, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 14, 3, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 1, 13, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, 13, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 10

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's go through each node and its connections to find all the 3-stars:

- <0, (4, 8, 12)>
- <1, (4, 2, 10)>
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- <3, (9, 2, 8)>
- <4, (7, 0, 11)>
- <5, (8, 12, 11)>
- <6, (9, 14, 7)>
- <7, (6, 4, 13)>
- <8, (2, 5, 0)>
- <9, (6, 14, 3)>
- <10, (3, 1, 13)>
- <11, (6, 4, 5)>
- <12, (9, 0, 5)>
- <13, (7, 10, 12)>
- <14, (6, 9, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14].
