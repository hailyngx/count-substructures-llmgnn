Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the information provided. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the 3-star configurations can occur at nodes with three edges connected. 

Nodes with three edges connected:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 27, 9, 4
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 8, 18
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 8, 5
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 28, 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 22, 23
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 20, 18, 7
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 20, 6, 13
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 28, 16
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 7, 24, 14
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 29, 4, 23
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 27, 4, 19
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 26, 18, 7
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 25, 11
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 29, 17, 9
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 29, 8, 16
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 15, 19, 28
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 8, 19, 26
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 17, 23, 24

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [17]
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (27, 9, 4)>
<4, (2, 8, 18)>
<6, (1, 8, 5)>
<8, (4, 28, 6)>
<9, (2, 22, 23)>
<10, (20, 18, 7)>
<11, (20, 6, 13)>
<14, (6, 28, 16)>
<16, (7, 24, 14)>
<17, (29, 4, 23)>
<18, (27, 4, 19)>
<19, (26, 18, 7)>
<21, (25, 11)>
<23, (29, 17, 9)>
<24, (29, 8, 16)>
<26, (15, 19, 28)>
<28, (8, 19, 26)>
