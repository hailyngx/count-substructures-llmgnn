Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is the center of a 3-star, which is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (11, 1, 6)>
<1, (7, 14, 0)>
<2, (11, 9, 17)>
<3, (7, 13, 4)>
<4, (5, 19, 17)>
<5, (13, 14, 16)>
<6, (11, 19, 0)>
<7, (12, 3, 1)>
<8, (7, 18, 8)>
<9, (10, 11, 18)>
<10, (13, 9, 10)>
<11, (0, 9, 6)>
<12, (7)>
<13, (10, 5, 18)>
<14, (5, 1)>
<15, (17)>
<16, (5, 17)>
<17, (15, 4, 16)>
<18, (13, 8, 9)>
<19, (4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
