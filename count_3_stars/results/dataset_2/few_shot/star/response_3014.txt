Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 15, 11: <4, (7, 15, 11)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, 8: <7, (4, 1, 8)>
3. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 11, 16: <14, (17, 11, 16)>
4. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 10, 5: <17, (14, 10, 5)>
5. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, 18: <15, (4, 10, 18)>
6. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 15, 0: <16, (14, 15, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
