Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

1. <11, (3, 8, 1)>
2. <16, (12, 17, 1)>
3. <3, (11, 15, 13)>
4. <6, (9, 18, 8)>
5. <9, (6, 4, 2)>
6. <4, (6, 18, 2)>
7. <18, (6, 4, 8)>
8. <0, (10, 17, 5)>
9. <2, (9, 4, 12)>
10. <5, (0, 19, 12)>
11. <12, (16, 9, 5)>
12. <1, (11, 16, 10)>
13. <14, (9, 18, 1)>
14. <13, (3)>
15. <17, (16, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. [15]
