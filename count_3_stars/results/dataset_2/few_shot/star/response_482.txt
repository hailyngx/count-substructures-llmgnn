Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Given the adjacency list, we have the following central nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 6, 2, 0)

Next, we will list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 2, 0)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get [2].
