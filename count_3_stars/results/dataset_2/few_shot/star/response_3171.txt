Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4)

Response:
Based on the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (15, 0, 10)>
<15, (3, 2, 11)>
<2, (15, 5, 18)>
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (17, 9, 11)>
<4, (13, 19, 5)>
<5, (8, 2, 18)>
<6, (13, 7, 12)>
<7, (0, 17, 6)>
<8, (19, 5, 17)>
<9, (1, 11, 15)>
<10, (3, 12, 4)>
<11, (15, 12, 9)>
<12, (2, 10, 6)>
<13, (16, 4, 6)>
<16, (13, 4, 3)>
<17, (8, 1, 19)>
<18, (2, 5, 8)>
<19, (8, 17, 4)>

By counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are 19 such 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
