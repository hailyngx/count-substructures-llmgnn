Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (4, 15, 18)>
<9, (2, 6, 11)>
<6, (2, 9, 19)>
<7, (0, 10, 13)>
<12, (1, 2, 19)>
<3, (2, 4, 14)>
<15, (5, 14, 19)>
<16, (0, 14, 7)>
<8, (0, 11, 18)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
