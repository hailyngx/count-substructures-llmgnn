Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can examine each node as a potential center of a 3-star graph and count the number of 3-stars for each node. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars centered at that node:

1. Node 0: <0, (7, 4, 18)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 10, 15)>
3. Node 2: <2, (13, 9, -)>
4. Node 3: <3, (13, 4, 8)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 9, 15)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 10, 13)>
7. Node 6: <6, (16, 14, 17)>
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 8, 18)>
9. Node 8: <8, (7, 14, 17)>
10. Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>
11. Node 10: <10, (1, 5, 12)>
12. Node 11: <11, (16, 17, -)>
13. Node 12: <12, (10, 19, -)>
14. Node 13: <13, (2, 3, 5)>
15. Node 14: <14, (6, 8, -)>
16. Node 15: <15, (1, 4, -)>
17. Node 16: <16, (6, 9, 18)>
18. Node 17: <17, (6, 8, 11)>
19. Node 18: <18, (0, 7, 16)>
20. Node 19: <19, (7, 12, -)>

Counting the number of 3-stars for each node, we find that there are 20 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
