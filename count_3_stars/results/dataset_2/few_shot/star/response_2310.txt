Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (15, 1, 10)>
<1, (14, 17, 0)>
<2, (11, 14, 4)>
<3, (10, 8, 12)>
<4, (14, 19, 2)>
<5, (16, 9, 13)>
<6, (11)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (16, 10, 0)>
<9, (5, 7, 19)>
<10, (3, 8, 12, 0)>
<11, (16, 14, 18, 6)>
<12, (3, 2, 10)>
<13, (15, 17, 5, 18)>
<14, (11, 1, 4, 2)>
<15, (0, 13)>
<16, (11, 8, 5)>
<17, (1, 13, 19)>
<18, (11, 2, 13)>
<19, (17, 9, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph: [20].
