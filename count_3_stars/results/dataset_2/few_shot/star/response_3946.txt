Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (7, 14, 8)>

2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (21, 26, 25)>

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-star centered at Node 2.

4. For Node 3:
   - <3, (15, 28, 17)>
   - <3, (15, 28, 14)>

5. For Node 4:
   - No 3-star centered at Node 4.

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-star centered at Node 5.

7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (2, 27, 19)>
   - <6, (2, 10, 27)>

8. For Node 7:
   - <7, (12, 13, 0)>

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-star centered at Node 8.

10. For Node 9:
    - <9, (25, 13, 8)>
    - <9, (25, 13, 23)>
    - <9, (25, 9, 23)>

11. For Node 10:
    - <10, (15, 28, 6)>
    - <10, (15, 28, 2)>

12. For Node 11:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 11.

13. For Node 12:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 12.

14. For Node 13:
    - <13, (4, 17, 16)>
    - <13, (4, 17, 9)>
    - <13, (4, 16, 23)>

15. For Node 14:
    - <14, (21, 3, 0)>
    - <14, (21, 3, 26)>
    - <14, (21, 3, 23)>

16. For Node 15:
    - <15, (3, 10, 21)>
    - <15, (3, 10, 11)>

17. For Node 16:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 16.

18. For Node 17:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 17.

19. For Node 18:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 18.

20. For Node 19:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 19.

21. For Node 20:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 20.

22. For Node 21:
    - <21, (15, 1, 14)>

23. For Node 22:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 22.

24. For Node 23:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 23.

25. For Node 24:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 24.

26. For Node 25:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 25.

27. For Node 26:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 26.

28. For Node 27:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 27.

29. For Node 28:
    - No 3-star centered at Node 28.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
