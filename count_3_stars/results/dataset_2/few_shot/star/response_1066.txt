Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by first finding the number of 3-stars centered at each node and then summing them all up. 

Let's identify the 3-stars centered at each node:
1. Centered at node 0: <0, (8, 14, 16)> 
2. Centered at node 1: <1, (21, 20, 24)> 
3. Centered at node 2: <2, (9, 22, 16)> 
4. Centered at node 3: <3, (13, 18, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 3)
5. Centered at node 4: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
6. Centered at node 5: <5, (22, 28, 16)> 
7. Centered at node 6: <6, (17, 26, 27)> 
8. Centered at node 7: <7, (1, 28, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 7)
9. Centered at node 8: <8, (13, 25, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 8)
10. Centered at node 9: <9, (4, 2, 24)> 
11. Centered at node 10: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
12. Centered at node 11: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
13. Centered at node 12: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
14. Centered at node 13: <13, (8, 14, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 13)
15. Centered at node 14: <14, (13, 0, 27)> 
16. Centered at node 15: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
17. Centered at node 16: <16, (21, 5, 0)> and <16, (21, 2, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 16 in the second case)
18. Centered at node 17: <17, (21, 29, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 17)
19. Centered at node 18: <18, (1, 15, 3)> 
20. Centered at node 19: <19, (23, 29, 14)> 
21. Centered at node 20: <20, (1, 6, 26)> 
22. Centered at node 21: <21, (1, 16, 26)> 
23. Centered at node 22: <22, (5, 23, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 22)
24. Centered at node 23: <23, (22, 11, 19)> 
25. Centered at node 24: <24, (1, 9, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 24)
26. Centered at node 25: <25, (8, 11, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 25)
27. Centered at node 26: <26, (21, 29, 6)> and <26, (21, 20, X)> (There are only two leaves connected to node 26 in the second case)
28. Centered at node 27: No 3-stars as it only has one connection 
29. Centered at node 28: <28, (5, 7, 15)> 
30. Centered at node 29: <29, (17, 19, 26)> 

Counting all the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
