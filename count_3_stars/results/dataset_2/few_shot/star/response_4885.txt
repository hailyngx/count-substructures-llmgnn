Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

We will first find the nodes that are connected by edges to each node to identify the 3-stars. Then we will count how many 3-stars exist.

Starting with the center node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15 and 13.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 0, and 8. (1 possible 3-star)
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0 and 12.

Moving on to the center node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11 and 6.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 1, 9, 18, 15. (1 possible 3-star)
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 1, and 2.

Continuing to investigate other nodes in a similar manner, we can find all possible 3-stars in the graph. Finally, we will count the number of unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (15, 11, 17)>.
<1, (11, 9, 6)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
