Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node's connections and identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

The number of 3-stars = (number of nodes) - (number of edges) 

The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, so 

Number of 3-stars = 10 - 40 = -30 

As the result is negative, it indicates an issue with the given input, possibly some incorrect information was provided or an error in counting.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 

<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 0, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
