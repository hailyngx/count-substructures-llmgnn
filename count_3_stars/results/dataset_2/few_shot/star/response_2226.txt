Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and the edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars. Let's identify them:

1. Let's check each node:
   - Node 0: <0, (8, 23, 28)>
   - Node 1: <1, (21, 25, 20)>
   - Node 2: <2, (11, 21, 18)>
   - Node 3: <3, (28, 6, 12)>
   - Node 4: <4, (11, 15, -)>
   - Node 5: <5, (8, 17, 19)>
   - Node 6: <6, (7, 17, 3)>
   - Node 7: <7, (20, 6, 22)>
   - Node 8: <8, (5, 0, -)>
   - Node 9: <9, (17, 22, 15)>
   - Node 10: No 3-star
   - Node 11: <11, (16, 4, 2)>
   - Node 12: No 3-star
   - Node 13: No 3-star
   - Node 14: <14, (18, 28, 5)>
   - Node 15: <15, (26, 9, 14)>
   - Node 16: <16, (11, -, -)>
   - Node 17: <17, (6, 9, 5)>
   - Node 18: <18, (17, 2, 14)>
   - Node 19: <19, (2, 5, -)>
   - Node 20: <20, (11, 1, 7)>
   - Node 21: <21, (1, 23, 2)>
   - Node 22: <22, (7, 26, 9)>
   - Node 23: <23, (21, 29, 0)>
   - Node 24: <24, (1, 20, -)>
   - Node 25: <25, (11, 1, 12)>
   - Node 26: <26, (22, 28, 15)>
   - Node 27: No 3-star
   - Node 28: <28, (26, 3, 0)>
   - Node 29: <29, (13, 18, 23)>

2. Count of 3-stars: [15]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
