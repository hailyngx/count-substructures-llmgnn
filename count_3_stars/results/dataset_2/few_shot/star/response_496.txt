Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <0, (5, 3, 14)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 13, 10)>
4. <3, (1, 0, 13)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 1)>
6. <5, (9, 13, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 12, 13)>
8. <8, (3, 14, 6)>
9. <10, (7, 14, 8)>
10. <11, (14, 8, 0)>
11. <12, (9, 7, 13)>
12. <13, (5, 3, 12)>
13. <14, (5, 0, 11)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13. Thus, the final answer is [13].
