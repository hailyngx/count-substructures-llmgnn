Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the graph step by step:
1. For each node, check if it forms any 3-star with its neighbors. 
2. If a 3-star is found, list it.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (0, 6, 16)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (10, 11, 12)>
<6, (11, 17, 3)>
<7, (12, 8, 14)>
<13, (18, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
