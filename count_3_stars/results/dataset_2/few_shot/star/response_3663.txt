Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node and three leaf nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
