Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 18) (4, 17) (4, 19) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 12)

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we will look for each node in the graph and count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center. A 3-star consists of the center node and exactly three other nodes connected to the center.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (11, 7, 19)>
<4, (17, 19, 9)>
<5, (10, 13, 0)>
<6, (9, 13, 6)>
<7, (11, 9, 3)>
<8, (16, 1, 18)>
<9, (6, 10, 19)>
<10, (5, 13, 0)>
<11, (16, 3, 7)>
<12, (1, 14, 18)>
<13, (6, 10, 15)>
<14, (7, 19, 12)>
<15, (17, 13, 5)>
<16, (11, 3, 8)>
<17, (10, 0, 15)>
<18, (1, 8, 17)>
<19, (9, 4, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
