Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. Let's go through the given graph and find 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7. (3-star found)
2. Node 1 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 10. (3-star found)
4. Node 3 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 9, and 1. (3-star found)
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 0. (3-star found)
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0. (3-star found)
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 14. (3-star found)
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 1. (3-star found)
10. Node 9 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 13 (duplicate, should only count once).
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 2. (3-star found)
13. Node 12 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 10. (3-star found)
15. Node 14 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
16. Node 15 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
17. Node 16 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 8, and 2 (duplicate, should only count once).
19. Node 18 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
20. Node 19 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (11, 17, 10)>
<4, (12, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 17, 0)>
<7, (6, 0, 14)>
<8, (17, 19, 1)>
<11, (0, 13, 2)>
<13, (11, 7, 10)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [8].
