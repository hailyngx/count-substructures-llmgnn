Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on this definition.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0: {1, 3, 10, 11, 14}
1: {3, 6, 11, 13, 0}
2: {8, 7, 6, 14}
3: {1, 0, 6, 12}
4: {5}
5: {8, 11, 4, 7}
6: {1, 3, 8, 2, 13}
7: {5, 9, 11, 8, 2}
8: {5, 9, 2, 6, 7}
9: {8, 11, 10, 7}
10: {9, 0, 14}
11: {5, 9, 1, 7, 0}
12: {3, 13, 14}
13: {1, 12, 6}
14: {10, 12, 2, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. From node 0: (1, 3, 11), (1, 11, 14), (3, 6, 1), (3, 1, 0)
2. From node 1: (3, 6, 1), (3, 1, 0)
3. From node 2: (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 2), (8, 6, 13), (7, 2, 6)
4. From node 3: (1, 0, 3)
5. From node 5: (8, 5, 7), (5, 7, 11), (5, 11, 9)
6. From node 6: (3, 1, 6), (3, 6, 13)
7. From node 8: (5, 8, 7), (5, 8, 6), (5, 8, 3), (7, 2, 8), (7, 8, 6)
8. From node 9: (8, 9, 11), (8, 9, 10)
9. From node 11: (9, 11, 5), (9, 11, 1)
10. From node 12: (1, 12, 13), (3, 12, 13)
11. From node 13: (1, 13, 6), (6, 13, 12)
12. From node 14: (10, 14, 0), (12, 14, 13), (2, 14, 0)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
