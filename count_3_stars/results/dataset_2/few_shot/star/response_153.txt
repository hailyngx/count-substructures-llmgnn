Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph is the center, and the three connected nodes are referred to as leaves. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 3)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (9, 4, 7)>
5. Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 3)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 8)>
8. Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 3)>
9. Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 4)>
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find a total of [10].
