Response:
Steps to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors.
2. For each node found in step 1, check if it is the center of a 3-star by verifying the connections between its neighbors.
3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's perform the steps:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:  
- Node 8: (11, 16, 8)  
- Node 9: (10, 27, 28)  
- Node 10: (22, 23, 6)  
- Node 14: (11, 20, 14)  
- Node 15: (4, 18, 15)  
- Node 20: (19, 14, 20)  
- Node 21: (0, 29, 21)  
- Node 22: (10, 7, 22)  
- Node 23: (10, 28, 23)  
- Node 24: (25, 16, 24)  
- Node 29: (12, 0, 21)  

2. Checking for 3-stars:  
- For Node 8: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 9: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 10: <10, (22, 6, 28)>  
- For Node 14: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 15: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 20: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 21: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 22: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 23: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 24: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  
- For Node 29: No 3-star as its neighbors are not connected to form a 3-star.  

3. Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Result:  
[1]
