Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node in the graph and summing them up.

Let's count the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0 has 0 3-stars (not a center of any 3-star)
- Node 1 has 1 3-star: <1, (13)>
- Node 2 has 1 3-star: <2, (23, 10, 15)>
- Node 3 has 5 3-stars: <3, (25, 7, 10)>, <3, (25, 7, 4)>, <3, (25, 7, 8)>, <3, (25, 7, 3)>, <3, (25, 8, 13)>
- Node 4 has 1 3-star: <4, (3, 18, 27)>
- Node 5 has 1 3-star: <5, (23, 12, 11)>
- Node 6 has 0 3-stars
- Node 7 has 1 3-star: <7, (3, 8, 13)>
- Node 8 has 1 3-star: <8, (3, 13, 28)>
- Node 9 has 1 3-star: <9, (15, 17, 24)>
- Node 10 has 0 3-stars
- Node 11 has 1 3-star: <11, (25, 23, 5)>
- Node 12 has 0 3-stars
- Node 13 has 1 3-star: <13, (8, 20, 0)>
- Node 14 has 0 3-stars
- Node 15 has 1 3-star: <15, (9, 17, 24)>
- Node 16 has 0 3-stars
- Node 17 has 1 3-star: <17, (27, 18, 21)>
- Node 18 has 0 3-stars
- Node 19 has 0 3-stars
- Node 20 has 0 3-stars
- Node 21 has 0 3-stars
- Node 22 has 0 3-stars
- Node 23 has 0 3-stars
- Node 24 has 0 3-stars
- Node 25 has 1 3-star: <25, (11, 23, 5)>
- Node 26 has 0 3-stars
- Node 27 has 0 3-stars
- Node 28 has 0 3-stars
- Node 29 has 0 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 13 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (13)>
<2, (23, 10, 15)>
<3, (25, 7, 10)>
<3, (25, 7, 4)>
<3, (25, 7, 8)>
<3, (25, 7, 3)>
<3, (25, 8, 13)>
<4, (3, 18, 27)>
<5, (23, 12, 11)>
<7, (3, 8, 13)>
<8, (3, 13, 28)>
<9, (15, 17, 24)>
<11, (25, 23, 5)>
