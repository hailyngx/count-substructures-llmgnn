Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 14, 10, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 13, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 11, 10, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 14, 11, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 11, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 14, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 3, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 12, 11, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (12, 14, 10)>
<1, (4, 13, 6)>
<2, (4, 3, 1)>
<3, (13, 11, 10)>
<4, (9, 1, 11)>
<5, (9, 13)>
<6, (12, 14, 11)>
<7, (11, 14)>
<8, (9, 12, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<10, (9, 0, 3)>
<11, (4, 7, 13)>
<12, (13, 0, 6)>
<13, (5, 12, 11)>
<14, (9, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
