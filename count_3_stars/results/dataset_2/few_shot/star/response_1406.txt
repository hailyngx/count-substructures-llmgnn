Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

<14, (17, 22, 15)>
<17, (14, 3, 16)>
<18, (26, 5, 4)>
<22, (14, 28, 17)>
<3, (17, 25, 7)>
<25, (3, 12, 10)>
<0, (20, 24, 12)>
<20, (0, 29, 7)>
<1, (15, 2, 28)>
<26, (18, 5, 4)>
<19, (20, 8, 28)>
<6, (21, 13, 0)>
<21, (6, 24, 13)>
<15, (14, 1, 8)>
<9, (29, 4, 2)>
<27, (1, 5, 28)>
<11, (20, 29, 5)>

These are all the unique 3-stars present in the given graph. The total count of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
