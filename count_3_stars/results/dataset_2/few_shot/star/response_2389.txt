Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes via edges. If yes, then form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (8, 2, 11)>
<2, (10, 18, 11)>
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (17, 19, 11)>
<5, (3, 7, 5)>
<6, (3, 8, 13)>
<9, (8, 16, 13)>
<10, (2, 16, 14)>
<11, (17, 18, 0)>
<13, (15, 9, 6)>
<14, (10, 12, 19)>
<15, (1, 13, 15)>
<16, (10, 9, 16)>
<17, (19, 11, 4)>
<18, (2, 11, 7)>
<19, (17, 14, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

There are [16] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
