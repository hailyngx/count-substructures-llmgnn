Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
Nodes 0, 4, and 9 have exactly three neighbors each.

Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 8. <0, (5, 2, 8)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 7. <4, (6, 1, 7)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 7. <9, (8, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
