Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can easily identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes. We will ignore the direction of the edges since the star pattern is symmetrical.

The central nodes and their leaf nodes are as follows:
- Central node 0 with leaf nodes 10, 7, and 16
- Central node 1 with leaf nodes 3, 16, and 10
- Central node 5 with leaf nodes 8, 13, and 19
- Central node 6 with leaf nodes 13, 7, 18, and 15
- Central node 7 with leaf nodes 3, 13, 0, and 6
- Central node 8 with leaf nodes 5, 14, and 12
- Central node 9 with leaf nodes 7, 4, and 18
- Central node 10 with leaf nodes 1, 0, and 12
- Central node 11 with leaf nodes 2, 13, and 18
- Central node 12 with leaf nodes 10 and 8
- Central node 13 with leaf nodes 5, 11, 14, 7, and 6
- Central node 14 with leaf nodes 8, 13, and 18
- Central node 15 with leaf nodes 17, 19, and 6
- Central node 16 with leaf nodes 1, 5, and 0
- Central node 17 with leaf nodes 19 and 15
- Central node 18 with leaf nodes 11, 14, 9, and 6
- Central node 19 with leaf nodes 17, 5, and 15

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

<Total number of 3-stars is [18]>.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 7, 16)>
<1, (3, 10, 16)>
<5, (8, 13, 19)>
<6, (7, 13, 18)>
<7, (3, 0, 13)>
<8, (5, 12, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 18)>
<10, (0, 1, 12)>
<11, (2, 13, 18)>
<13, (5, 11, 14)>
<14, (8, 13, 18)>
<15, (17, 19, 6)>
<16, (0, 1, 5)>
<17, (15, 19)>
<18, (6, 9, 11)>
<19, (15, 17, 5)>
