Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, and 8. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 3, and 8. <2, (9, 3, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 4, and 7. <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 7, and 1. <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 8, and 0. <6, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
