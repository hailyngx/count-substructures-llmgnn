Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of 3-stars.  

From the adjacency list:
- Node 1 is connected to 6 other nodes, not 3.
- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes, not 3.
- Node 5 is connected to 6 other nodes, not 3.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes, which makes it a potential central node for a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes, not 3.

Therefore, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are Node 8.

Step 2: For each potential central node, determine the nodes connected to it and form 3-stars if the conditions are satisfied.

For Node 8:
- (8, 7, 5, 1) form a 3-star.
- (8, 1, 3, 5) form a 3-star.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.

Unique 3-stars: 
<8, (7, 5, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
