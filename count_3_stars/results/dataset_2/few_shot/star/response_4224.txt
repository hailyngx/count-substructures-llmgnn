Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all potential 3-star structures. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through all nodes and their connections to find all 3-stars.

1. **Identify Central Nodes with Exactly Three Neighbors:**
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 13, 6, and 4. Here, node 11 can be the central node as it satisfies the condition.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 1, and 10. Here, node 2 cannot be a central node as it has more than three neighbors.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 1. Here, node 4 can be the central node as it satisfies the condition.
   - Node 7, 13, 14, 16, and 19 do not have exactly three neighbors, so they cannot be central nodes.

2. **Determine 3-Stars with Central Nodes 11 and 4:**
   - For central node 11: (11, 16, 17, 18), (11, 7, 2, 10), (11, 13, 9, 19), (11, 6) are all 3-stars.
   - For central node 4: (4, 11, 15, 1) is a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<11, (16, 17, 18)>, <11, (7, 2, 10)>, <11, (13, 9, 19)>, <11, (6)>, <4, (15, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
