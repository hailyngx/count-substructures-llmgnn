Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the graph details, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 2, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
