Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star centered at Node 0: <0, (6, 8, 18)>
2. 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 11)>
3. 3-star centered at Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. 3-star centered at Node 3: <3, (11, 0, 18)>
5. 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (7, 13, 17)>
6. 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (9, 10, 0)>
7. 3-star centered at Node 8: <8, (2, 19, 18)>
8. 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (6, 17, 16)>
9. 3-star centered at Node 11: <11, (3, 14, 1)>
10. 3-star centered at Node 16: <16, (9, 12, 14)>
11. 3-star centered at Node 18: <18, (9, 8, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
