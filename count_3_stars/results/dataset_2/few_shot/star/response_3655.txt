Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These configurations represent 3-stars, where the central node and the three leaf nodes form a star-like structure.

Observing the given graph and the adjacency list, we can list down all unique 3-stars:

<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>

Counting the number of these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in total.
