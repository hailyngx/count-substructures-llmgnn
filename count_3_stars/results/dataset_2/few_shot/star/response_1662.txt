Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding all possible combinations where a node has exactly three neighbors connected to it.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can find the following 3-stars:

<4, (9, 3, 11)>
<5, (9, 10, 16)>
<7, (1, 12, 17)>
<8, (13, 2, 19)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<11, (9, 13, 18)>
<12, (13, 7, 17)>
<13, (8, 17, 11)>
<14, (0, 1, 16)>
<15, (2, 14, 19)>
<16, (9, 2, 14)>
<17, (13, 7, 2)>
<18, (19, 11)>
<19, (8, 7, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14] when considering unique combinations, as some nodes may have more than one 3-star associated with them.
