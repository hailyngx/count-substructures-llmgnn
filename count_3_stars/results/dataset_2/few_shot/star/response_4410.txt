Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all combinations of 3 nodes that form a 3-star with one node as the center and the other two nodes as leaves. We can then count how many times each 3-star appears in the graph.

Based on the given adjacency list, the possible 3-stars can be listed as follows:
<0, (8, 5, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 11)>
<1, (9, 3, 12)>
<1, (9, 1, 12)>
<2, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 12)>
<4, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (11, 12, 4)>
<4, (11, 2, 14)>
<5, (3, 10, 8)>
<8, (13, 11, 3)>
<8, (13, 14, 11)>
<9, (14, 10, 9)>
<12, (9, 1, 12)>
<12, (9, 3, 12)>
<12, (4, 11, 12)>
<14, (6, 10, 14)>
<14, (6, 4, 14)>

Now, we count how many times each of these unique 3-stars appears in the given graph:

<0, (8, 5, 7)> - Appears once
<1, (9, 3, 11)> - Appears once
<1, (9, 3, 12)> - Appears once
<1, (9, 1, 12)> - Appears once
<2, (1, 7, 4)> - Does not appear
<3, (1, 11, 13)> - Appears once
<3, (1, 5, 12)> - Does not appear
<4, (6, 11, 14)> - Does not appear
<4, (11, 12, 4)> - Appears once
<4, (11, 2, 14)> - Does not appear
<5, (3, 10, 8)> - Does not appear
<8, (13, 11, 3)> - Does not appear
<8, (13, 14, 11)> - Does not appear
<9, (14, 10, 9)> - Does not appear
<12, (9, 1, 12)> - Appears once
<12, (9, 3, 12)> - Does not appear
<12, (4, 11, 12)> - Does not appear
<14, (6, 10, 14)> - Does not appear
<14, (6, 4, 14)> - Does not appear

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
