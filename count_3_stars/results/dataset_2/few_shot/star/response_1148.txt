Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (0, 25, 20)>
<4, (7, 26, 12)>
<5, (29, 12, 17)>
<6, (9, 25, 28)>
<7, (11, 16, 14)>
<8, (10, 15, 6)>
<9, (12, 19, 28)>
<10, (19, 15, 29)>
<11, (27, 7, 13)>
<12, (9, 4, 28)>
<15, (8, 23, 10)>
<16, (7, 27, 11)>
<17, (5, 24, 0)>
<18, (21, 24, 14)>
<19, (9, 0, 10)>
<20, (27, 3, 18)>
<21, (27, 18, 25)>
<22, (26, 2, 2)>
<23, (15, 24, 24)>
<24, (17, 3, 18)>
<25, (21, 6, 3)>
<26, (22, 4, 2)>
<27, (16, 2, 21)>
<28, (12, 6, 1)>
<29, (5, 10, 0)>

Hence, there are a total of [25] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
