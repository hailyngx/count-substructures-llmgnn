Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph.

We can identify a 3-star when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8: <7, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 1: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
9. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 9: <0, (5, 2, 9)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the count is [9].
