Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (7, 1) (7, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (3, 16) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 4) (0, 19) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 19
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 7

Node 3 is connected to node 16, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 19, 18, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 18, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 19
Node 8 is connected to node 16, 9, 1, and node 18
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 6, and node 8

Node 18 is connected to node 6, 14, 8, and node 5
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 15, 7, 0, and node 12

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 16: (11, 15, 8)
2. Node 6: (9, 18, 4)
3. Node 8: (16, 9, 1)
4. Node 15: (16, 14, 13)
5. Node 4: (6, 0, 3)
6. Node 5: (19, 18, 1)
7. Node 19: (15, 7, 0)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<16, (11, 15, 8)>, 
<6, (9, 18, 4)>, 
<8, (16, 9, 1)>, 
<15, (16, 14, 13)>, 
<4, (6, 0, 3)>, 
<5, (19, 18, 1)>,
<19, (15, 7, 0)>.
