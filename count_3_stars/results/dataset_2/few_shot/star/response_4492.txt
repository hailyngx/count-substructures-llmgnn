Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Look at each node in the graph:
   - Node 0: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 1: <1, (7, 0, 6)>
   - Node 2: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 3: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 4: <4, (6, 16, 17)>
   - Node 5: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 6: No 3-stars, only connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 7: <7, (13, 12, 1)>
   - Node 8: No 3-stars, only connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 9: <9, (13, 14, 17)>
   - Node 10: No 3-stars, only connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 11: <11, (8, 0, 15)>
   - Node 12: <12, (18, 7, 17)>
   - Node 13: <13, (8, 9, 7)>
   - Node 14: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 15: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 16: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 17: <17, (2, 12, 9)>
   - Node 18: No 3-stars, only connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 19: No 3-stars, only connected to 3 other nodes.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - Total = 4 unique 3-stars

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 16, 17)>
<7, (13, 12, 1)>
<9, (13, 14, 17)>
