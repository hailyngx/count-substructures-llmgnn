Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes and visualize them. Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars:

<11, (16, 14, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (11, 1, 19)>
<4, (1, 5, -)>
<5, (4, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 17, 14)>
<8, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (11, 8, 15)>
<10, (15, 18, 2)>
<12, (3, 14, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, -)>
<14, (11, 6, 0)>
<15, (9, 10, 7)>
<16, (11, 17, -)>
<17, (16, 6, 18)>
<18, (14, 10, 17)>
<19, (3, 9, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
