Response:
Let's first find the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (15, 16, 4)>
<1, (6, 11, 8)>
<2, (3, 15, 17)>
<3, (7, 10, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (8, 4, 13)>
<6, (17, 1, 4)>
<7, (3, 9, 10)>
<8, (17, 5, 12)>
<9, (3, 11, 7)>
<10, (3, 7, 13)>
<11, (14, 1, 12)>
<12, (14, 8, 11)>
<13, (19, 4, 10)>
<14, (17, 11, 12)>
<15, (0, 18, 2)>
<16, (14, 0)>
<17, (14, 6, 8)>
<19, (13, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 20 nodes in the graph, so there can be at most 20 3-stars, each with a different central node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
