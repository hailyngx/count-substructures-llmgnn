Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. The center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the valid center nodes are: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.

Next, for each potential center node, we find the nodes that are connected to it to form a 3-star. 

For center node 0:
- <0, (5, 4, 3)>
- <0, (5, 4, 1)>

For center node 1:
- <1, (8, 2, 0)>
- <1, (8, 2, 7)>

For center node 2:
- <2, (6, 8, 1)>
- <2, (6, 8, 3)>

For center node 8:
- <8, (2, 3, 1)>


Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
