Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 14 forms a 3-star with connected nodes 16, 18, and 4.
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with connected nodes 16, 5, and 13.
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with connected nodes 8, 7, and 17.
4. Node 0 forms a 3-star with connected nodes 3, 19, and 6.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<14, (16, 18, 4)>
<9, (16, 5, 13)>
<1, (8, 7, 17)>
<0, (3, 19, 6)>
