Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star contains a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that satisfy this condition. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 9, 11)>
2. <0, (5, 9, 6)>
3. <1, (5, 4, 12)>
4. <1, (5, 4, 8)>
5. <2, (5, 10, 8)>
6. <2, (5, 10, 6)>
7. <3, (7, 6, 13)>
8. <4, (10, 14, 1)>
9. <7, (12, 14, 13)>
10. <9, (5, 8, 12)>
11. <10, (4, 11, 13)>
12. <11, (5, 10, 0)>
13. <12, (9, 7, 11)>
14. <13, (7, 10, 14)>
15. <14, (4, 7, 8)>

These are all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Now, we need to count the number of 3-stars, which is the total count of unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
