Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This indicates the presence of a 3-star configuration with that node as the center.

From the adjacency list provided, the following 3-stars are found in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (8, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
