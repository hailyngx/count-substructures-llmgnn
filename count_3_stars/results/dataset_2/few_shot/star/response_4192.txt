Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<[0, (9, 6, 1)]>  
<[0, (9, 7, 8)]>  
<[0, (6, 8, 1)]>  
<[2, (3, 4, 7)]>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
