Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 

Given that a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes in the graph that have three edges connected to them. 

Nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 10 has edges to nodes 7, 21, 15
- Node 17 has edges to nodes 29, 21, 25
- Node 27 has edges to nodes 26, 17, 4

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<10, (7, 21, 15)>
<17, (29, 21, 25)>
<27, (26, 17, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
