Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors.
2. Check if there are any 3-stars centered at each node.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we summarize the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 10, 4, 12
- Node 1: 9, 3, 10, 4
- Node 2: 9, 6, 13, 7
- Node 3: 1, 11, 14, 13
- Node 4: 9, 6, 1, 11, 0, 12
- Node 5: 9, 8
- Node 6: 14, 2, 11, 4
- Node 7: 11, 0, 14, 2
- Node 8: 5, 11, 10
- Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 1
- Node 10: 1, 13, 0, 12, 8
- Node 11: 6, 3, 14, 7, 8, 4
- Node 12: 0, 4, 10
- Node 13: 3, 2, 10
- Node 14: 6, 3, 11, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- From Node 1: <1, (9, 10, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 4)>
- From Node 2: <2, (9, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 13, 7)>
- From Node 3: <3, (1, 11, 14)>, <3, (13, 11, 14)>
- From Node 4: <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 11, 6)>, <4, (9, 1, 11)>, <4, (0, 11, 6)>
- From Node 6: <6, (14, 11, 7)>, <6, (2, 11, 7)>
- From Node 7: <7, (11, 14, 2)>, <7, (11, 0, 14)>
- From Node 8: <8, (5, 11, 10)>, <8, (11, 10, 13)>
- From Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>
- From Node 10: <10, (1, 13, 0)>, <10, (13, 0, 12)>, <10, (0, 12, 10)>
- From Node 11: <11, (6, 14, 7)>, <11, (3, 14, 7)>, <11, (7, 14, 6)>, <11, (6, 3, 14)>, <11, (6, 4, 0)>, <11, (0, 4, 12)>
- From Node 12: <12, (0, 4, 10)>, <12, (4, 10, 13)>
- From Node 13: <13, (3, 2, 10)>, <13, (3, 10, 1)>
- From Node 14: <14, (6, 11, 7)>, <14, (3, 11, 7)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [15].
