Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list and edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<5, (6, 3)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (7, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
