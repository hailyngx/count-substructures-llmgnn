Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we know that the possible central nodes for the 3-stars are: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13.
- For each central node, we will check the connected nodes to form 3-stars.
- Count the unique 3-stars.

By examining the connections, we find the following 3-stars:

<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (6, 13, 5)>
<10, (11, 9, 0)>
<11, (10, 9, 6)>
<12, (11, 6, 2)>
<13, (7, 6, 3)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars, we find: [6].
