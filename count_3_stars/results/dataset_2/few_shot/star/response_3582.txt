Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.
Let's go step by step:
1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each such node, check if it forms a 3-star pattern with its adjacent nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[15]

<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 11, 10)>
<7, (4, 2, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 12)>
<10, (12, 0, 14)>
<11, (5, 6, 12)>
<12, (7, 10, 8)>
<14, (10, 1, 8)>
