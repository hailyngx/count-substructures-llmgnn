Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for a 3-star are nodes: 6, 9, 15, 8, 12, 13, and 14.

2. Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars:
    - For central node 6: <6, (9, 15, 16)>, <6, (9, 15, 11)>, <6, (9, 15, 19)>, and <6, (15, 16, 11)>.
    - For central node 9: <9, (6, 4, 10)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, and <9, (4, 10, 12)>.
    - For central node 15: <15, (6, 0, 7)>, <15, (6, 0, 11)>, <15, (6, 7, 11)>, and <15, (0, 7, 11)>.
    - For central node 8: <8, (3, 2, 11)>, <8, (3, 2, 12)>, and <8, (2, 11, 12)>.
    - For central node 12: <12, (13, 10, 14)>, and <12, (8, 10, 14)>.
    - For central node 13: <13, (3, 12, 14)>.
    - For central node 14: <14, (18, 12, 13)>.

3. Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13].   
   
   The unique 3-stars are: 
   <6, (9, 15, 16)>, 
   <6, (9, 15, 11)>, 
   <6, (9, 15, 19)>, 
   <6, (15, 16, 11)>, 
   <9, (6, 4, 10)>, 
   <9, (6, 4, 7)>, 
   <9, (4, 10, 12)>, 
   <15, (6, 0, 7)>, 
   <15, (6, 0, 11)>, 
   <15, (6, 7, 11)>, 
   <15, (0, 7, 11)>, 
   <8, (3, 2, 12)>, 
   <14, (18, 12, 13)>
