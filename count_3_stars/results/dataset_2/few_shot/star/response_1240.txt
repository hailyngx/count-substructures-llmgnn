Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each occurrence where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This would satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Check each node and look for nodes with exactly three connections.
2. For each node found with three connections, consider it as the central node of the 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars and count them:

There are two unique 3-stars found:
<4, (23, 28, 0)>
<(23, 4, 28), 25>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
