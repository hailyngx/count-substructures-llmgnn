Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. In this case, the central nodes are {5, 9, 1, 4, 7, and 2}. 

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node: 
- Central node 5 has leaves {9, 2, 8, 1, 7}.
- Central node 9 has leaves {5, 2, 7, 0}.
- Central node 1 has leaves {5, 4, 2}.
- Central node 4 has leaves {3, 1, 6}.
- Central node 7 has leaves {5, 9, 0, 6, 8}.
- Central node 2 has leaves {5, 9, 1, 3, 0}.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Central node 5: Represents the 3-star <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>
- Central node 9: Represents the 3-star <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>
- Central node 1: Represents the 3-star <1, (5, 4, 2)>
- Central node 4: Represents the 3-star <4, (3, 1, 6)>
- Central node 7: Represents the 3-star <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 6, 0)>, <7, (9, 8, 0)>
- Central node 2: Represents the 3-star <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 3, 1)>, <2, (5, 0, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <2, (9, 0, 1)>, <2, (3, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
