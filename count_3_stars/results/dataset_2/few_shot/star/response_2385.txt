Node 3 is connected to node 0, 13, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 13, 10, 14, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 12, 0, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 14, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 2, 13, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 14, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 0, and node 13

Response:
We will start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 5, 14, and 9. 
- Checking each combination, there are no 3-stars involving Node 0.

Next, Node 1:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 7, 6, and 2.
- Checking each combination, there are no 3-stars involving Node 1.

Proceeding in this manner, we can analyze each node's connections to find the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars we find: 

<4, (7, 13, 6)>
<5, (2, 10, 14)>
<7, (11, 2, 1)>
<8, (9, 3, 6)>
<13, (10, 14, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
