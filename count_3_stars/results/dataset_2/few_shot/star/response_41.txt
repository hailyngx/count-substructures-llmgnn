Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the possible 3-stars will be formed around a node that has exactly three edges connected to other nodes since these will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

From the given information, we can observe the following central nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 3, 2, and 0
- Node 4: connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
- Node 7: connected to nodes 5, 1, 3

Thus, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 2, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
