Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. 
Let's go step by step:
1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 2.
   - Hence, the number of 3-stars centered at Node 0 is 0.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 14, and 12.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (9, 14, 12)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 14, and 13.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 6, 13, and 8.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 3: <3, (1, 14, 8)>

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 11.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 11)>

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 12, and 10.
   - There are two 3-stars centered at Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)> and <5, (9, 12, 10)>

7. For Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 11.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (5, 3, 11)>

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 11, and 10.
   - There is one 3-star centered at Node 7: <7, (4, 12, 11)>

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 0, and 10.
   - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 8.

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, 14, 1, and 12.
    - There are two 3-stars centered at Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 12)> and <9, (2, 14, 1)>

11. For Node 10:
    - Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0, and 8.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 10: <10, (5, 7, 8)>

12. For Node 11:
    - Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, and 14.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 11: <11, (4, 7, 14)>

13. For Node 12:
    - Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 1.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 12: <12, (5, 9, 7)>

14. For Node 13:
    - Node 13 is connected to nodes 3 and 2.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at Node 13.

15. For Node 14:
    - Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 11, and 2.
    - There is one 3-star centered at Node 14: <14, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 14, 12)>, <3, (1, 14, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 11)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 12, 10)>, <6, (5, 3, 11)>, <7, (4, 12, 11)>, <9, (5, 4, 12)>, <9, (2, 14, 1)>, <10, (5, 7, 8)>, <11, (4, 7, 14)>, <12, (5, 9, 7)>, and <14, (9, 1, 3)>.
