Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from each node, we will look for all possible 3-stars connected to that node.
2. For each node, we will check if there are exactly 3 edges connecting it to other nodes. If yes, we will count it as a 3-star.
3. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: No 3-stars.
- Node 2: No 3-stars.
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: No 3-stars.
- Node 5: No 3-stars.
- Node 6: No 3-stars.
- Node 7: No 3-stars.
- Node 8: No 3-stars.
- Node 9: No 3-stars.
- Node 10: No 3-stars.
- Node 11: No 3-stars.
- Node 12: No 3-stars.
- Node 13: <13, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 14: No 3-stars.
- Node 15: No 3-stars.
- Node 16: No 3-stars.
- Node 17: No 3-stars.
- Node 18: No 3-stars.
- Node 19: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <13, (1, 3, 5)>.
