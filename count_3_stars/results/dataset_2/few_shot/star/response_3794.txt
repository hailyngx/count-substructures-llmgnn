Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (7, 8, 6)>
2. Node 3: <3, (4, 8, 5)>
3. Node 4: <4, (7, 1, 6)>
4. Node 5: <5, (8, 6, 2)>
5. Node 6: <6, (4, 8, 5)>
6. Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 9)>
7. Node 8: <8, (9, 5, 0)>
8. Node 9: <9, (7, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
