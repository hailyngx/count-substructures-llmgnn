Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which form a 3-star configuration with the center node.

For each node, we will look at its neighbors and check if there exists a 3-star centered at that node. We will then count the number of such 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (14, 7, 6)>
<2, (10, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<4, (8, 2, 15)>
<5, (14, 2, 5)>
<6, (11, 1, 16)>
<7, (17, 14, 3)>
<8, (10, 11, 4)>
<9, (11, 18, 15)>
<10, (12, 10, 19)>
<11, (9, 6, 8)>
<12, (10, 3)>
<13, (18)>
<14, (17, 7, 15)>
<15, (14, 4, 9)>
<16, (8, 6, 19)>
<17, (14, 0, 7)>
<18, (9, 13)>
<19, (10, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
