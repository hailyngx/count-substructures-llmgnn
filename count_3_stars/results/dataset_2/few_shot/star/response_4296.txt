Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 19: (11, 16, 19)
- Node 12: (4, 11, 12)
- Node 15: (0, 10, 15)
- Node 8: (1, 17, 8)
- Node 10: (2, 15, 18)
- Node 17: (7, 9, 17)
- Node 16: (5, 9, 19)

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs for each of these central nodes:
- Node 19: 1 3-star centered at node 19 <19, (11, 16)>
- Node 12: 1 3-star centered at node 12 <12, (4, 11)>
- Node 15: 1 3-star centered at node 15 <15, (0, 10)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star centered at node 8 <8, (1, 17)>
- Node 10: 1 3-star centered at node 10 <10, (2, 18)>
- Node 17: 1 3-star centered at node 17 <17, (7, 9)>
- Node 16: 1 3-star centered at node 16 <16, (5, 19)>

Therefore, there are [7] unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
