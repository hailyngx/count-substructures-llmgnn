Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's calculate this step by step:

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes:**
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 0, and 14.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 10, and 13.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 6.
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 10.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 14.

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - From the above connections, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
     - <4, (12, 0, 14)>
     - <7, (12, 10, 13)>
     - <8, (13, 11, 6)>
     - <13, (7, 8, 10)>
     - <9, (13, 12, 14)>

3. **Count the Number of 3-Stars:**
   - There are 5 unique 3-stars identified.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
