Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's follow these steps:
1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these nodes, find the three nodes that are connected to them by edges. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars.
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph, represented as <center node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)>:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 14)>
<2, (6, 9, 10)>
<2, (2, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 8, 10)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 12)>
<8, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (3, 13, 14)>
<8, (7, 13, 14)>
<9, (6, 12, 13)>
<10, (2, 13, 14)>
<12, (5, 7, 9)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars we found:
