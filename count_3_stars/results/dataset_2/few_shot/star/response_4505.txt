Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is the center of a 3-star by looking at its adjacent nodes. If the number of adjacent nodes is 3, then form a 3-star with the center node and its neighbors.

2. Count the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
[10]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1]. 

The unique 3-star found in the graph is:
<10, (3, 6, 7)>
