Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three connecting nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (15, 20, 24)>
<0, (15, 20, 18)>
<0, (15, 24, 18)>
<0, (20, 24, 18)>
<1, (26, 14, 10)>
<2, (9, 25, 11)>
<4, (26, 27, 18)>
<4, (26, 27, 29)>
<4, (27, 5, 13)>
<4, (27, 18, 19)>
<7, (22, 23, 17)>
<7, (22, 12, 24)>
<7, (23, 8, 14)>
<8, (27, 23, 29)>
<10, (17, 21, 7)>
<14, (23, 8, 1)>
<15, (27, 5, 13)>
<18, (0, 4, 19)>
