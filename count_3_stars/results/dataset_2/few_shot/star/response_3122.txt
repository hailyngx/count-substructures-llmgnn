Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them in the given graph.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges and identify the nodes they are connected to.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
