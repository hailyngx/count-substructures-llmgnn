Response:
Step 1: Count the 3-stars by examining each node.  

For each node, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.  
- For the center node, if it has 3 neighbors, there will be exactly 1 3-star.  
- For the leaf nodes, if they are part of a 3-star, they must connect to a center node that has at least 2 other neighbors (in addition to the leaf node) to form a valid 3-star.  

Let's go through each node to count the 3-stars:  

Node 0: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Node 1: Possible 3-star: (1, 4, 7), (1, 3, 8)  
Total 3-stars from Node 1: 2  

Node 2: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Node 3: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Node 4: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Node 5: Possible 3-star: (5, 2, 8), (5, 7, 8)  
Total 3-stars from Node 5: 2  

Node 6: Possible 3-star: (6, 7, 8)  
Total 3-stars from Node 6: 1  

Node 7: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Node 8: Possible 3-star: (8, 7, 6), (8, 5, 9), (8, 1, 3)  
Total 3-stars from Node 8: 3  

Node 9: No 3-star can be formed because it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Step 2: Combine the 3-stars found from each node.  
<1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (3, 8, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 5)>, <5, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (7, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>  

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars:  
[8]
