Response:
The central node for each 3-star can be determined by finding nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <5, (9, 22, 4)>
- <9, (5, 22, 7)>
- <22, (5, 9, 28)>
- <4, (5, 27, 22)>
- <27, (5, 9, 15)>
- <20, (0, 17, 18)>
- <3, (2, 6, 16)>
- <7, (9, 29, 1)>
- <6, (24, 3, 8)>
- <12, (16, 26, 25)>
- <11, (28)>
- <13, (10, 21, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph and put the final answer inside brackets [].
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
