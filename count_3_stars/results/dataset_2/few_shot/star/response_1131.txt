Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (9, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
