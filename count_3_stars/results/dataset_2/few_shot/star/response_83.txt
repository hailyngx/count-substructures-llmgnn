Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (13, 10, 20)>
<1, (17, 11, 14)>
<2, (20, 15, 21)>
<3, (11, 16, 4)>
<4, (22, 17, 0)>
<5, (26, 16, 4)>
<6, (8, 24, 6)>
<7, (10, 15, 7)>
<9, (22, 25, -)>
<12, (17, 28, -)>
<13, (14, - , -)>
<18, (1, 29, -)>
<23, (11, 29, -)>
<25, (9, 8, -)>
<27, (22, 16, -)>
<28, (12, 24, -)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found: 14. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
