Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The possible 3-stars can be formed by choosing a node as the center and its three connected nodes as the leaves. Let's check for each node:
    - Node 0: <0, (7, 10, 13)>
    - Node 1: <1, (7, 11, 24)>
    - Node 2: <2, (29, 25)>
    - Node 3: <3, (9, 20, 16)>
    - Node 4: <4, (29, 13, 15)>
    - Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 23)>
    - Node 6: <6, (5, 11, 8)>
    - Node 7: <7, (0, 14, 19)>
    - Node 8: <8, (27, 6, 15)>
    - Node 9: <9, (5, 3, 0)>
    - Node 10: <10, (0, 25, 13)>
    - Node 11: <11, (6, 1, 15)>
    - Node 12: <12, (26, 19, unknown)>
    - Node 13: <13, (0, 4, 23)>
    - Node 14: <14, (7, 21, unknown)>
    - Node 15: <15, (8, 4, 22)>
    - Node 16: <16, (25, 26, 3)>
    - Node 17: <17, (28, 22, unknown)>
    - Node 18: <18, (17, 13, 16)>
    - Node 19: <19, (7, 12, unknown)>
    - Node 20: <20, (21, 3, unknown)>
    - Node 21: <21, (20, 14, 8)>
    - Node 22: <22, (5, 17, 15)>
    - Node 23: <23, (5, 13, 7)>
    - Node 24: <24, (22, 1, 18)>
    - Node 25: <25, (2, 16, 10)>
    - Node 26: <26, (16, 12, unknown)>
    - Node 27: <27, (8, 28, unknown)>
    - Node 28: <28, (27, 17, 23)>
    - Node 29: <29, (2, 4, unknown)>

2. Count the total unique 3-stars: [31]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].
