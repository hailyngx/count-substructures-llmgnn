Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

The graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three other nodes connected to it, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 edges originating from them.

Checking the adjacency list, we find the following nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 10, 11, and 15
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 5, 16, and 13

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph.

[2]

Unique 3-stars:
<7, (10, 11, 15)>
<13, (5, 13, 16)>
