Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all the unique 3-stars first.

1. From the adjacency list:
- 3-star with center node 1: <1, (6, 8, 7)>
- 3-star with center node 2: <2, (6, 9, 5)>
- 3-star with center node 3: <3, (9, 4, 7)>
- 3-star with center node 4: <4, (9, 0, 5)>
- 3-star with center node 5: <5, (4, 2, 3)>
- 3-star with center node 6: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- 3-star with center node 7: <7, (5, 3, 1)>
- 3-star with center node 8: <8, (6, 3, 1)>
- 3-star with center node 9: <9, (4, 2, 3)>

By listing out the unique 3-stars above, we observe that <9, (4, 2, 3)> is repeated because node 9 is a common leaf in two different 3-stars. We should count this 3-star only once.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
