Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 11, 10, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 13, 4, 2, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 13, 4, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 11, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 11, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 13, 4, 14, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 2, 0, 12, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 10, 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<8, (13, 2, 0)>
<13, (2, 6, 1)>
<4, (1, 6, 2)>
<5, (2, 11, 14)>
<6, (13, 4, 14)>
<2, (8, 13, 5)>
<3, (13, 11, 7)>
<11, (5, 3, 0)>
<0, (8, 11, 10)>
<10, (5, 0, 9)>
<7, (8, 3, 14)>
<1, (13, 4, 12)>
<14, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 10, 14)>
<12, (8, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
