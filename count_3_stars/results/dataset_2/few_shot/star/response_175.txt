Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph and find all the 3-star structures:

1. <0, (5, 9, 4)>  
2. <1, (6, 3, 0)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 0)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 1)>
5. <4, (9, 7, 0)>
6. <5, (6, 8, 0)>
7. <6, (5, 1, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 9, 6)>
9. <8, (5, 1, 0)>
10. <9, (4, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
