Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 3)>
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 9, 4)>
4. Node 4: <4, (5, 1, 8)>
5. Node 8: <8, (9, 3, 7)>
6. Node 9: <9, (8, 2, 1)>

Since we have identified 6 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
