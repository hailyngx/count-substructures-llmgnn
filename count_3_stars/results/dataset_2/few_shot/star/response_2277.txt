Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 connections. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

    - Nodes with 3 connections: 7

2. For each of these nodes, check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by verifying that the neighbors are not connected to each other. 

    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, so 7 is not a center node of a 3-star.

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
