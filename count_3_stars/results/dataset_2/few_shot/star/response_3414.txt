Response:
Firstly, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with the central node, we will look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
- For node 0, the 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 12, 3)> and <0, (6, 12, 7)>

- For node 1, the 3-star is:
<1, (4, 2, 3)>

- For node 2, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes.

- For node 3, the 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 10, 0)> and <3, (2, 10, 4)>

- For node 4, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than three other nodes.

- For node 5, the 3-star is:
<5, (9, 8, 11)>

- For node 6, the 3-star is:
<6, (12, 13, 0)>

- For node 7, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than three other nodes.

- For node 8, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes.

- For node 9, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than three other nodes.

- For node 10, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than three other nodes.

- For node 11, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes.

- For node 12, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to only two other nodes.

- For node 13, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than three other nodes.

- For node 14, there are no 3-stars as it is connected to only one other node.

Count of 3-stars: [7] 
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 12, 3)>, <0, (6, 12, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 3)>, <3, (4, 10, 0)>, <3, (2, 10, 4)>, <5, (9, 8, 11)>, <6, (12, 13, 0)>
