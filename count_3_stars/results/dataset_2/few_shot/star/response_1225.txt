Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations based on the given edges. Let's start finding the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 7, 18)>
- <0, (15, 7, 18)>

2. For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 17, 0)>

3. For Node 2:
- <2, (9, 11, 18)>
- <2, (9, 11, 6)>
- <2, (9, 18, 10)>

4. For Node 3:
- <3, (11, 14, 19)>

5. For Node 5:
- <5, (9, 7, 17)>
- <5, (9, 7, 16)>
- <5, (9, 16, 17)>
- <5, (7, 16, 17)>

6. For Node 9:
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <9, (5, 8, 9)>

7. For Node 16:
- <16, (5, 17, 16)>
- <16, (5, 17, 12)>
- <16, (5, 17, 19)>
- <16, (5, 12, 19)>
- <16, (12, 13, 16)>
- <16, (12, 13, 19)>

8. For Node 18:
- <18, (2, 10, 6)>
- <18, (2, 10, 0)>

9. For Node 19:
- <19, (3, 8, 13)>
- <19, (3, 8, 16)>
- <19, (3, 8, 19)>
