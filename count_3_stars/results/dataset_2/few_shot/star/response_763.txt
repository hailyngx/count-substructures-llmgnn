Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by finding the number of 3-stars around each node. Since a 3-star involves the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify each unique set of a central node and its three connected nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
[22]

There is only one unique 3-star in this graph, with the central node 22 and its connected nodes being 21, 13, 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

**Note:** It's important to carefully analyze the network structure and consider all possible combinations of central nodes and their connected neighbors to accurately determine the number of 3-stars.
