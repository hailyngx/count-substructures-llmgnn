Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, 14, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 14, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 10, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 10, 3, 8, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 13, 14, 12, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 11, 0, 4, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 10, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 8, 12, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 10, 0, and node 2

Response:
Starting with Node 6 as the center: 
1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 3. <6, (9, 10, 3)>
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 3. <6, (8, 13, 3)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 3. <6, (8, 10, 3)>

Moving on to Node 9 as the center: 
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 0. <9, (6, 3, 0)>

Now we have found all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
