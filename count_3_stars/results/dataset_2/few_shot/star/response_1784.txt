Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph. The center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then check the neighbors of these potential central nodes to see if they form a 3-star graph configuration.

Potential center nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 21, Node 5, Node 13]
- Node 1: Connected to 4 nodes - [Node 4, Node 14, Node 17, Node 10]
- Node 2: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 11, Node 20, Node 7]
- Node 3: Connected to 5 nodes - [Node 8, Node 11, Node 24, Node 23, Node 22]
- Node 4: Connected to 5 nodes - [Node 27, Node 8, Node 12, Node 23, Node 1]
- Node 5: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 0, Node 28, Node 22]
- Node 6: Connected to 1 node - [Node 20]
- Node 7: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 8, Node 2]
- Node 8: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 4, Node 3, Node 7]
- Node 9: Connected to 1 node - [Node 11]
- Node 10: Connected to 1 node - [Node 1]
- Node 12: Connected to 5 nodes - [Node 15, Node 4, Node 14, Node 17, Node 20]
- Node 13: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 0, Node 16]
- Node 14: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 1, Node 12]
- Node 15: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 27, Node 12]
- Node 16: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 27, Node 13, Node 21]
- Node 17: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 29, Node 1, Node 12]
- Node 18: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 11, Node 26, Node 19]
- Node 19: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 29, Node 18, Node 20]
- Node 20: Connected to 5 nodes - [Node 26, Node 2, Node 19, Node 12, Node 6]
- Node 21: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 0, Node 16]
- Node 22: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 3, Node 11, Node 5]
- Node 23: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 4, Node 3, Node 25]
- Node 24: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 3, Node 28, Node 25]
- Node 25: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 27, Node 23, Node 24]
- Node 26: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 18, Node 28, Node 20]
- Node 27: Connected to 4 nodes - [Node 15, Node 4, Node 25, Node 16]
- Node 28: Connected to 3 nodes - [Node 26, Node 24, Node 5]
- Node 29: Connected to 2 nodes - [Node 17, Node 19]

After checking the neighbors of the potential center nodes, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <0, (21, 5, 13)>
- <1, (4, 14, 17)>
- <11, (3, 22, 9)>
- <12, (15, 14, 17)>
- <16, (27, 13, 21)>
- <19, (29, 18, 20)>
- <20, (26, 19, 12)>
- <21, (0, 16, 27)>
- <23, (4, 3, 25)>
- <24, (3, 28, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
