Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The possible 3-stars can be formed using the central node and its neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node: 

- Node 0 has no 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 11, and 14.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 12.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 14, 11, and 12.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 3, and 11.
- Node 7 has no 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 12, and 14.
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 11.
- Node 10 has no 3-stars.
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 6, and 5.
- Node 12 forms 3-stars with nodes 8, 3, and 7.
- Node 13 has no 3-stars.
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, and 8.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us the following result:

<1, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (9, 11, 14)>, <3, (1, 4, 12)>, <4, (9, 3, 6)>, <5, (14, 11, 12)>, <6, (4, 3, 11)>, <8, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (1, 4, 11)>, <11, (9, 6, 5)>, <14, (2, 5, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
