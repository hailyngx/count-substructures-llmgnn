Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first understand the definition of a 3-star graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Analyzing the given adjacency list, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the given graph: 

<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<4, (14, 13, 9)>
<5, (6, 12, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 3)>
<8, (10, 0, 12)>
<12, (1, 5, 14)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
