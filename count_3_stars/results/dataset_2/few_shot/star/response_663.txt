Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given edges and adjacency list:

1. For each node in the graph, we look for nodes that are connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.
2. We then list all unique 3-star patterns <center_node, (leaf_node1, leaf_node2, leaf_node3)>.

Here are the 3-star patterns found:
<0, (2, 7, 12)>
<1, (5, 10, 15)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (17, 10, unconnected)>
<4, (13, 1, unconnected)>
<5, (2, 19, 12)>
<6, (9, 17, 13)>
<7, (9, 18, 0)>
<8, (10, 3, unconnected)>
<9, (6, 18, 7)>
<10, (8, 3, 1)>
<11, (16, 15, unconnected)>
<12, (8, 13, 0)>
<13, (16, 6, 12)>
<15, (11, 1, 12)>
<16, (11, 0, 13)>
<17, (6, 18, 3)>
<18, (9, 7, 17)>
<19, (9, 5, unconnected)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
