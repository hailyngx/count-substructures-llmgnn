Response:
The center node which is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges forms a 3-star. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that these are the possible 3-stars:
<0, (14, 7, 13)>
<1, (17, 7, 16)>
<2, (10, 28, 6)>
<3, (5, 20, 18)>
<7, (5, 0, 12)>
<8, (9, 22, 20)>
<9, (26, 8, 11)>
<12, (15, 7, 19)>
<15, (25, 12, 28)>
<16, (1, 28, 27)>
<18, (10, 11, 3)>
<19, (12, 3, 27)>
<20, (3, 8, 28)>
<21, (23, 14, 8)>
<24, (17, 27, 29)>
<25, (15, 6, 2)>
<26, (9, 13, 26)>
<27, (10, 16, 19)>
<28, (15, 20, 16)>
<29, (7, 6, 24)>

There are a total of 20 unique 3-star configurations listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
