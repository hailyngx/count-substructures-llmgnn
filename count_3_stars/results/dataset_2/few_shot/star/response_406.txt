Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph structure.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-stars
- Node 1: <1, (9, 2, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (8, 1, 10)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 5: <5, (6, 1, 10)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 3)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: <8, (4, 2, 10)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 14, 1)>
- Node 10: No 3-stars
- Node 11: No 3-stars
- Node 12: No 3-stars
- Node 13: No 3-stars
- Node 14: No 3-stars

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (9, 2, 11)>, <2, (8, 1, 10)>, <4, (8, 13, 14)>, <5, (6, 1, 10)>, and <6, (9, 5, 3)>.
