Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly three connections are:
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 7 and 11.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 14, and 12.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 4 and 11.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 4, 2, and 14.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (7, 11)>
<9, (8, 14, 12)>
<10, (4, 11)>
<12, (4, 2, 14)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [4]
