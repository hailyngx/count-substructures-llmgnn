Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, it might be easier to first identify all the potential 3-stars and then remove any duplicates.

Given the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes have the following connections:

- Node 0: 9, 3
- Node 1: 3, 10, 13, 4, 12
- Node 2: 4, 7, 10
- Node 3: 1, 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 10, 2
- Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 12, 11
- Node 6: 5, 10
- Node 7: 8, 13, 11, 2
- Node 8: 5, 13, 4, 14, 7
- Node 9: 5, 11, 14, 10, 13, 0
- Node 10: 9, 1, 4, 6, 2
- Node 11: 5, 9, 14, 7, 12
- Node 12: 5, 1, 11
- Node 13: 9, 1, 8, 7
- Node 14: 9, 8, 11

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (9, 3, x)>
<1, (3, 10, 12)>
<2, (4, 7, 10)>
<3, (1, 0, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 10, x)>
<7, (8, 13, 11)>
<8, (5, 13, 4)>
<9, (5, 11, 14)>
<10, (9, 1, 4)>
<11, (5, 9, 14)>
<12, (5, 1, 11)>
<13, (9, 1, 8)>
<14, (9, 8, 11)>

Therefore, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (9, 3, x)> <1, (3, 10, 12)> <2, (4, 7, 10)> <3, (1, 0, 4)> <4, (1, 3, 8)> <5, (9, 6, 8)> <6, (5, 10, x)> <7, (8, 13, 11)> <8, (5, 13, 4)> <9, (5, 11, 14)> <10, (9, 1, 4)> <11, (5, 9, 14)> <12, (5, 1, 11)> <13, (9, 1, 8)> <14, (9, 8, 11)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
