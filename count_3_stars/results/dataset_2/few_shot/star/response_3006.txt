Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go through the graph and find these 3-star patterns.

In this graph, we find the following 3-star patterns:

<3, (15, 7, 23)>
<15, (3, 6, 16)>
<4, (7, 18, 14)>
<5, (9, 6, 23)>
<9, (5, 8, 25)>
<6, (15, 5, 18)>
<7, (3, 4, 14)>
<8, (9, 29, 26)>
<16, (15, 10, 0)>
<18, (4, 6, 19)>
<19, (18, 2, 17)>
<21, (20, 12, 22)>
<22, (21, 0, 25)>
<23, (3, 5, 14)>
<24, (9, 21, 17)>
<25, (9, 1, 22)>
<29, (8, 20, 1)>

From the identified 3-star patterns, we can see that each node with exactly three neighbors is part of a unique 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the same as the number of unique 3-star patterns above.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (15, 7, 23)>
<15, (3, 6, 16)>
<4, (7, 18, 14)>
<5, (9, 6, 23)>
<9, (5, 8, 25)>
<6, (15, 5, 18)>
<7, (3, 4, 14)>
<8, (9, 29, 26)>
<16, (15, 10, 0)>
<18, (4, 6, 19)>
<19, (18, 2, 17)>
<21, (20, 12, 22)>
<22, (21, 0, 25)>
<23, (3, 5, 14)>
<24, (9, 21, 17)>
<25, (9, 1, 22)>
<29, (8, 20, 1)>
