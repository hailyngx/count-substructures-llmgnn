Response:
First, let's find the nodes which are part of a 3-star. A 3-star will have a central node and three leaf nodes connected to it. 

For each node, we can consider it as the central node and the nodes connected to it as leaf nodes. Then, we need to check if these leaf nodes are connected to each other. If they are, then we have found a 3-star with the current node as the center.

Let's check each node following the approach mentioned above:

1. Node 0: <0, (19, 9, 10)> - Not a 3-star as 19 and 10 are not directly connected.
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 16)> - Not a 3-star as 3, 6, and 16 are not directly connected.
3. Node 2: <2, (8, 13, 17)> - Not a 3-star as 8 and 13 are not directly connected.
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 18, X)> - Not a 3-star as 1 and 18 are connected to node 3 but not to each other.
5. Node 4: <4, (8, 18, X)> - Not a 3-star as 8 and 18 are connected to node 4 but not to each other.
6. Node 5: <5, (15, X, 10)> - Not a 3-star as 15 and 10 are not directly connected.
7. Node 6: <6, (1, X, 16)> - Not a 3-star as 1 and 16 are not directly connected.
8. Node 7: <7, (18, X, 17)> - Not a 3-star as 18 and 17 are not directly connected.
9. Node 8: <8, (4, 2, 9)> - This is a 3-star. Leaf nodes 4, 2, and 9 are directly connected to each other.
10. Node 9: <9, (8, 19, 11)> - This is a 3-star. Leaf nodes 8, 19, and 11 are directly connected to each other.
11. Node 10: <10, (5, 0, 13)> - Not a 3-star as 5 and 13 are not directly connected.
12. Node 11: <11, (18, 9, 12)> - This is a 3-star. Leaf nodes 18, 9, and 12 are directly connected to each other.
13. Node 12: <12, (1, 0, 15)> - Not a 3-star as 1 and 15 are not directly connected.
14. Node 13: <13, (2, 0, 7)> - Not a 3-star as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
15. Node 14: No 3-star possible as it has only one connection.
16. Node 15: <15, (18, 5, 12)> - Not a 3-star as 18 and 5 are not directly connected.
17. Node 16: <16, (1, 6, X)> - Not a 3-star as 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
18. Node 17: <17, (2, 7, X)> - Not a 3-star as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
19. Node 18: <18, (3, 4, 15)> - This is a 3-star. Leaf nodes 3, 4, and 15 are directly connected to each other.
20. Node 19: <19, (0, 9, X)> - Not a 3-star as 0 and 9 are not directly connected.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (8, 19, 11)>
<18, (3, 4, 15)>
