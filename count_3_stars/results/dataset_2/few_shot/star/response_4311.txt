Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. In this case, we are looking for nodes that are in the center of a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found, we get a total of [8].
