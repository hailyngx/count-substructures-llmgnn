Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes that form 3-stars are those nodes which have exactly 3 edges and are connected to each other through those edges. The center node of the 3-star will be the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided adjacency list:
- Node 1, 25, 2, 8, 18, 19, 26 have more than three edges attached and cannot form a 3-star.
- The following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes and are potential centers for 3-stars: 7, 9, 13, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, or 29.

We will now evaluate each potential center node to find unique 3-stars.

1. Node 7: (7, 22, 23)
2. Node 9: (9, 8, 5) 
3. Node 13: (13, 18, 10)
4. Node 10: (10, 11, 3)
5. Node 11: (11, 15, 0)
6. Node 12: (12, 20, 9)
7. Node 14: (14, 21, *) [Incomplete - Less than 3 leaves]
8. Node 15: (15, 11, 17)
9. Node 17: (17, 22, 7)
10. Node 20: (20, 12, 6)
11. Node 21: (21, 22, 28)
12. Node 22: (22, 7, 17)
13. Node 23: (23, 7, 29)
14. Node 24: (24, 18, 12)
15. Node 27: (27, 4, 5)
16. Node 28: (28, 18, 21)
17. Node 29: (29, 23, 3)

Hence, the unique 3-stars found are:
<<7, (22, 23)>, <9, (8, 5)>, <13, (18, 10)>, <10, (11, 3)>, <11, (15, 0)>, <12, (20, 9)>, <15, (11, 17)>, <17, (22, 7)>, <20, (12, 6)>, <21, (22, 28)>, <22, (7, 17)>, <23, (7, 29)>, <24, (18, 12)>, <27, (4, 5)>, <28, (18, 21)>, <29, (23, 3)>]

Output: [16]
