Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<3, (15, 6, 9)>
<15, (3, 1, 12)>
<6, (3, 5, 13)>
<9, (3, 6, 17)>
<10, (11, 12, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 16, 0)>
<1, (15, 10, 17)>
<4, (11)>
<7, (8, 14, 19)>
<11, (9, 10, 0)>
<0, (8, 11, 13)>
<14, (18, 19, 12)>
<17, (3, 9, 1)>
<18, (19, 14)>
<19, (17, 18, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
