Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

From the given adjacency list, we identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 16, 27)>
<15, (3, 20, 7)>
<27, (3, 0, 4)>
<0, (27, 17, 22)>
<22, (0, 23, 26)>
<20, (15, 1, 29)>
<14, (1, 18, 24)>
<26, (22, 13, 5)>
<13, (26, 12, 25)>
<17, (0, 23, 5)>
<18, (27, 14, 6)>
<12, (22, 13, 19)>
<7, (15, 25, 10)>
<5, (0, 26, 17)>
<10, (26, 25, 6)>
<9, (28, 29, 20)>
<16, (3, 13, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 16 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
