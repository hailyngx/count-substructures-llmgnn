Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

From the adjacency list:
- Node 5 is connected to 6, 17, and 10
- Node 12 is connected to 22, 16, and 14
- Node 29 is connected to 23, 4, and 25

So, we have identified three unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 17, 10)>
<12, (22, 16, 14)>
<29, (23, 4, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
