Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 19) (2, 0) (2, 16)

Response:
Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we can count the number of unique 3-stars by examining each node and its neighbors to see if a 3-star pattern is formed.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<5, (8, 17, 0)>
<10, (11, 15, 4)>
<11, (10, 19, 13)>
<8, (5, 16, 12)>
<13, (11, 16, 3)>
<4, (10, 18, 6)>
<18, (4, 19, 14)>
<1, (5, 7, -)>
<17, (5, 15, 12)>
<3, (13, 18, 0)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (1, 0, 15)>
<16, (8, 13, 2)>
<6, (4, 19, -)>
<12, (8, 17, -)>
<14, (18, 15, 19)>
<2, (0, 16, -)>

There are no 3-stars for node 9 since it is not connected to any other nodes.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [16]. 

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [16].
