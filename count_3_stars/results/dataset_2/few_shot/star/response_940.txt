Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list the unique 3-stars found. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 5, 12)>
<3, (15, 8, 13)>
<3, (5, 15, 18)>
<3, (8, 15, 13)>
<2, (6, 17, 2)>
<12, (17, 7, 19)>
<13, (15, 9, 8)>
<13, (9, 18, 1)>
<13, (0, 14, 18)>
<0, (14, 13, 10)>
<1, (9, 18, 11)>
<1, (18, 16, 14)>
<1, (11, 7, 4)>
<16, (14, 10, 18)>
<16, (10, 0, 16)>
<16, (18, 1, 14)>
<17, (12, 7, 11)>
<4, (11, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
