Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Here are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 4, 6, 3)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 11, 16, 5)
- Node 14 (connected to node 13)

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (11, 16, 5)>
<14, (13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
