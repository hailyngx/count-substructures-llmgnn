Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors since these nodes can act as the center of a 3-star:

   Nodes with 3 neighbors: 12, 1
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors:

   Node 12:
   - (12, 0, 13, 14) is a 3-star with 12 as the center
   - (12, 1, 13) is a 3-star with 12 as the center

   Node 1:
   - (1, 6, 12) is a 3-star with 1 as the center

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:

   Unique 3-stars:
   <12, (0, 13, 14)>
   <12, (1, 13)>
   <1, (6, 12)>

   [3-stars: 3]
