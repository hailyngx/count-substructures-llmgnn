Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given adjacency list, we can see the connections of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to 8, 2, 10, 1, 6
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 9, 13, 0
- Node 2 is connected to 8, 6, 3, 0
- Node 3 is connected to 2, 14, 6
- Node 4 is connected to 5, 8, 13
- Node 5 is connected to 9, 1, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to 12, 2, 0, 11, 3
- Node 7 is connected to 5, 9, 12
- Node 8 is connected to 13, 4, 2, 10, 0
- Node 9 is connected to 5, 11, 10, 1, 7
- Node 10 is connected to 9, 8, 13, 0, 14
- Node 11 is connected to 9, 14, 6
- Node 12 is connected to 7, 14, 6
- Node 13 is connected to 8, 4, 1, 10
- Node 14 is connected to 12, 10, 11, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (8, 2, 6)>
2. <0, (8, 10, 1)>
3. <0, (2, 8, 6)>
4. <0, (2, 6, 3)>
5. <1, (5, 9, 13)>
6. <2, (8, 6, 3)>
7. <3, (2, 14, 6)>
8. <4, (5, 8, 13)>
9. <5, (9, 1, 4)>
10. <6, (12, 2, 0)>
11. <7, (5, 9, 12)>
12. <8, (13, 4, 10)>
13. <9, (5, 11, 10)>
14. <10, (9, 8, 13)>
15. <11, (9, 14, 6)>
16. <12, (7, 14, 6)>
17. <13, (8, 4, 1)>
18. <14, (12, 10, 11)>
