Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for every possible combination where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars we can find:

<0, (13, 10, 19)>
<1, (15, 4, 7)>
<2, (8, 14, 19)>
<3, (13, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 18, 16)>
<5, (9, 6, 10)>
<6, (5, 15, 0)>
<7, (1, 18, 11)>
<8, (2, 14, 19)>
<9, (5, 14, 16)>
<10, (5, 0, 15)>
<11, (14, 7, 0)>
<13, (9, 3, 0)>
<14, (9, 17, 11)>
<15, (1, 6, 10)>
<16, (9, 4, 10)>
<17, (14, 15, 18)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
<19, (0, 2, 8)>

There are total of [19] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
