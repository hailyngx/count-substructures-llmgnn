Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern (center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes).

In this graph, the nodes that form 3-stars are: 5, 9, 10, 11, 15, 18, and 19.

Step 2: Identify all unique 3-stars.

<5, (19, 18, 1)>
<9, (11, 16, 15)>
<10, (19, 7, 14)>
<11, (9, 8, 4)>
<15, (5, 9, 17)>
<18, (16, 5, 14)>
<19, (5, 17, 10)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
