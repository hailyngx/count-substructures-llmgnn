Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in the specific pattern required for a 3-star (center node connected to exactly three other nodes). 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph and then count them.

<1, (3, 16, 7)>
<3, (1, 17, 13)>
<4, (0, 14, 19)>
<7, (5, 9, 17)>
<8, (15, 16, 19)>
<9, (15, 7, 12)>
<10, (0, 16, 12)>
<12, (9, 8, 18)>
<13, (3, 10, 18)>
<14, (4, 15, 2)>
<16, (1, 8, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [11].
