Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the central node of each potential 3-star.
2. Then, we check if the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. If yes, we have found a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 14)> (a 3-star found)
- Node 2: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 11)> (a 3-star found)
- Node 6: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 8: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 13)> (a 3-star found)
- Node 10: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 11: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 12: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 13: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 14: Not a central node of a 3-star.

So, we found 3 unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 7, 14)>, <5, (9, 6, 11)>, and <9, (5, 8, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
