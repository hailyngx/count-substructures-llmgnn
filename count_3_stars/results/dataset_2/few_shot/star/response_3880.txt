Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

<4, (8, 5, 2)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (8, 1, 5)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
