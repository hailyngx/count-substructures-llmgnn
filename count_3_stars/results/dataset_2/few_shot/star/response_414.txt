Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. We shall determine the 3-stars by identifying the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them (excluding the center of the star). 

Based on the information provided:
- Node 5, 9, and 6 are nodes with 3 edges connected to them, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's find the specific 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 5:
- <5, (9, 2, 4)>  
- <5, (9, 0, 3)>  
- <5, (9, 7, 5)>  

For Node 9:
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>  
- <9, (5, 1, 0)>  
- <9, (6, 7, 5)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (9, 7, 1)>  
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>  
- <6, (7, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
