Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node. Given the adjacency list provided, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (7, 0, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
