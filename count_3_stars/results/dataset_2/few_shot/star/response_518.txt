Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (8, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
