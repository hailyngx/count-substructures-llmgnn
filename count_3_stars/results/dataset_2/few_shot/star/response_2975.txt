Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
To have a 3-star in the graph, a node needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. We will search for such configurations in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and 5. <1, (4, 6, 5)>
2. Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and 12. <2, (4, 7, 12)>
3. Node 5 is connected to node 1, 13, and 6. <5, (1, 13, 6)>
4. Node 6 is connected to node 1, 13, and 5. <6, (1, 13, 5)>
5. Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, and 14. <8, (1, 13, 14)>
6. Node 9 is connected to node 13, 12, and 14. <9, (13, 12, 14)>
7. Node 14 is connected to node 1, 8, and 2. <14, (1, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
