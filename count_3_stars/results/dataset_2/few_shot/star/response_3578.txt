Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0)

Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes in a 3-star graph are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. From the given adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1 and 6 have 1 neighbor each, so they cannot be central nodes. 

The remaining nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Among these, the central nodes are 5, 8, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph with centers at nodes 5, 8, and 9.

For Node 5: 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8. Hence, the unique 3-star centered at Node 5 is <5, (9, 2, 8)>.

For Node 8: 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3. Hence, the unique 3-star centered at Node 8 is <8, (5, 9, 3)>.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 4. Hence, the unique 3-star centered at Node 9 is <9, (5, 8, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
