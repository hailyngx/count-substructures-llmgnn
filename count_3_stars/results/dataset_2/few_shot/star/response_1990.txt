Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that have 3 edges connected to them:
   - Node 8 has edges to nodes 13, 9, and 16.
   - Node 3 has edges to nodes 8, 28, and 20.
   - Node 5 has edges to nodes 22, 28, and 24.
   - Node 15 has edges to nodes 10, 12, and 28.

2. Form unique 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
   - <8, (13, 9, 16)>
   - <3, (8, 28, 20)>
   - <5, (22, 28, 24)>
   - <15, (10, 12, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
