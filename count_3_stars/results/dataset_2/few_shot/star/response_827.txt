Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the following potential 3-stars: 
<0, (13, 10, 2)>
<1, (6, 9, 10)>
<2, (7, 10, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 14)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (4, 3, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<7, (6, 4, 12)>
<8, (9, 13, 11)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<10, (11, 0, 1)>
<11, (8, 13, 10)>
<12, (7, 11)>
<13, (9, 8, 11)>
<14, (6, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [14] unique 3-stars in the graph.
