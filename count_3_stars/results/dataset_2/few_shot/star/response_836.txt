Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 0

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

First, let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
