Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
There are <0, (6, 9, 8)> and <3, (9, 4, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
