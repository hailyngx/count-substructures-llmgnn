Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-star can be formed with the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Counting the 3-stars:

1. <5, (9, 8, 3)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 3)>
3. <3, (5, 9, 1)>
4. <8, (5, 9, 4)>
5. <0, (9, 8, 7)>
6. <1, (3, 2, 8)>
7. <2, (5, 1, 7)>

So, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
