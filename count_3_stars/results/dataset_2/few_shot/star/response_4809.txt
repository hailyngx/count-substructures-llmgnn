Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to see if it forms a 3-star.

Checking Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 8. (0, 9, 1, 8) doesn't form a 3-star.

Checking Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 0. (1, 5, 9, 4) is a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, and 0. (1, 5, 4, 3) is a 3-star.

Checking Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3. (2, 5, 9, 3) doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 6. (2, 5, 3, 6) is a 3-star.

Checking Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6. (3, 7, 1, 6) doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 2. (3, 1, 6, 2) doesn't form a 3-star.

Checking Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. (4, 5, 7, 8) is a 3-star.

Checking Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 1, and 4. (5, 2, 1, 4) is a 3-star.

Checking Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 8. (6, 7, 3, 8) doesn't form a 3-star.

Checking Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 6. (7, 5, 9, 4) is a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, and 6. (7, 5, 4, 3) is a 3-star.

Checking Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 6. (8, 4, 0, 6) doesn't form a 3-star.

Checking Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, and 7. (9, 2, 1, 7) is a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>

There are total [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
