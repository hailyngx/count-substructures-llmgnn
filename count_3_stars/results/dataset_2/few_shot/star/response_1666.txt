Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 4, 13, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 14, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 14, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 11, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 1, 6, 2, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 11, 12, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 10, 7, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 8, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 12, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 3, 10), (5, 4, 11), (5, 9, 10)
2. Node 4: (4, 0, 8)
3. Node 0: (0, 4, 6)
4. Node 1: (1, 10, 7)
5. Node 2: (2, 6, 7)
6. Node 3: (3, 5, 13)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (3, 10, 5)>
<5, (4, 11, 5)>
<5, (9, 10, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 4)>
<0, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (7, 10, 1)>
<2, (6, 7, 2)>
<3, (5, 13, 3)>
