Response:
Let's find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. We need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of a 3-star.
2. Check each node in the graph. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we have found a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Now, let's find the 3-star graphs:

- From the adjacency list, we observe that the possible 3-star centers are nodes: 5, 4, 1, and 18.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<4, (9, 17, 15)>
<1, (11, 19, 8)>
<18, (10, 11, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
