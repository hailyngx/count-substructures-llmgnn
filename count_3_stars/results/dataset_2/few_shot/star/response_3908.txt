Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all possible instances of 3-stars based on the given edges and node connections.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (15, 17, 8)>
<0, (15, 6, 13)>
<0, (8, 6, 13)>
<1, (10, 16, 6)>
<1, (10, 16, 18)>
<1, (10, 6, 18)>
<3, (15, 14, 5)>
<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<3, (14, 5, 18)>
<4, (15, 17, 9)>
<4, (15, 9, 4)>
<4, (17, 9, 4)>
<5, (3, 2, 19)>
<5, (3, 11, 16)>
<5, (2, 19, 11)>
<6, (17, 8, 1)>
<6, (17, 8, 0)>
<6, (17, 1, 18)>
<9, (19, 5, 11)>
<9, (19, 11, 5)>
<9, (19, 11, 16)>
<16, (5, 1, 18)>
<16, (5, 18, 16)>
<16, (1, 18, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [23].
