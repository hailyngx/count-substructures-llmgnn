Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Remove all nodes with less than 3 edges.  
New adjacency list after removing nodes 0 and 4:  
- Node 1: 9, 3, 5, 8  
- Node 2: 6, 9, 3, 7  
- Node 3: 1, 7, 2, 5  
- Node 5: 6, 1, 3  
- Node 6: 9, 5, 7, 2  
- Node 7: 6, 9, 3, 2  

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars.  
- <2, (6, 9, 7)>  
- <6, (2, 9, 7)>  
- <9, (6, 8, 7)>  
- <1, (9, 5, 8)>  
- <3, (1, 7, 2)>  

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars. [5]  

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
