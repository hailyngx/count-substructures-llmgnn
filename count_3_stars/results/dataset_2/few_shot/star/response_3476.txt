Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, 3
   This forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 1, 3)>

2. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 2
   This forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 2)>

3. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 1
   This forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 8, 1)>

4. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 0
   This forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 8, 0)>

5. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, 8
   This forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 4, 8)>

6. Node 5 could potentially form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 0
   This forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 0)>

7. Node 9 could potentially form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 2, 3
   This forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we have:
