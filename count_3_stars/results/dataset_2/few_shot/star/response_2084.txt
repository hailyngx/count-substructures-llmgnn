Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 10, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 11, 10, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 10, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 13, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 13, 11, 12, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 14, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 0, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 3, 5, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 9, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three leaves for each 3-star in the graph. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (10, 11, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 10)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 13)>
<9, (6, 10, 14)>
<10, (0, 3, 6)>
<11, (0, 3, 8)>
<12, (1, 5, 14)>
<13, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer, within brackets, is [11].
