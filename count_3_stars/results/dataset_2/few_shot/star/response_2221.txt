Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 12, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 12, 10, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 12, 1, 11, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 1, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 0, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 13, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 10, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 3, 9, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, 2, 5, 14, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 5, 12, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 12, 6, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (12, 0, 11)>
<12, (7, 13, 0)>
<2, (13, 12, 0)>
<5, (13, 12, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 0)>
<6, (11, 1, 14)>
<3, (5, 11, 0)>
<10, (2, 9, 14)>
<14, (12, 6, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
