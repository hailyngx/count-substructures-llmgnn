Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph can be listed as follows:
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 7, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (6, 7, 5)>
<9, (4, 1, 0)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
