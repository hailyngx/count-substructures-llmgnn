Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 2)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
