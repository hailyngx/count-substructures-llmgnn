Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 10, 18)>
<2, (17, 11, 1)>
<3, (15, 10, 1)>
<4, (0, 16, 19)>
<5, (9, 13, 0)>
<6, (10, 16, 0)>
<7, (5, 14, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 19)>
<9, (5, 17, 18)>
<10, (1, 3, 6)>
<11, (14, 2, 10)>
<12, (15, 19, 5)>
<13, (5, 19, 17)>
<14, (11, 7, 15)>
<15, (14, 12, 3)>
<16, (4, 6, 0)>
<17, (9, 19, 2)>
<18, (1, 9, 19)>
<19, (17, 18, 4)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
