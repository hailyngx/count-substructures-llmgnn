Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes that fit this criterion are: 
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 10, 1, and 9)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 11, 12, and 18)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 14, 19, and 17)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 3, 18, and 17)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 15, 10, and 8)

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (10, 1, 9)>
<10, (11, 12, 18)>
<4, (14, 19, 17)>
<15, (3, 18, 17)>
<18, (15, 10, 8)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have [5].
