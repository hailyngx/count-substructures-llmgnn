Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and then identify the 3-stars centered at those nodes. 

Here are the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 14

Let's now identify the 3-stars centered around these nodes:
- Node 0: <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- Node 1: <1, (8, 2, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (7, 11, 12)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 14: <14, (11, 13, 0)>

There is only one unique 3-star centered around each of these nodes. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
