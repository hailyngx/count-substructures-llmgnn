Response:
Before we start counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph: 
<0, (7, 1, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (10, 8, 12)>
<3, (5, 1, 11)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 10, 11)>
<7, (5, 0, 13)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<10, (1, 11, 6)>
<11, (1, 3, 10)>
<12, (3, 8, 2)>
<13, (9, 7, 3)>
<14, (6, 0, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
