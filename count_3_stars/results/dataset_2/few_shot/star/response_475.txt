Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 2, 4)>
<7, (9, 3, 4)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
