Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 0, 1, and 3. This forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 7, 3)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 8, 0, and 2. This forms two 3-stars: <3, (9, 6, 4)> and <3, (8, 0, 2)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, and 3. This forms two 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 3)> and <4, (8, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 8, and 0. This forms a 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 2, and 1. This forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, and 3. This forms two 3-stars: <8, (9, 6, 4)> and <8, (3, 6, 4)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 2, and 3. This forms two 3-stars: <9, (8, 4, 3)> and <9, (2, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
