Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Starting from each node, we will look for 3-stars where the node is the central node and has exactly three neighbors.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 2)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 11, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (10, 13, 0)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 4, 7)>
5. Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (5, 12, 13)> and <4, (5, 3, 10)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 13, 8)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 10, 0)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 8)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 11)>
10. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (6, 4, 11)>
11. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 1, 8)>
12. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (4, 1, 13)>
13. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (5, 2, 3)>
14. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (9, 10, 3)>

Therefore, there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
