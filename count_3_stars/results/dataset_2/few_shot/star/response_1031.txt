Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 16, 10, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 16, and 17.

2. For each potential center node, check if the three connected nodes form a 3-star.

Observations:
- For Node 1 with connected nodes 17, 16, 10: (1, 17, 16, 10) does not form a 3-star since node 17 and node 16 are not mutually connected.
- For Node 1 with connected nodes 17, 16, 12: (1, 17, 16, 12) does not form a 3-star since node 12 is not mutually connected with the other nodes.

No 3-stars found for Node 1.

Observations:
- For Node 4 with connected nodes 7, 16, 17: (4, 7, 16, 17) forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 7, 16, and 17 as the leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-star found: <<4, (7, 16, 17)>>
