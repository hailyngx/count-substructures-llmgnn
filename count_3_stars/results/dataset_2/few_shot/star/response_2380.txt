Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, and 8:
   - 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, and 2:
   - 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 0, and 6:
   - 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 1, 9)>

So, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
