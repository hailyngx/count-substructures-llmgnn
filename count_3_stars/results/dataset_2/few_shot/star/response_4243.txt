Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

By analyzing the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0: connected to 1, 3, 2
- Node 1: connected to 3, 2, 0
- Node 4: connected to 6, 9, 5
- Node 5: connected to 3, 4, 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph: 
<0, (1, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 0)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we have a total of [4].
