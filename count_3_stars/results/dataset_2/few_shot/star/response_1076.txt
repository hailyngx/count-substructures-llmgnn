Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-star graphs we can find in this graph:

<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<5, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph [10].
