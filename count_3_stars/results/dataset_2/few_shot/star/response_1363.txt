Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. 

Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to 3 other nodes but not in a 3-star configuration. 
Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 5)>
Node 2 does not form any 3-star.
Node 3 forms three 3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, and <3, (7, 1, 5)>
Node 4 does not form any 3-star.
Node 5 does not form any 3-star.
Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
Node 8 does not form any 3-star.
Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
