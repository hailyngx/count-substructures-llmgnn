Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node one by one to find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 connects to nodes 9, 4, 2, and 7. Since it is connected to 4 nodes, it does not form any 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 connects to nodes 5 and 4. Since it is connected to only 2 nodes, it does not form any 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 connects to nodes 5, 4, 8, 0, and 3. Since it is connected to 5 nodes, it does not form any 3-stars.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 connects to nodes 9, 6, 4, and 2. One of the connections forms a 3-star <3, (9, 6, 4)>.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 connects to nodes 8, 0, 1, 3, and 2. Since it is connected to 5 nodes, it does not form any 3-stars.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 connects to nodes 6, 2, and 1. One of the connections forms a 3-star <5, (6, 2, 1)>.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 connects to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 3. One of the connections forms a 3-star <6, (5, 9, 7)>.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 connects to nodes 5, 9, 6, and 0. One of the connections forms a 3-star <7, (5, 9, 6)>.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 connects to nodes 9, 4, and 2. One of the connections forms a 3-star <8, (9, 4, 2)>.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 connects to nodes 6, 8, 3, 7, and 0. Since it is connected to 5 nodes, it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<3, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>
