Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible combination where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a "star" pattern. 

From the adjacency list given:
- We can see that Node 0 can form 3-stars with nodes 9, 4, and 2.
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 5, 7, and 3.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 5, 7, and 3.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 5, 4, and 2.
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with nodes 7, 0, and 6.
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with nodes 9, 2, and 1.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 4, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with nodes 9, 4, and 2.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 0.
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 5.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (7, 0, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<8, (0, 6)>
<9, (5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
