Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all the 3-stars.

Node 0:
- <0, (5, 6, 14)>
- <0, (5, 6, 1)>
- <0, (6, 14, 1)>

Node 1:
- <1, (12, 0, 14)>
- <1, (12, 0, 2)>
- <1, (12, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 14, 2)>
- <1, (0, 14, 8)>
- <1, (14, 2, 8)>

Node 2:
- <2, (9, 7, 1)>
- <2, (9, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 1, 8)>

Node 3:
- No 3-stars.

Node 4:
- <4, (12, 10, 13)>
- <4, (14, 11, 10)>

Node 5:
- No 3-stars.

Node 6:
- <6, (5, 9, 10)>
- <6, (6, 9, 12)>
- <6, (9, 12, 4)>

Node 7:
- No 3-stars.

Node 8:
- <8, (5, 9, 7)>
- <8, (5, 9, 1)>
- <8, (9, 7, 1)>

Node 9:
- <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- <9, (6, 8, 14)>
- <9, (8, 2, 14)>

Node 10:
- <10, (6, 12, 14)>
- <10, (12, 4, 10)>
- <10, (4, 11, 13)>

Node 11:
- No 3-stars.

Node 12:
- <12, (6, 4, 10)>
- <12, (4, 11, 10)>
- <12, (11, 3, 13)>

Node 13:
- No 3-stars.

Node 14:
- <14, (9, 0, 1)>
- <14, (0, 1, 4)>
- <14, (1, 4, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 14)>, <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <0, (6, 14, 1)>, <1, (12, 0, 14)>, <1, (12, 0, 2)>, <1, (12, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 14, 2)>, <1, (0, 14, 8)>, <1, (14, 2, 8)>, <2, (9, 7, 1)>, <2, (9, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 1, 8)>, <4, (12, 10, 13)>, <4, (14, 11, 10)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <6, (6, 9, 12)>, <6, (9, 12, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <9, (8, 2, 14)>, <10, (6, 12, 14)>, <10, (12, 4, 10)>, <10, (4, 11, 13)>, <12, (6, 4, 10)>, <12, (4, 11, 10)>, <12, (11, 3, 13)>, <14, (9, 0, 1)>, <14, (0, 1, 4)>, <14, (1, 4, 10)>
