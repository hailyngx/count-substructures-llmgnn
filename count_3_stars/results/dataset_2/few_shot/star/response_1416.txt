Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list and the given edges, we can observe the following 3-stars:

<0, (8, 3, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 0, 3)>
<3, (5, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (6, 2, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
