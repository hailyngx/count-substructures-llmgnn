Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.
2. Count the occurrence of each unique 3-star.
3. Sum up the counts to get the total number of 3-stars.

Let's find the unique 3-stars first:

There are a total of 15 nodes in the graph. To form a 3-star, we need a center node and three leaves.

Based on the given adjacency list and edge connections, the unique 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (5, 3, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (7, 9, 11)>
<3, (13, 14, 5)>
<4, (7, 11, 13)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (11, 14, 2)>
<7, (10, 2, 1)>
<8, (13, 4, 1)>
<9, (12, 2, 5)>
<10, (14, 12, 7)>
<11, (13, 6, 4)>
<12, (10, 6, 9)>
<13, (14, 3, 8)>
<14, (10, 6, 13)>

Now, let's count the occurrences of each unique 3-star:

- Each unique 3-star appears only once in the list above.

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
