Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Based on the adjacency list, the potential central nodes are 5, 9, 11, 14, and 2 since they each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's go through each potential central node to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 5: (5, 9, 18), (5, 9, 11), (5, 9, 14), (5, 18, 13), (5, 11, 12), (5, 14, 4)
2. Node 9: (9, 5, 2), (9, 5, 0), (9, 5, 14), (9, 2, 7), (9, 0, 19)
3. Node 11: (11, 5, 12), (11, 5, 14), (11, 12, 7), (11, 12, 1), (11, 14, 2)
4. Node 14: (14, 5, 4), (14, 5, 19), (14, 5, 2), (14, 4, 8), (14, 19, 8), (14, 2, 7)
5. Node 2: (2, 9, 7), (2, 9, 17), (2, 7, 8), (2, 7, 17), (2, 17, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 18, 13)>, <5, (11, 12, 5)>, <5, (14, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 19)>, <11, (1, 12, 11)>, <11, (2, 14, 11)>, <14, (4, 5, 14)>, <14, (8, 5, 14)>, <14, (7, 2, 14)>, <2, (1, 17, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
