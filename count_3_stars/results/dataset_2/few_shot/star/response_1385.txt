Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 18: (22, 17, 3)
   - Node 26: (28, 6, 3)
   - Node 27: (16, 12, 16)
   - Node 19: (16, 4, 16)
   - Node 14: (16, 23, 16)
   - Node 20: (6, 28, 10)

2. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
   - There are 6 unique instances of 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<18, (22, 17, 3)>
<26, (28, 6, 3)>
<27, (16, 12, 16)>
<19, (16, 4, 16)>
<14, (16, 23, 16)>
<20, (6, 28, 10)>
