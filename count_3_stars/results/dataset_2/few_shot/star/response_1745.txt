Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<15, (25, 29, 24)>
<27, (10, 20, 25)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 10, 1)>
<7, (21, 16, 0)>
<21, (7, 0, 19)>
<20, (27, 25, 0)>
<25, (15, 20, 2)>
<2, (25, 1, 13)>
<18, (26, 23, 14)>
<4, (13, 23, 6)>
<8, (20, 11, 0)>
<6, (5, 24, 23)>
<19, (21, 20, 26)>
<26, (18, 13, 11)>
<13, (2, 4, 26)>
<28, (20, 17, 12)>
<16, (7, 17, 0)>
<24, (15, 6, 12)>
<22, (14, 1, 29)>
<3, (23)>
<11, (8, 26)>
<12, (28, 24, 29)>
<17, (18, 28, 16)>

By counting these unique 3-stars, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [24].
