Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 14, 3)>
<1, (5, 14, 2)>
<2, (8, 14, 12)>
<3, (9, 7, 13)>
<4, (8, 10, 6)>
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<6, (4, 14, 10)>
<9, (5, 11, 3)>
<10, (4, 6, 2)>
<11, (9, 0, 2)>
<12, (5, 13, 2)>
<13, (5, 6, 12)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
