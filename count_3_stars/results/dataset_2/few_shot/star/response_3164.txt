Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-star patterns:
1. <0, (5, 19, 13)>
2. <1, (3, 12, 10)>
3. <2, (3, 8, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 14, 2)>
5. <4, (18, 13, -)> (Note: Node 4 only has two connected nodes in a 3-star)
6. <5, (2, 0, -)> (Note: Node 5 only has two connected nodes in a 3-star)
7. <6, (8, 18, 17)>
8. <7, (8, 2, 18)>
9. <10, (12, 18, 19)>
10. <11, (9, 15, -)> (Note: Node 11 only has two connected nodes in a 3-star)
11. <13, (4, 19, 14)>
12. <14, (3, 16, 15)>
13. <15, (11, 17, 0)>
14. <16, (7, 14, -)> (Note: Node 16 only has two connected nodes in a 3-star)
15. <17, (6, 15, -)> (Note: Node 17 only has two connected nodes in a 3-star)
16. <18, (10, 4, 19)>
17. <19, (10, 18, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [17]
