Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (16, 3, 23)>
<1, (20, 27, 2)>
<4, (8, 17, 20)>
<5, (9, 8, 29)>
<6, (22, 18, 13)>
<11, (16, 19, 12)>
<15, (11, 21, 28)>
<16, (0, 22, 15)>
<18, (6, 13, 19)>
<19, (11, 21, 23)>
<20, (1, 17, 4)>
<22, (16, 21, 10)>
<23, (0, 25, 19)>
<25, (3, 23, 29)>
<26, (20, 29, 26)>
<27, (1, 2, 3)>
<29, (5, 25, 26)>

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
