Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. We need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. We can cross-check this with the given list of edges to confirm our findings.

Based on the given adjacency list and the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 1 has exactly three neighbors: 8, 13, 7
- Node 8 has exactly three neighbors: 13, 14, 15
- Node 13 has exactly three neighbors: 8, 17, 16
- Node 7 has exactly three neighbors: 9, 12, 11
- Node 9 has exactly three neighbors: 5, 6, 11
- Node 12 has exactly three neighbors: 18, 7, 17
- Node 17 has exactly three neighbors: 13, 12, 16
- Node 15 has exactly one neighbor: 8
- Node 5 has exactly two neighbors: 9, 2
- Node 6 has exactly two neighbors: 9, 18
- Node 2 has exactly two neighbors: 5, 18
- Node 3 has exactly two neighbors: 19, 10
- Node 4 has exactly two neighbors: 2, 0
- Node 16 has exactly two neighbors: 6, 13
- Node 18 has exactly two neighbors: 6, 2
- Node 19 has exactly two neighbors: 18, 1
- Node 10 has exactly two neighbors: 2, 0
- Node 0 has exactly two neighbors: 10, 4
- Node 11 has exactly two neighbors: 9, 7
- Node 14 has exactly two neighbors: 8, 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars.
