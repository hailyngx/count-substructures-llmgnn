Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes connected to it.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 17, 13)>
<3, (4, 18, 19)>
<8, (1, 9, 10)>
<12, (13, 17, 14)>
<13, (12, 1, 15)>
<14, (16, 12, 10)>
<17, (12, 1, 9)>
<18, (2, 19, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
