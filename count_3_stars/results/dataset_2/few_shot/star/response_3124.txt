Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each occurrence of a 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (21, 24)>
<1, (20, 23, 6)>
<2, (11, 22, 6)>
<3, (27, 14, 18)>
<4, (15)>
<5, (27, 25, 11)>
<6, (10, 2, 1)>
<7, (16, 29, 1)>
<8, (28, 29)>
<9, (27, 18)>
<10, (27, 17, 6)>
<11, (23, 19, 1)>
<12, (20, 25, 19)>
<13, (16, 6)>
<14, (26, 16, 3)>
<15, (4)>
<16, (7, 13, 19)>
<17, (10, 19, 26)>
<18, (9, 21, 3)>
<19, (17, 11, 16)>
<20, (25, 1, 12)>
<21, (18, 0)>
<22, (10, 2)>
<23, (11, 1)>
<24, (14, 5, 0)>
<25, (20, 5, 12)>
<26, (17, 28, 14)>
<27, (10, 3, 9)>
<28, (8, 26)>
<29, (8, 7, 3)>

There are [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
