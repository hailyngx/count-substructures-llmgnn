Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 7 is connected to node 9, 11, 12, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 14, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 12, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 14, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 11, 2, 5, and node 13

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 6: (1, 3, 0)
- Node 9: (8, 4, 14)
- Node 14: (11, 2, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (1, 3, 0)>
<9, (8, 4, 14)>
<14, (11, 2, 5)>
