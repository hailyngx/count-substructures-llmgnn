Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
