Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 connections (potential centers of stars)
- Node 3, Node 6, Node 9, Node 11, Node 14, and Node 15 have 3 connections.

Step 2: Identify potential 3-star patterns centered at these nodes:

- For Node 3: <3, (15, 11, 6)>
- For Node 6: <6, (3, 9, 7)>
- For Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 19)>
- For Node 11: <11, (3, 6, 4)>
- For Node 14: <14, (18, 7, 8)>
- For Node 15: <15, (3, 7, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars: 6
