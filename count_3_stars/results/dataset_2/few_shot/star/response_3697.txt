Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
