Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Starting with node 0: (0, 5, 6, 7)
2. Moving on to node 1: (1, 4, 9, 7)
3. Heading to node 2: (2, 5, 6, 8)
4. Next, looking at node 3: (3, 2, 4, 8)
5. Moving to node 4: (4, 1, 3, 8)
6. Now let's check node 5: (5, 6, 2, 7)
7. Moving on to node 6: (6, 5, 9, 7)
8. Continuing to node 7: (7, 9, 5, 6)
9. Next, looking at node 8: (8, 9, 3, 4)
10. Finally, checking node 9: (9, 6, 8, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 5, 6)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
