Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with only one neighbor are the potential central nodes for a 3-star. These nodes are: 11, 19, 20, 26.

2. For each potential central node, we check if it's connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we have found a 3-star. The possible 3-stars are:
   - <11, (16, 17, 13)>
   - <19, (21, 9, 28)>
   - <26, (22, 6, 14)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 3. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
