Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<9, (26, 0, 11)>
<9, (26, 27, 19)>
<26, (29, 1, 6)>
<22, (0, 20, 7)>
<12, (20, 17, 1)>
<27, (13, 19, 9)>
<2, (8, 19, 28)>
<8, (2, 28, 19)>
<21, (28, 10, 18)>
<17, (12, 18, 11)>
<29, (1, 6, 24)>
<3, (28, 6, 5)>
<1, (12, 29, 15)>
<5, (3, 11, 4)>
<15, (1, 13, 14)>
<19, (8, 13, 9)>
<16, (7, 4, 6)>
<10, (21, 13, 10)>
<6, (29, 15, 16)>
<4, (5, 24, 16)>
<14, (15, 13, 14)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [21].
