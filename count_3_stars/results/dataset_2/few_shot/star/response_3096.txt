Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated using the concept of counting triangles in a graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph to find the number of 3-stars.

The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the adjacency matrix of the graph. Let A be the adjacency matrix of the graph, where A[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge between nodes i and j, and 0 otherwise. Then, the number of triangles in the graph can be calculated as follows:

Number of triangles = (1/6) * trace(A^3)

Here, A^3 represents the cube of the adjacency matrix A, and trace(A^3) represents the sum of the diagonal elements of A^3.

Given the adjacency list and edges provided, calculating the number of triangles in the graph will help us determine the number of 3-stars. Let's proceed with this calculation:

The adjacency matrix A for the given graph is:
```
[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Calculating A^3, we get:
```
[[3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2],
 [0, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1],
 [4, 2, 6, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3],
 [2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2],
 [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1],
 [2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1],
 [2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1],
 [4, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 3],
 [2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2]]
```

The trace of A^3 is 33, so the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
