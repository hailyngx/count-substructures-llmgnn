Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, 7, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 14, 13, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 13, 12, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 13, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 2, 13, 0, 4, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 4, 10, 14, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 4, 11, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (9, 7, 13)>
<3, (14, 13, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (8, 10, 11)>
<4, (9, 3, 13)>
<12, (8, 4, 10)>
<13, (3, 11, 7)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 1, 13)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>
<10, (2, 4, 12)>
<11, (2, 13, 0)>
<14, (3, 5, 12)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars identified, we get a total of [15] 3-stars.
