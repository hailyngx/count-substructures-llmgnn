Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, resembling a 3-star pattern.

Looking through the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (13, 2, 19)>
<1, (11, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 19, 0)>
<3, (7, 12, 9)>
<4, (13, 19, 16)>
<5, (18, 19, 1)>
<6, (12, 1, 15)>
<7, (10, 12, 9)>
<11, (10, 1, 17)>
<12, (7, 14, 6)>
<13, (8, 14, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph is [10]. These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
