Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 12, 1)>
<1, (8, 13, 0)>
<2, (7, 11, 6)>
<3, (7, 13, 6)>
<4, (12, 11, 6)>
<5, (10, 6, 0)>
<6, (4, 10, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 13)>
<8, (11, 13, 10)>
<9, (7, 8, 12)>
<10, (11, 13, 14)>
<11, (10, 8, 2)>
<12, (0, 14, 9)>
<13, (10, 8, 1)>
<14, (10, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
