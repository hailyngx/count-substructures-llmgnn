Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of 3-stars around each node and summing them up. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0 has 3-star with (8, 2, 11) <0, (8, 2, 11)>
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars with (5, 7, 1) <1, (5, 7, 1)> and (1, 16, 4) <1, (16, 4, 1)>
- Node 2 has a 3-star with (4, 8, 11) <2, (4, 8, 11)>
- Node 4 has 3-stars with (7, 2, 4) <4, (7, 2, 4)> and (16, 1, 4) <4, (16, 1, 4)>
- Node 5 has a 3-star with (18, 12, 5) <5, (18, 12, 5)>
- Node 6 has a 3-star with (13, 12, 6) <6, (13, 12, 6)>
- Node 7 has a 3-star with (14, 11, 7) <7, (14, 11, 7)>
- Node 8 has a 3-star with (13, 9, 8) <8, (13, 9, 8)>
- Node 9 has no 3-star
- Node 10 has no 3-star
- Node 11 has no 3-star
- Node 12 has no 3-star
- Node 13 has no 3-star
- Node 14 has no 3-star
- Node 15 has no 3-star
- Node 16 has no 3-star
- Node 17 has no 3-star
- Node 18 has no 3-star
- Node 19 has no 3-star

Therefore, counting all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (8, 2, 11)>, <1, (5, 7, 1)>, <1, (16, 4, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 11)>, <4, (7, 2, 4)>, <4, (16, 1, 4)>, and <5, (18, 12, 5)>.
