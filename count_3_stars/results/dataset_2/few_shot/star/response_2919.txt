Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to identify 3-stars:

- For Node 0: No 3-star.
- For Node 1: No 3-star.
- For Node 2: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- For Node 3: No 3-star.
- For Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 4, 3)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star.
- For Node 7: No 3-star.
- For Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 3)>
- For Node 9: No 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, and <5, (9, 4, 3)>.
