Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
As a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
