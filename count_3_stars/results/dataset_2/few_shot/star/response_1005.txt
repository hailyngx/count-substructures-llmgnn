Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 3 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
