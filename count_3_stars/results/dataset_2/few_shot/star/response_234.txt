Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node and checking if it forms any 3-star as the center node.

Considering each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 2)> <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 7, 3)> <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
