Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 6, 4, and 5.
   <0, (6, 4, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, and 7.
   <1, (6, 3, 4)>
   <1, (6, 4, 7)>

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 6, 3, and 5.
   <2, (6, 3, 5)>

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 1, 7, 2, and 8.
   No 3-stars found with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 1, 7, 8, and 0.
   No 3-stars found with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 2, and 0.
   No 3-stars found with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 0.
   <6, (1, 2, 8)>
   <6, (2, 8, 0)>

8. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
   <7, (9, 1, 3)>
   <7, (9, 4, 5)>

9. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, and 4.
   No 3-stars found with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    - Connected to nodes 8, 4, 3, and 7.
    No 3-stars found with Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
