Response:
Given the graph information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges:
   - Node 6: Connected to 2 nodes only.
   - Node 9: Connected to 2 nodes only.
   - Node 3: Connected to 2 nodes only.

2. Identify nodes that have 3 edges:
   - Node 0: Connected to 4 nodes (9, 8, 11, 10)
   - Node 1: Connected to 4 nodes (4, 8, 10, 14)
   - Node 5: Connected to 5 nodes (9, 13, 2, 8, 14)

3. Count the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
   - Node 0: 0 3-stars (since it doesn't have exactly 3 connected nodes).
   - Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (4, 8, 10)>
   - Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (9, 2, 8)>

4. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>
