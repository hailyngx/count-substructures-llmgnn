Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 15, 16, and 29 have exactly 3 neighbors each. These nodes could potentially be centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Now, let's check the neighbors of each of these potential center nodes to see if they form 3-stars.

1. Checking node 15:
Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 29, and 14. Therefore, <15, (27, 29, 14)> is a 3-star.
Total for node 15: <15, (27, 29, 14)>

2. Checking node 16:
Node 16 is connected to nodes 10, 26, and 29. Therefore, <16, (10, 26, 29)> is a 3-star.
Total for node 16: <16, (10, 26, 29)>

3. Checking node 29:
Node 29 is connected to nodes 15, 16, and 6. Therefore, <29, (15, 16, 6)> is a 3-star.
Total for node 29: <29, (15, 16, 6)>, <29, (15, 16, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5].
