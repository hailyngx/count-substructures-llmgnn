Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by checking how many nodes have exactly three neighbors.

Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 14: connected to nodes 29, 18, and 16
- Node 16: connected to nodes 15, 7, and 14
- Node 18: connected to nodes 2, 14, and 0
- Node 19: connected to nodes 3, 25, and 0
- Node 20: connected to nodes 27, 22, and 25
- Node 22: connected to nodes 20, 25, and 12
- Node 23: connected to nodes 26, and 12
- Node 24: connected to nodes 28, 17, and 26

So, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<14, (29, 18, 16)>
<16, (15, 7, 14)>
<18, (2, 14, 0)>
<19, (3, 25, 0)>
<20, (27, 22, 25)>
<22, (20, 25, 12)>
<23, (26, 12)>
<24, (28, 17, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
