Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify 3-stars by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. Then we count the unique 3-stars.

Identifying 3-stars from the adjacency list:
- For Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9)
- For Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 7), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 7)
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 7), (2, 5, 8), (2, 5, 3)
- For Node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8), (3, 5, 9)
- For Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3), (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 3)
- For Node 5: (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 8), (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 9)
- For Node 6: (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 2)
- For Node 7: (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 4), (7, 2, 5), (7, 2, 8)
- For Node 8: (8, 2, 5), (8, 2, 7), (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 5)
- For Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 7)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
