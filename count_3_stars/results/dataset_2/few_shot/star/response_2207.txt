Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph.  
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.  

Starting from each node, we look for nodes that are connected to it and form 3-stars.  

1. For Node 0, (10, 8, 12) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <0, (10, 8, 12)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

2. For Node 1, no 3-stars can be formed.  

3. For Node 2, (9, 13, 5) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <2, (9, 13, 5)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

4. For Node 3, no 3-stars can be formed.  

5. For Node 4, no 3-stars can be formed.  

6. For Node 5, (6, 13, 12) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <5, (6, 13, 12)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

7. For Node 6, (9, 5, 8) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <6, (9, 5, 8)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

8. For Node 7, no 3-stars can be formed.  

9. For Node 8, no 3-stars can be formed.  

10. For Node 9, (6, 2, 10) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <9, (6, 2, 10)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

11. For Node 10, (9, 11, 13) form a 3-star.  
Thus, <10, (9, 11, 13)>  
In total, 1 3-star.  

12. For Node 11, no 3-stars can be formed.  

13. For Node 12, no 3-stars can be formed.  

14. For Node 13, no 3-stars can be formed.  

15. For Node 14, no 3-stars can be formed.  

Together, [6] 3-stars can be found in the given graph.
