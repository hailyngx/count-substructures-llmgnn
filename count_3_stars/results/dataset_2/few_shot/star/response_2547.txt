Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph: first, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Starting from each node, we look for nodes that are connected to it via exactly two edges. These nodes, along with the starting node, form a 3-star. 

Here are the identified 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
