Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

First, we can list all the possible 3-star configurations:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 8, -)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found:
[9]
