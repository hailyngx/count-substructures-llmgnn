Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars found:
<10, (3, 7, 17)>
<11, (9, 13, 19)>
<17, (1, 10, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 18)>
<2, (8, 14, 19)>
<8, (2, 5, 18)>
<9, (11, 13, 14)>
<12, (16, 17, 19)>
<6, (5, 18, 7)>
<0, (3, 16, 13)>
<4, (1, 13, 17)>
<15, (2, 14, 19)>
<16, (0, 13, 5)>
<1, (4, 17, 12)>
<18, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (10, 18, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
