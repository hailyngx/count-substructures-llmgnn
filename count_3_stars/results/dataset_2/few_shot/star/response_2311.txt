Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 18) (12, 10) (12, 17) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (9, 17) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 16) (14, 11) (18, 1) (18, 0) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 0) (0, 18) (0, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 6)

Node 18 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 4, 13, and node 10

Response:
1. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<15, (3, 13, 14)>
<4, (7, 16, 11)>
<7, (4, 10, 8)>
<16, (1, 4, 14)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
