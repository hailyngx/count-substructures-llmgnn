Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node serves as the center of a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 0, there are no 3-stars since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 1, there is a 3-star: <1, (11, 14, 10)>.

- For Node 2, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 3, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 4, there is a 3-star: <4, (12, 5, 0)>.

- For Node 5, there is a 3-star: <5, (8, 13, 11)>.

- For Node 6, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 7, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 8, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 9, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 10, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 11, there is a 3-star: <11, (1, 12, 5)>.

- For Node 12, there is a 3-star: <12, (7, 4, 13)>.

- For Node 13, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

- For Node 14, there is no 3-star since it does not have degree 3.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 14, 10)>, <4, (12, 5, 0)>, <5, (8, 13, 11)>, <12, (7, 4, 13)>.
