Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is a part of any 3-star structure. 
2. A 3-star structure involves a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<13, (22, 8, 26)>
<6, (9, 28, 21)>
<4, (7, 27, 28)>
<7, (4, 1, 27)>
<8, (13, 29, 27)>
<9, (6)>
<10, (22, 5)>
<11, (17, 2)>
<12, (14, 0, 18)>
<13, (22, 8, 26)>
<14, (23, 28, 26)>
<15, (23, 1, 15)>
<16, (4, 18, 2)>
<17, (11, 0, 12)>
<18, (21, 16, 12)>
<19, (1, 21, 3)>
<20, (27, 16, 3)>
<21, (6, 19, 18)>
<22, (13, 10)>
<23, (26, 15, 14)>
<24, (13, 1, 5)>
<25, (24)>
<26, (13, 23, 14)>
<27, (4, 8, 3)>
<28, (6, 4, 3)>
<29, (13, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
