Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (11, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 14)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<8, (14, 10, 15)>
<11, (16, 19, 6)>
<16, (11, 18, 19)>
<19, (11, 16, 17)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
