Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Consider each node as the center of the potential 3-star:
    - Node 0: <0, (5, 12, 13)>
    - Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 13)>
    - Node 2: <2, (9, 6, 11)>
    - Node 3: No 3-star
    - Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 11)>
    - Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 0)>
    - Node 6: <6, (9, 3, 2)>
    - Node 7: <7, (10, 12, 1)>
    - Node 8: No 3-star
    - Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 10)>
    - Node 10: <10, (9, 12, 7)>
    - Node 11: <11, (14, 8, 4)>
    - Node 12: <12, (6, 10, 7)>
    - Node 13: <13, (9, 6, 10)>
    - Node 14: <14, (11, 2, 8)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified: 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
