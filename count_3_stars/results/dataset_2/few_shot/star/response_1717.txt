Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 8, 2)> 
<1, (5, 6, 8)> 
<2, (5, 4, 3)> 
<3, (6, 4, 8)> 
<4, (5, 9, 8)> 
<5, (2, 1, 4)> 
<6, (9, 1, 3)> 
<7, (9, 2, 1)> 
<8, (4, 0, 3)> 
<9, (6, 4, 7)> 

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: 
[10]
