Response:
There are a total of 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (18, 16, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 11)>
<2, (18, 9, 11)>
<3, (14, 10, 13)>
<4, (7, 16, 17)>
<5, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (14, 1, 15)>
<7, (4, 12, 17)>
<8, (5, 11, 18)>
<9, (17, 2, 16)>
<10, (3, 6, 12)>
<11, (1, 2, 8)>
<12, (7, 10, 12)>
<13, (3, 15, 14)>
<14, (3, 6, 17)>
<15, (13, 2, 6)>
<16, (0, 9, 19)>
<17, (4, 14, 9)>
<18, (0, 2, 8)>
<19, (16, 0, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-star configurations in the graph is [20].
