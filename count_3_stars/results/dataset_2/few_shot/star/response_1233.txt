Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star is uniquely identified by the central node and the three leaves connected to that central node.

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given information:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes along with their connected leaves. For example, Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 12, 1, and 13. This implies that the 3-stars relating to Node 10 are:
   <10, (3, 6, 12)>
   <10, (3, 1, 13)>
   
2. Similarly, we can identify the 3-stars for the rest of the central nodes:
   <0, (11, 13, 9)>
   <1, (10, 13, 14)>
   <2, (11, 9, 14)>
   <3, (10, 6, 13)>
   <5, (6, 13, 3)>
   <6, (10, 12, 13)>
   <9, (2, 14, 3)>
   <11, (14, 0, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
  
Hence, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
   <10, (3, 6, 12)>
   <10, (3, 1, 13)>
   <0, (11, 13, 9)>
   <1, (10, 13, 14)>
   <2, (11, 9, 14)>
   <3, (10, 6, 13)>
   <5, (6, 13, 3)>
   <6, (10, 12, 13)>
   <9, (2, 14, 3)>
   <11, (14, 0, 12)>
