Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find and list all the unique 3-star graphs:

<14, (13, 17, 24)>
<17, (13, 15, 12)>
<8, (22, 27, 14)>
<22, (5, 14, 8)>
<13, (10, 14, 17)>
<12, (11, 17, 27)>
<27, (4, 12, 24)>
<15, (4, 6, 17)>
<20, (7, 28, 29)>
<0, (21, 23, 3)>
<21, (18, 25, 28)>
<6, (1, 15, 19)>
<28, (25, 20, 21)>
<18, (1, 9, 16)>
<29, (9, 16, 20)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs: [14].
