Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. The nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves) are:
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 3, 8, and 29)
- Node 25 (connected to nodes 17, 20, and 16)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 23, 19, and 16)
- Node 20 (connected to nodes 25, 9, and 24)
- Node 26 (connected to nodes 23, 1, and 11)
- Node 22 (connected to nodes 9, 2, and 3)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<14, (3, 8, 29)>
<25, (17, 20, 16)>
<8, (23, 19, 16)>
<20, (25, 9, 24)>
<26, (23, 1, 11)>
<22, (9, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
