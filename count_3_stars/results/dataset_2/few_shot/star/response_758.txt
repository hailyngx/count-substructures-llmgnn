Response:
Let's first find the nodes that are connected in 3-star patterns. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the possible 3-star patterns are:
1. <1, (21, 15, 23)>
2. <2, (10, 4, 12)>
3. <3, (25, 17, 20)>
4. <5, (3, 28, 14)>
5. <6, (29, 17, 16)>
6. <7, (8, 9)>
7. <8, (23, 20, 7)>
8. <9, (18, 11, 7)>
9. <10, (21, 23, 17)>
10. <11, (9, 22)>
11. <12, (26, 18, 2)>
12. <14, (21, 5)>
13. <15, (1, 25, 4)>
14. <16, (23, 12, 24)>
15. <17, (3, 25, 10)>
16. <18, (21, 9, 12)>
17. <20, (3, 8, 0)>
18. <24, (10, 15, 16)>
19. <28, (20, 27, 5)>
20. <29, (25, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-star patterns in the graph.
