Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: <0, (5, 7, 6)>
- For node 1: <1, (4, 2, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (9, 1, 6)>
- For node 3: <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- For node 4: <4, (9, 1, 3)>
- For node 5: <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- For node 6: <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- For node 7: <7, (9, 0, 3)>
- For node 8: <8, (9, 1, 6)>
- For node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
