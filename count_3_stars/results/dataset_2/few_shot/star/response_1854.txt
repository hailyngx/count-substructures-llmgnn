Response:
The 3-star graphs can take different forms, but they all consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph and count the number of unique 3-stars present.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the following potential 3-stars:
1. Node 1: (16, 9, 8), (16, 12, 6), (9, 12, 27), (8, 12, 7), (9, 1, 29) [5 possibilities]
2. Node 3: (9, 25, 28) [1 possibility]
3. Node 5: (27, 6, 4), (27, 0, 18) [2 possibilities]
4. Node 6: (21, 1, 16) [1 possibility]
5. Node 7: (24, 10, 7), (24, 8, 26) [2 possibilities]
6. Node 9: (29, 1, 9) [1 possibility]
7. Node 11: (24, 16, 1), (24, 16, 4) [2 possibilities]
8. Node 12: (22, 27, 18) [1 possibility]
9. Node 14: (25, 13, 23) [1 possibility]
10. Node 15: (22, 23, 27) [1 possibility]
11. Node 16: (21, 1, 4) [1 possibility]
12. Node 17: (11, 28, 17) [1 possibility]
13. Node 18: (29, 27, 0), (29, 18, 21) [2 possibilities]
14. Node 19: (25, 28, 3) [1 possibility]
15. Node 21: (6, 20, 21) [1 possibility]
16. Node 23: (15, 14, 27) [1 possibility]
17. Node 24: (26, 7, 8) [1 possibility]
18. Node 25: (10, 19, 28) [1 possibility]
19. Node 27: (12, 18, 5) [1 possibility]
20. Node 28: (17, 19, 3) [1 possibility]

Therefore, there are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (16, 9, 8)>, <1, (16, 12, 6)>, <1, (9, 12, 27)>, <1, (8, 12, 7)>, <1, (9, 1, 29)>, <3, (9, 25, 28)>, <5, (27, 6, 4)>, <5, (27, 0, 18)>, <6, (21, 1, 16)>, <7, (24, 10, 7)>, <7, (24, 8, 26)>, <9, (29, 1, 9)>, <11, (24, 16, 1)>, <11, (24, 16, 4)>, <12, (22, 27, 18)>, <14, (25, 13, 23)>, <15, (22, 23, 27)>, <16, (21, 1, 4)>, <17, (11, 28, 17)>, <18, (29, 27, 0)>, <18, (29, 18, 21)>, <19, (25, 28, 3)>, <21, (6, 20, 21)>, <23, (15, 14, 27)>, <24, (26, 7, 8)>, <25, (10, 19, 28)>, <27, (12, 18, 5)>, <28, (17, 19, 3)>
