Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (27, 17, 23)>
<26, (28, 20, 21)>
<27, (25, 15, 19)>
<2, (8, 22, 20)>
<6, (17, 10, 2)>
<4, (12, 6, 19)>
<21, (23, 11, 26)>
<10, (15, 11, 0)>
<16, (28, 26, 19)>
<12, (29, 7, 18)>
<0, (14, 10, 7)>
<22, (2, 20, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
