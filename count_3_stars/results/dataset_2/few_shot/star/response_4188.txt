Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 4

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find the number of unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to 6, 2, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to 4, 2, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to 3, 6, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to 9, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 6, 9, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to 3, 4, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to 1, 2, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>

We found a total of 8 unique 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
