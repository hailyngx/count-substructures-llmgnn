Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: central nodes in 3-stars.
    - Node 1, 11, 13, 18 are connected to three other nodes.
    - Let's write these down: {1, 11, 13, 18}

2. For each central node, find the leaves (nodes connected to the central node) and form 3-stars accordingly.

3-stars for Node 1:
    - Leaves: (2, 13, 16)
    - Forming the 3-stars: <1, (2, 13, 16)>

3-stars for Node 11:
    - Leaves: (12, 16, 18)
    - Forming the 3-stars: <11, (12, 16, 18)>

3-stars for Node 13:
    - Leaves: (1, 14, 15)
    - Forming the 3-stars: <13, (1, 14, 15)>

3-stars for Node 18:
    - Leaves: (5, 7, 10)
    - Forming the 3-stars: <18, (5, 7, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 13, 16)>, <11, (12, 16, 18)>, <13, (1, 14, 15)>, <18, (5, 7, 10)>.
