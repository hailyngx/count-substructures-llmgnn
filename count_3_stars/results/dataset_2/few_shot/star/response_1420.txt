Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 2: (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8)
2. Node 4: (3, 4, 5), (4, 2, 8), (4, 5, 12), (4, 5, 7)
3. Node 5: (3, 4, 5), (5, 4, 13), (5, 12, 14), (5, 12, 0), (5, 7, 13)
4. Node 6: (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 14)
5. Node 7: (1, 5, 7), (3, 5, 13), (5, 7, 13)
6. Node 8: (0, 2, 8), (1, 8, 10), (3, 4, 8)
7. Node 9: (6, 9, 14), (7, 9, 13), (9, 10, 11), (9, 10, 3)
8. Node 10: (1, 10, 2), (9, 10, 3)
9. Node 11: (8, 10, 11)
10. Node 12: (0, 5, 12), (12, 5, 14)
11. Node 13: (3, 5, 13), (5, 7, 13)
12. Node 14: (1, 12, 14), (6, 9, 14) 

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [12]
  
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (5, 4, 13)>
<5, (5, 12, 14)>
