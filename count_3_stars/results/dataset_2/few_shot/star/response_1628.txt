Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 0. This forms a 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (8, 1, 0)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 7. This forms a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (6, 1, 7)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 2. This forms a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 9, 8)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 0. This forms a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (7, 5, 0)>
6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6. This forms a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (5, 9, 6)>
7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (5, 6, 8)>
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2. This forms a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
