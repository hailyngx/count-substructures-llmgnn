Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to see how many 3-stars exist in the graph:

Central Node 0: (adjacent nodes: 17, 5, 2)
Central Node 2: (adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 9)
Central Node 3: (adjacent nodes: 7, 10, 12)
Central Node 4: (adjacent nodes: 19, 16)
Central Node 5: (adjacent nodes: 17, 1)
Central Node 7: (adjacent nodes: 3, 11, 18)
Central Node 8: (adjacent nodes: 2, 9, 14)
Central Node 9: (adjacent nodes: 11, 2, 8)
Central Node 10: (adjacent nodes: 11, 3, 18)
Central Node 11: (adjacent nodes: 7, 10, 9)
Central Node 13: (adjacent nodes: 1, 19, 14)
Central Node 14: (adjacent nodes: 8, 13)
Central Node 16: (adjacent nodes: 4, 10)
Central Node 18: (adjacent nodes: 7, 10, 8, 15, 0)
Central Node 19: (adjacent nodes: 4, 1, 13)

Based on the above analysis, we can see that the central nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes are: 0, 5, 13. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.

Finally, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (17, 5, 2)>
<5, (17, 1, 0)>
<13, (1, 19, 14)>

Thus, the final answer is [3].
