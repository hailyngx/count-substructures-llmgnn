Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 2.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and has only 2 connections.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 2.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 0.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 4.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.

2. Now, let's find all unique 3-stars in the graph:
   - <0, (5, 9, 2)>
   - <2, (4, 3, 8)>
   - <4, (8, 2, 0)>
   - <5, (9, 6, 7)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 8)>
   - <7, (5, 9, 3)>
   - <8, (9, 6, 4)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [8]
