Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars are: 5, 9, 14, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 18, 17, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 
For node 5: (5, 9, 13), (5, 9, 8) [2 unique 3-stars]
For node 9: (9, 5, 11), (9, 5, 13) [2 unique 3-stars]
For node 14: (14, 17, 10) [1 unique 3-star]
For node 10: (10, 14, 15), (10, 14, 12), (10, 14, 1), (10, 14, 11) [4 unique 3-stars]
For node 11: (11, 9, 10), (11, 9, 7), (11, 9, 6),  (11, 9, 5) [4 unique 3-stars]
For node 12: (12, 10, 4), (12, 10, 7), (12, 10, 3) [3 unique 3-stars]
For node 13: (13, 5, 16), (13, 5, 3) [2 unique 3-stars]
For node 15: (15, 10, 8) [1 unique 3-star]
For node 6: (6, 11, 1) [1 unique 3-star]
For node 7: (7, 11, 12), (7, 11, 16), (7, 11, 18),(7, 11, 9) [4 unique 3-stars]
For node 4: (4, 12, 19), (4, 12, 3) [2 unique 3-stars]
For node 0: (0, 19, 4) [1 unique 3-star]
For node 3: (3, 13, 12), (3, 13, 4), (3, 13, 2), (3, 13, 18) [4 unique 3-stars]
For node 18: (18, 7, 3) [1 unique 3-star]
