Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
    
The nodes and their connections can be characterized as follows:
- Node 0: (9, 12, 14)
- Node 1: (6, 7, 4, 18)
- Node 2: (9, 5)
- Node 3: (7, 18, 11)
- Node 4: (13, 1)
- Node 5: (7, 13, 2)
- Node 6: (9, 1, 15)
- Node 7: (10, 12, 3, 5, 1)
- Node 8: Not connected
- Node 9: (6, 2, 15, 0)
- Node 10: (17, 12, 7)
- Node 11: (3)
- Node 12: (10, 7, 0)
- Node 13: (14, 4, 5, 16)
- Node 14: (0, 18, 13)
- Node 15: (6, 9, 16)
- Node 16: (18, 13, 19, 1, 15)
- Node 17: (10)
- Node 18: (14, 16, 1, 3)
- Node 19: (0, 16)

Now, let's count the 3-stars in this graph by checking for each node being the center of a 3-star structure:
- Node 0: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 18)>
- Node 2: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 3: <3, (7, 18, 11)>
- Node 4: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 5: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 15)>
- Node 7: <7, (10, 12, 3)>
- Node 8: Not connected to any node
- Node 9: <9, (6, 2, 15)>
- Node 10: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 11: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 12: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 13: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 14: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 15: <15, (6, 9, 16)>
- Node 16: <16, (18, 13, 19)>
- Node 17: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 18: Not a center for any 3-star
- Node 19: Not a center for any 3-star

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 7, 18)>
- <3, (7, 18, 11)>
- <6, (9, 1, 15)>
- <9, (6, 2, 15)>
- <15, (6, 9, 16)>
