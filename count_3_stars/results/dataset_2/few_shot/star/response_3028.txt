Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, as per the definition of a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 9 each satisfy this condition. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
