Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph by identifying all the 3-stars present.

### Nodes with 3-Stars
1. Node 0: (3, 12, 5)
2. Node 1: (7, 19, 12)
3. Node 2: (9, 10, 5)
4. Node 3: (8, 0, 4)
5. Node 4: (17, 3, 14)
6. Node 5: (13, 0, 2) and (13, 5, 18)
7. Node 6: (9, 10, 16)
8. Node 7: (18, 1, 7)
9. Node 8: (13, 14, 16) and (9, 8, 13)
10. Node 9: (2, 6, 10) and (2, 9, 15) and (6, 9, 16)
11. Node 12: (8, 0, 18) and (1, 7, 19)
12. Node 13: (9, 8, 5) and (5, 13, 18)
13. Node 14: (11, 4, 14)
14. Node 15: (9, 15, 17)
15. Node 16: (6, 9, 16) and (8, 9, 13)
16. Node 17: (4, 15, 17)
17. Node 18: (7, 5, 18) and (12, 18, 1)
18. Node 19: (18, 1, 19)

There are a total of 18 unique 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [18].
