Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. These nodes must have a degree of 3 in the graph. The nodes with a degree of 3 are: 6, 9, 4, and 8.

Now, we will check the neighbors of each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star. 

For node 6:
- <6, (9, 5, 7)>
- <6, (9, 3, 0)>

For node 9:
- <9, (6, 8, 4)>

For node 4:
- <4, (9, 8, 2)>
- <4, (9, 8, 1)>

For node 8:
- <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- <8, (9, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [7].
