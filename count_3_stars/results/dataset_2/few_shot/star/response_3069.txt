Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, 10, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 10, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 12, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 14, 12, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 11, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, 13, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<1, (2, 10, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 12)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 11, 8)>
<6, (5, 14, 12)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (11, 10, 13)>
<10, (9, 1, 0)>
<11, (5, 9, 13)>
<12, (6, 4, 0)>
<13, (11)>
<14, (6, 4, 8)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars, and the final answer is:
[14]
