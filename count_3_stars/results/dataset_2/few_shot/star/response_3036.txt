Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the center nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

Let's now count the number of 3-stars for each center node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (8, 19, 6) => 0 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (4, 15, 7) => 1 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (11, 18, 1) => 4 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (9, 19, 15) => 5 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (11, 17, 0) => 6 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (17, 0, 7) => 8 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (5, 15, 14) => 9 has [1] 3-star: <9, (5, 15, 14)>.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors: (18, 6, 4) => 11 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: (18, 2, 15) => 12 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: (10, 17, 14) => 13 has [0] 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors: (9, 10, 13) => 14 has [1] 3-star: <14, (9, 10, 13)>.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: (5, 9, 1) => 15 has [1] 3-star: <15, (5, 9, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are: <9, (5, 15, 14)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>, and <15, (5, 9, 1)>.
