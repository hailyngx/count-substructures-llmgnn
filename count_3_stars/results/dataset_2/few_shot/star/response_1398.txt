Response:
I will first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars: 
<5, (22, 2, 8)>
<6, (8, 21, 15)>
<7, (24, 1, 4)>
<11, (25, 27, 10)>
<13, (18, 9, 19)>
<15, (29, 7, 21)>
<16, (18, 6, 9)>
<18, (21, 14, 13)>
<19, (28, 26, 9)>
<20, (27, 22, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
