Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, we can start by identifying the 3-star patterns which consist of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to this center node. Since a 3-star has 1 center node and 3 leaf nodes, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in this graph.
