Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, nodes 4, 7, 1, and 9 have degree 4, while nodes 0, 3, and 2 have degree 5, which means these nodes can be the center of a 3-star configuration. 

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<0, (4, 9, 5)>
<0, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
<3, (9, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 5)>
<7, (4, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 6, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 0, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 0)>
<7, (3, 9, 2)>
<9, (7, 6, 1)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>
<9, (4, 5, 2)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: [32]
