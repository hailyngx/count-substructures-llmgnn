Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighboring nodes. Then, we identify if these four nodes form a 3-star. 

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <6, (2, 9, 13)>
- <9, (6, 10, 19)>
- <10, (16, 17, 19)>
- <11, (1, 2, 12)>
- <12, (5, 11, 15)>
- <15, (1, 12, 14)>
- <17, (5, 8, 10)>
- <19, (8, 9, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
