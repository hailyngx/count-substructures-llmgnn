Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. These are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 22, 7, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 25, 19, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 14 and 29.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 10, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7 and 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 22, 9, and 15.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 26, and 6.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 1, and 28.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 22, 21, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 4, and 6.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 18 and 29.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 29, and 4.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 6.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 14.

Now, for each node, we find the 3-star patterns by checking if the nodes it is connected to can form a 3-star with it as the center node.

From the given edges:
- Node 18: (22, 18, 21) forms a 3-star centered at 18.
- Node 22: (18, 9, 12) forms a 3-star centered at 22.
- Node 9: (22, 10, 12) forms a 3-star centered at 9.
- Node 10: (27, 1, 9) forms a 3-star centered at 10.
- Node 12: (22, 9, 15) forms a 3-star centered at 12.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-star patterns in the given graph is 5.

[5]

Unique 3-star patterns:
<18, (22, 21, 13)>
<22, (18, 9, 12)>
<9, (22, 10, 12)>
<10, (27, 1, 9)>
<12, (22, 9, 15)>
