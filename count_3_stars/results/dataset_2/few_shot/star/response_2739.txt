Response:
1. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
    - Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (11, 21, 26)>
    - Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 7, 26)>
    - Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (10, 11, 18)>
    - Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (10, 11, 22)>
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (16, 21, 12)>
    - Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 2, 6)>
    - Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (23, 2, 15)>
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6,(7, 2, 15)>
    - Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (22, 16, 1)>
    - Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (23, 24, 27)>
    - Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (21, 0, 29)>
    - Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (26, 14, 27)>
    - Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (26, 12, 19)>
    - Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (11, 6, 9)>
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (28, 7, 12)>
    - Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (24, 5, 6)>

2. Count the total number of 3-stars: [16]

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
