Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars for each central node and then summing them up. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
1. For central node 0: (15, 13, 0)
2. For central node 1: (7, 17, 1)
3. For central node 2: (22, 24, 2)
4. For central node 3: (13, 8, 3)
5. For central node 4: (15, 22, 4)
6. For central node 5: (11, 26, 5)
7. For central node 6: (25, 21, 6)
8. For central node 7: (17, 18, 7)
9. For central node 8: (19, 29, 8)
10. For central node 9: (22, 29, 9)
11. For central node 10: (17, 19, 10)
12. For central node 11: (5, 17, 11)
13. For central node 12: (15, 22, 12)
14. For central node 13: (7, 0, 13)
15. For central node 14: (19, 18, 14)
16. For central node 15: (27, 12, 15)
17. For central node 16: (21, 29, 16)
18. For central node 17: (11, 10, 17)
19. For central node 18: (14, 7, 18)
20. For central node 19: (8, 24, 19)
21. For central node 20: (11, 23, 20)
22. For central node 21: (16, 26, 21)
23. For central node 22: (23, 12, 22)
24. For central node 23: (27, 20, 23)
25. For central node 24: (10, 5, 24)
26. For central node 25: (6, 25, 0) - Since 25 is not connected to any other node, only one possible 3-star.
27. For central node 26: (27, 5, 21)
28. For central node 27: (15, 23, 27)
29. For central node 28: No connections, so 0 possible 3-stars.
30. For central node 29: (16, 8, 9)

Counting all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
