Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. In this graph, a 3-star can have nodes {A, B, C, D}, where node A is the center node and nodes B, C, and D are the leaves of the star.

2. Let's go through each node and check if a 3-star can be formed with that node as the center:

- Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 11)>
- Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 4: <4, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 5: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 7: <7, (8, 10, 13)>
- Node 8: <8, (11, 5, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (13, 1, 0)>
- Node 10: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 11: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 12: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 13: Not a center of any 3-star
- Node 14: <14, (11, 5, 13)>

3. Count of 3-stars: [4] 
   
4. Unique 3-stars: <>
- <1, (3, 6, 11)>
- <7, (8, 10, 13)>
- <8, (11, 5, 7)>
- <9, (13, 1, 0)>
