Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given graph's edges and node connections, the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 6, 2)>
<15, (7, 9, 19)>
<14, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (10, 17, 6)>
<7, (15, 19, 13)>
<0, (3, 8, 12)>
<16, (6, 0, 18)>
<17, (10, 5, 2)>
<18, (8, 19, 16)>
<13, (7, 1, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
