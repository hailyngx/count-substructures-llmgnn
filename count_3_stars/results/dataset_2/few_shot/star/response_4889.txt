Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them out:

1. <0, (14, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (14, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 10)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 13)>
5. <4, (19, 1, 15)>
6. <5, (8, 10, -)>
7. <6, (7, 18, 3)>
8. <7, (16, 6, 2)>
9. <8, (1, 17, 5)>
10. <9, (19, 10, 12)>
11. <10, (9, 2, 5)>
12. <11, (1, 17, -)>
13. <12, (9, 3, -)>
14. <13, (3, 6, -)>
15. <14, (19, 1, -)>
16. <15, (18, 8, 4)>
17. <16, (7, 18, -)>
18. <17, (11, 8, -)>
19. <18, (16, 19, 15)>
20. <19, (4, 14, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
