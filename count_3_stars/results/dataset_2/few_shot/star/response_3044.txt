Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 13, 9)>
<2, (18, 15, 0)>
<3, (1, 0, 10)>
<4, (8, 0, 15)>
<5, (18, 12, 17)>
<6, (11, 17, 0)>
<7, (18, 14, 19)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 19)>
<13, (1, 17, 19)>
<14, (7, 19, 13)>
<15, (2, 4, 0)>
<16, (11, 19, 13)>
<17, (11, 6, 12)>
<18, (1, 2, 5)>
<19, (16, 14, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
