Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 14, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, 14, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 12, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 11, 8, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 7, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 6, 13, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 12, 1, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 1

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Node 6 is connected to 9, 1, and 12.
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 9, 8, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to 5, 8, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to 6, 12, and 1.

So the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 1, 12)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 14)>
<3, (5, 8, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 1)>

Counting them all, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
