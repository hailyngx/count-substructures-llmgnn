Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These occurrences form 3-stars.

Starting with the adjacency list provided, let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 3, 8)>  
<1, (5, 9, 3)>  
<2, (9, 4, 7)>  
<3, (4, 7, 1)>  
<4, (7, 8, 2)>  
<5, (9, 6, 8)>  
<6, (5, 1, -)>  
<7, (9, 4, 3)>  
<8, (9, 4, 2)>  
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
