Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, we list all possible 3-stars based on the given adjacency list:
<0, (8, 14, 10)>
<1, (14, 6, 12)>
<2, (0)>
<3, (7, 6)>
<4, (16, 9, 17)>
<5, (19, 15, 7)>
<6, (13, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 5, 18)>
<8, (11, 13, 0)>
<9, (4, 14, 19)>
<10, (13, 0)>
<11, (16, 8)>
<12, (16, 14, 1)>
<13, (16, 8, 10)>
<14, (0, 1, 9)>
<15, (5, 6)>
<16, (11, 12, 13, 18)>
<17, (4)>
<18, (16, 7)>
<19, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[19]
