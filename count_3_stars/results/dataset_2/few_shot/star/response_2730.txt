Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 8, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 8, 2)>
3. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
5. <2, (4, 7, 5)>
6. <3, (4, 6, 5)>
7. <4, (7, 1, 2)>
8. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
9. <6, (7, 3, 0)>
10. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
11. <8, (7, 5, 0)>
12. <9, (7, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
