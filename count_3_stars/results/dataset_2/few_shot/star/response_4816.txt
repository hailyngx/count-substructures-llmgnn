Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 17, 7)>
<1, (5, 15, 19)>
<2, (18, 10, 11)>
<3, (4, 7, 15)>
<4, (18, 13, 16)>
<5, (13, 1, 17)>
<6, (9, 13, 4)>
<7, (3, 15, 17)>
<8, (9, 19, 1)>
<9, (6, 14, 8)>
<10, (2, 12, 11)>
<11, (0, 17, 2)>
<12, (19, 10, 11)>
<13, (6, 5, 4)>
<14, (9, 15, 6)>
<15, (7, 1, 14)>
<16, (4, 13, 3)>
<17, (5, 0, 7)>
<18, (2, 4, 17)>
<19, (8, 1, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
