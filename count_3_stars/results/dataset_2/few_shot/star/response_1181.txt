Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by finding a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them down.

<1, (9, 3, 23)>
<3, (1, 25, 11)>
<5, (9, 8, 24)>
<6, (9, 7, 22)>
<7, (6, 2, 13)>
<8, (5, 21, 10)>
<9, (1, 6, 16)>
<11, (3, 14, 27)>
<12, (25, 2, 22)>
<13, (16, 29, 23)>
<14, (11, 4, 16)>
<15, (17, 28, not connected)>
<16, (9, 14, 13)>
<17, (15, 12, not connected)>
<18, (26, 1, 29)>
<19, (25, 0, 22)>
<20, (27, 4, not connected)>
<21, (8, 28, 23)>
<22, (6, 19, 12)>
<23, (3, 1, 21)>
<24, (5, 25, not connected)>
<25, (3, 19, 12)>
<26, (18, not connected, not connected)>
<27, (6, 20, 11)>
<28, (15, 21, not connected)>
<29, (18, 0, 13)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-star graphs.
