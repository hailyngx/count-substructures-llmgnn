Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given information, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<5, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>

Since each 3-star has been listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
