Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to the central node. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, for each node, we can see if there exists a 3-star centered at that node by checking if it has exactly three neighbors and those neighbors are pairwise connected.

Checking each node, we find the following 3-stars:
1. Node 0 : 
   <0, (4, 1, 2)>
2. Node 1 : 
   <1, (5, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 : 
   <2, (9, 8, 0)>
4. Node 3 :
   <3, (9, 4, 7)>
5. Node 4 :
   <4, (5, 7, 0)>
6. Node 5 :
   <5, (9, 6, 1)>
7. Node 6 : 
   <6, (5, 7, 8)>
8. Node 7 : 
   <7, (5, 4, 3)>
9. Node 8 : 
   <8, (9, 1, 2)>
10. Node 9 : 
    <9, (5, 8, 2)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
