Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can search for each possible 3-star configuration.

Let's start by checking each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star graph. A 3-star in this context consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-star configurations found in the given graph:

<0, (7, 12, 18)>
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<0, (7, 18, 1)>
<1, (0, 19, 9)>
<2, (15, 9, 17)>
<3, (4, 18, 14)>
<4, (10, 3, 14)>
<5, (16, 7, 6)>
<6, (8, 5, 19)>
<7, (0, 15, 5)>
<8, (19, 5, 6)>
<9, (16, 2, 14)>
<10, (16, 18, 14)>
<11, (13, 17, 7)>
<12, (14, 0, 0)>
<13, (11, 17, 11)>
<14, (12, 3, 10)>
<15, (7, 2, 7)>
<16, (9, 5, 10)>
<17, (11, 19, 2)>
<18, (10, 0, 3)>
<19, (17, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
