Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node for each potential 3-star and then check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Not a central node for any 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (9, 11, 13)>
   
3. Node 2:
   - Not a central node for any 3-star.

4. Node 3:
   - 3-star: <3, (1, 10, 12)>

5. Node 4:
   - 3-star: <4, (11, 12, 6)>

6. Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 11)>
   
7. Node 6:
   - Not a central node for any 3-star.

8. Node 7:
   - Not a central node for any 3-star.

9. Node 8:
   - Not a central node for any 3-star.

10. Node 9:
    - 3-star: <9, (1, 10, 7)>
    
11. Node 10:
    - 3-star: <10, (9, 11, 7)>

12. Node 11:
    - 3-star: <11, (5, 4, 13)>
    
13. Node 12:
    - Not a central node for any 3-star.

14. Node 13:
    - Not a central node for any 3-star.

15. Node 14:
    - Not a central node for any 3-star.

The 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<1, (9, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 10, 12)>
<4, (11, 12, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 11)>
<9, (1, 10, 7)>
<10, (9, 11, 7)>
<11, (5, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
