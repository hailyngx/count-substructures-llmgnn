Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes where one node is the central node and the other two nodes are connected to it. Given that each 3-star consists of one central node and three connected nodes, we will look for a central node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to 5 nodes
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 5 is connected to 5 nodes
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes
- Node 8 is connected to 6 nodes
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes

Only Node 2, 3, 7, and 9 have exactly 3 connections. Let's proceed to find the 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

For Node 2:
- <2, (4, 8, 0)>
- [1]

For Node 3:
- <3, (5, 6, 0)>
- [1]

For Node 7:
- <7, (5, 9, 8)>
- [1]

For Node 9:
- <9, (5, 8, 7)>
- [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
