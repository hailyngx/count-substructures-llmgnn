Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0)

Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
   
   - <0, (3, 8, 2)>
   - <0, (3, 2, 7)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 7)>
   - <1, (9, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (9, 8, 5)>
   - <2, (1, 8, 7)>
   - <3, (9, 1, 7)>
   - <3, (9, 0, 5)>
   - <4, (9, 8, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (3, 8, 2)>
   - <5, (2, 8, 0)>
   - <6, (5)>
   - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 2, 0)>
   - <7, (3, 5, 2)>
   - <8, (4, 2, 5)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 0)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 2)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <9, (4, 2, 3)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-star structures found: [22]

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is 22.
