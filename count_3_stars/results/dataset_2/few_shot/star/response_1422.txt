Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we see that nodes with 3 connections are: 
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 13, Node 16, Node 21, Node 24

From the edges list, let's list the 3-star combinations by utilizing the nodes with 3 connections: 
- For Node 0: (0, 1), [0, (1, 22, 12)]
- For Node 3: (3, 26), [3, (26, 5, 10)]
- For Node 4: (4, 2), [4, (2, 18, 11)]
- For Node 13: (13, 7), [13, (7, 15, 10)]
- For Node 16: (16, 17), [16, (17, 24, 19)]
- For Node 21: (21, 23), [21, (23, 15, 29)]
- For Node 24: (24, 16), [24, (16, 17, X)] (No other node connected to node 24)

Combining all unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 22, 12)>, <3, (26, 5, 10)>, <4, (2, 18, 11)>, <13, (7, 15, 10)>, <16, (17, 24, 19)>, <21, (23, 15, 29)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6. 
Therefore, the answer is [6].
