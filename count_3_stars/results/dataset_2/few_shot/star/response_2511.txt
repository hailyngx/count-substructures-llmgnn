Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Starting from each node, check if there are two nodes that share an edge with it. If found, these three nodes form a 3-star.
2. Count the unique 3-stars.

Based on the given information, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 10, 13)>
<3, (6, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 12)>
<5, (1, 4, 10)>
<6, (0, 3, 14)>
<7, (4, 6, 13)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (2, 14, 8)>
<10, (0, 5, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 13)>
<12, (0, 4, 9)>
<13, (2, 7, 11)>
<14, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
