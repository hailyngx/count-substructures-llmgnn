Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We will look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, and each set of neighbors forms a 3-star. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have only 3 neighbors are:
- Node 6 {14}
- Node 9 {18}
- Node 0 {16}

Next, let's look for nodes that have more than 3 neighbors and identify the 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (15, 10, 13) <3, (15, 10, 13)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (8, 12, 10) <5, (8, 12, 10)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (16, 13, 17) <7, (16, 13, 17)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: (7, 12, 0) <17, (7, 12, 0)>
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (12, 4, 0) <19, (12, 4, 0)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[5]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<3, (15, 10, 13)>, <5, (8, 12, 10)>, <7, (16, 13, 17)>, <17, (7, 12, 0)>, <19, (12, 4, 0)> [5]
