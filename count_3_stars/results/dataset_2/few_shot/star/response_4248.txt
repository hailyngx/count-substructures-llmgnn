Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided:
- For Node 0, the 3-stars are: <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 6, 11)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>
- For Node 1, the 3-stars are: <1, (9, 8, 12)>, <1, (9, 1, 12)>, <1, (8, 1, 12)>
- For Node 2, the 3-stars are: <2, (5, 12, 11)>, <2, (5, 2, 11)>, <2, (12, 2, 11)>
- For Node 3, the 3-stars are: <3, (4, 6, 10)>, <3, (4, 3, 6)>, <3, (6, 3, 10)>
- For Node 4, the 3-stars are: <4, (5, 12, 3)>, <4, (5, 4, 12)>, <4, (12, 4, 7)>
- For Node 5, the 3-stars are: <5, (2, 12, 11)>, <5, (2, 5, 11)>, <5, (12, 5, 4)>
- For Node 6, the 3-stars are: <6, (9, 4, 3)>, <6, (9, 6, 14)>, <6, (4, 6, 3)>
- For Node 7, the 3-stars are: <7, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (12, 7, 14)>, <7, (13, 7, 14)>
- For Node 8, the 3-stars are: <8, (13, 11, 14)>, <8, (13, 8, 11)>, <8, (11, 8, 14)>
- For Node 9, the 3-stars are: <9, (6, 14, 1)>, <9, (6, 9, 14)>, <9, (14, 9, 1)>
- For Node 10, the 3-stars are: <10, (7, 13, 14)>, <10, (7, 10, 14)>, <10, (13, 10, 14)>
- For Node 11, the 3-stars are: <11, (14, 0, 2)>, <11, (14, 11, 0)>, <11, (0, 11, 2)>
- For Node 12, the 3-stars are: <12, (13, 7, 14)>, <12, (13, 12, 7)>, <12, (7, 12, 14)>
- For Node 13, the 3-stars are: <13, (8, 12, 14)>, <13, (8, 13, 12)>, <13, (12, 13, 14)>
- For Node 14, the 3-stars are: <14, (11, 13, 0)>, <14, (11, 14, 0)>, <14, (13, 14, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we have a total of [21] 3-stars.
