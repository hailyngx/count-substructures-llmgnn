Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 11, 4, and node 10
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 10, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 13, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 14, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 11, 12, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 14, 10, 0, 6, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 8, 13, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 0, 12, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 11, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 10, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (6, 10, 13)>
<9, (1, 7, 12)>
<12, (4, 8, 9)>
<13, (2, 8, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
