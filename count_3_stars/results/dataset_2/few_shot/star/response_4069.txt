Node 9 is connected to node 12, 2, 14, 0, 4, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 8, 4, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 13, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 7, 6, 14, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 9, and node 13

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

Starting with the given adjacency list, we see which node satisfies the property of a 3-star, which is to have exactly three edges connecting it to the other nodes.

1. Node 10: Connected to nodes 11, 0, and 8 - <10, (11, 0, 8)>
2. Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, 14, and 13 - <11, (10, 14, 13)>
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 5, and 9 - <2, (7, 5, 9)>
4. Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 13, and 12 - <7, (3, 13, 12)>
5. Node 14: Connected to nodes 10, 11, and 8 - <14, (10, 11, 8)>
6. Node 9: Connected to nodes 14, 13, and 0 - <9, (14, 13, 0)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
