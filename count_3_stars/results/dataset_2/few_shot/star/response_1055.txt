Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have connections to three other nodes, forming a star-like shape with the central node.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 17)>
<4, (7, 0, 16)>
<7, (9, 4, 11)>
<10, (11, 13, 19)>
<5, (3, 15, 12)>
<12, (1, 13, 5)>
<16, (9, 4, 18)>
<0, (6, 4, 18)>
<17, (9, 7, 8)>
<18, (16, 0, 2)>
<19, (10, 15, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
