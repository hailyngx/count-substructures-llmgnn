Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<3, (9, 8, 11)>
<4, (9, 13, 10)>
<5, (12, 11, 14)>
<7, (0, 6, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<10, (9, 4, 13)>
<11, (5, 12, 1)>
<12, (9, 2, 11)>
<13, (4, 7, 10)>
<14, (5, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is equal to the number of unique 3-stars listed above. Counting the unique 3-stars gives us the result: [11].
