Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 6, 14, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 11, 13, 0, 12, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 10, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 14, 12, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 13, 14, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 13, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 12, 2, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 0, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star by looking at each node as the potential central node and finding the nodes connected to it. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 6, 14)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 9)>
<4, (2, 10, 1)>
<5, (10, 11, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 14)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 13, 14)>
<10, (4, 13, 5)>
<11, (3, 0, 5)>
<12, (13, 5, 6)>
<13, (10, 12, 2)>
<14, (1, 5, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars above, we can see that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
