Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 11, and 18. <1, (7, 11, 18)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 21, and 24. <2, (10, 21, 24)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 20, and 29. <4, (12, 20, 29)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 21, and 22. <5, (10, 21, 22)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 14, and 27. <7, (12, 14, 27)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 24, and 29. <8, (18, 24, 29)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 19, and 2. <10, (16, 19, 2)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 20, and 28. <11, (14, 20, 28)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 19, and 22. <13, (16, 19, 22)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 23, and 9. <18, (8, 23, 9)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 22, and 28. <21, (5, 22, 28)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, and 28. <22, (5, 13, 28)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 23, and 2. <24, (8, 23, 2)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 14, and 15. <25, (12, 14, 15)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 29, and 4. <26, (11, 29, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
