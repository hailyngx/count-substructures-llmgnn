Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 6. <1, (7, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 2. <3, (4, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 8. <5, (4, 1, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 1. <7, (0, 8, 1)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 2. <8, (7, 9, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 8. <9, (4, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<1, (7, 3, 6)>, <3, (4, 1, 2)>, <5, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 1)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>
