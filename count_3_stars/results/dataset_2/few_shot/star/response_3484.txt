Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through each node's adjacency list and identify the 3-stars.

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 21 and 28. Not a central node for any 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 3 and 10. Not a central node for any 3-star.

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 21, 10, and 14. <2, (4, 21, 10)>

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 15, 1, 25, and 12. <3, (15, 1, 25)>

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 8, 11, and 2. <4, (7, 8, 11)>

6. Node 5:

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 21, 10)>
<3, (15, 1, 25)>
<4, (7, 8, 11)>
<6, (15, 28, 13)>
<7, (4, 29, 23)>
<8, (4, 12, 26)>
