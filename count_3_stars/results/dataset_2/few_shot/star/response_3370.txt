Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (7, 4, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in total.
