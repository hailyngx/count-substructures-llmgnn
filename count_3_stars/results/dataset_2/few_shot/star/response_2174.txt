Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Find all the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 14, and 8.
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 13, and 10.
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star structure with their neighbors.
   
   For Node 6:
   - Node 9, Node 14, and Node 8 form a 3-star. <6, (9, 14, 8)>
   
   For Node 8:
   - Node 6, Node 13, and Node 10 form a 3-star. <8, (6, 13, 10)>
   
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <6, (9, 14, 8)> and <8, (6, 13, 10)>.
