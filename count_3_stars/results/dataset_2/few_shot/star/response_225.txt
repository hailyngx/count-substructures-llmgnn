Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's consider each node as the central node in turn and find the nodes connected to it. Then, we'll check if those connections create a 3-star pattern. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 11.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 4.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 9.
- This forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 13, 9)>.

Continuing with Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12 and 5.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Moving on to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 12.
- This forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 12)>.

Continuing with Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 14.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 10.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Continuing with Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 13.
- This forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 13, 12)>.

Moving on to Node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to node 8.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1 and 14.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Next, Node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6 and 14.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Continuing with Node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- This forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 9, 11)>.

Finally, Node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4 and 11.
- None of these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (0, 13, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 12)>
<9, (3, 13, 12)>
<13, (3, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
