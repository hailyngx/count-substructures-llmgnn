Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We observe that a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<3, (15, 10, 4)>
<15, (3, 19, 13)>
<13, (15, 12, 2)>
<0, (10, 18, 1)>
<1, (0, 16, 8)>
<2, (13, 17, 14)>
<4, (3, 9, ___)>
<5, (6, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 19, ___)>
<6, (5, 10, ___)>
<7, (17, 16, ___)>
<10, (3, 6, 0)>
<11, (5, 14, ___)>
<12, (13, 16, ___)>
<16, (12, 7, 1)>
<17, (2, 7, ___)>
<18, (13, 0, 10)>
<19, (15, 9, 2)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [16]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
