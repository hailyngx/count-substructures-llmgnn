Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star):
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 2, forming a 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 12, 2)>
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 14, forming a 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (11, 2, 14)>
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 0, forming a 3-star with Node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 8, 0)>
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 13, forming a 3-star with Node 4 as the center: <4, (8, 9, 13)>
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 6, and 14, forming a 3-star with Node 7 as the center: <7, (12, 6, 14)>
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 12, forming a 3-star with Node 8 as the center: <8, (4, 2, 12)>
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 13, forming a 3-star with Node 9 as the center: <9, (4, 7, 13)>
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 13, forming a 3-star with Node 10 as the center: <10, (1, 7, 13)>

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are 7 unique 3-stars as identified above.
