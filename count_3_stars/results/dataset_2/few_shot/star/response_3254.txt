Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 13, 14, 11, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 12, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 11, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 12, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 10, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 13, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 13
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 14, 6, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 14, 7, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 0, and node 10

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0: (5, 13, 14) and (5, 11, 0) and (0, 13, 14)
2. For Node 1: (9, 3, 1) and (9, 11, 1)
3. For Node 2: (3, 7, 2)
4. For Node 3: (9, 1, 3) and (9, 7, 3)
5. For Node 4: (9, 12, 4)
6. For Node 5: (9, 6, 5) and (9, 10, 5)
7. For Node 6: (5, 10, 6) 
8. For Node 7: (13, 6, 7) and (13, 2, 7)
9. For Node 10: (5, 14, 10) 
10. For Node 13: (8, 14, 13)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 13, 14)>, <0, (5, 11, 0)>, <0, (0, 13, 14)>, <1, (9, 3, 1)>, <1, (9, 11, 1)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 3)>, <3, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 12, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 5)>, <5, (9, 10, 5)>, <6, (5, 10, 6)>, <7, (13, 6, 7)>, <7, (13, 2, 7)>, <10, (5, 14, 10)>, <13, (8, 14, 13)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars found, we get [15].
