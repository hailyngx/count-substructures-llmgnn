Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars based on the given edges and adjacency information:

1. Central nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 0
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 0, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 1
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can see that there are 4 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
