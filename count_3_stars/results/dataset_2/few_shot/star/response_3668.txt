Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list each unique 3-star once.

1. Node 13: <13, (2, 20, 7)>
2. Node 2: <2, (13, 29, 19)>
3. Node 20: <20, (13, 2, 0)>
4. Node 3: <3, (22, 11, 7)>
5. Node 1: <1, (10, 4, 12)>
6. Node 21: <21, (26, 18, 29)>
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 24, 17)>
8. Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 24)>
9. Node 18: <18, (21, 19, 25)>
10. Node 11: <11, (15, 3, 27)>
11. Node 14: <14, (9, 4, 25)>
12. Node 15: <15, (20, 11, 16)>
13. Node 17: <17, (24, 23, 7)>
14. Node 25: <25, (18, 28, 16)>
15. Node 26: <26, (21, 28, 5)>
16. Node 27: <27, (11, 7)>
17. Node 22: <22, (0, 3)>
18. Node 4: <4, (1, 14)>
19. Node 10: <10, (1, 29, 20)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
