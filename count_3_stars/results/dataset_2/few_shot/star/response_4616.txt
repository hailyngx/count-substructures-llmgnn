Response:
Let's find the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <0, (5, 9, 10)>
2. <0, (5, 13, 14)>
3. <1, (3, 2, 14)>
4. <1, (3, 7, 11)>
5. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
6. <3, (5, 0, 9)>
7. <3, (5, 6, 13)>
8. <3, (5, 1, 7)>
9. <4, (10, 12, 14)>
10. <8, (9, 10, 13)>
11. <9, (6, 8, 2)>
12. <10, (8, 0, 13)>
13. <10, (8, 4, 12)>
14. <13, (6, 8, 12)>
15. <13, (6, 0, 5)>
16. <14, (1, 4, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
