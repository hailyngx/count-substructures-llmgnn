Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-star patterns for each node that can act as the center. 

Now, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in this graph: 
- Node 11 can form three 3-stars: <11, (16, 7, 29)>, <11, (16, 3, 7)>, and <11, (16, 3, 29)>.
- Node 16 can form one 3-star: <16, (11, 3, 18)>.
- Node 14 can form one 3-star: <14, (17, 6, 13)>.
- Node 17 can form one 3-star: <17, (14, 24, 2)>.
- Node 20 can form one 3-star: <20, (25, 12, 0)>.
- Node 25 can form one 3-star: <25, (20, 24, 0)>.
- Node 4 can form one 3-star: <4, (19, 28, 21)>.
- Node 2 can form one 3-star: <2, (17, 8, 19)>.
- Node 8 can form one 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 26)>.
- Node 26 can form two 3-stars: <26, (8, 19, 23)> and <26, (8, 19, 12)>.
- Node 24 can form one 3-star: <24, (17, 9, 1)>.
- Node 1 can form one 3-star: <1, (0, 13, 24)>.
- Node 5 can form one 3-star: <5, (8, 13, 12)>.
- Node 6 can form one 3-star: <6, (14, 7, 23)>.
- Node 7 can form one 3-star: <7, (11, 9, 15)>.
- Node 9 can form one 3-star: <9, (24, 7, 15)>.
- Node 23 can form one 3-star: <23, (14, 26, 29)>.
- Node 12 can form one 3-star: <12, (20, 26, 22)>.
- Node 19 can form one 3-star: <19, (2, 26, 4)>.
- Node 3 can form one 3-star: <3, (11, 16, 5)>.
- Node 18 can form one 3-star: <18, (16, 10, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
