Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1

Response:
Given the information provided, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<4, (7, 8, 9)> - central node: 4, leaves: 7, 8, 9
<4, (2, 0, 3)> - central node: 4, leaves: 2, 0, 3
<5, (6, 1, 2)> - central node: 5, leaves: 6, 1, 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
