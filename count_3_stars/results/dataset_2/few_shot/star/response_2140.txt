Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can see that the possible 3-stars could involve nodes with only 3 connections since a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on this information, the 3-stars in the graph are:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 16)>
<2, (6, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 15, 17)>
<4, (0, 7, 16)>
<5, (3, 15, 18)>
<6, (1, 9, 10)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 17, 19)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (2, 6, 9)>
<11, (0, 12, 14)>
<12, (11, 18, 18)>
<13, (2, 4, 19)>
<14, (11, 16, 16)>
<15, (1, 3, 17)>
<16, (0, 1, 4)>
<17, (8, 15, 18)>
<18, (5, 12, 17)>
<19, (8, 13, 19)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [20] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
