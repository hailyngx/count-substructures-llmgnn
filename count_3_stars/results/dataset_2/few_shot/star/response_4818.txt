Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them as follows:

<1, (3, 6, 14)>
<2, (4, 13, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 12)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 11, 14)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<10, (1, 3, 0)>
<11, (7, 0)>
<12, (3, 14)>
<13, (2, 7, 1)>
<14, (9, 7, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14].
