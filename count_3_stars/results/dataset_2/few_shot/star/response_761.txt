Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. <0, (5, 9, 4)>
2. <0, (5, 9, 7)>
3. <0, (5, 3, 6)>
4. <0, (9, 8, 2)>
5. <0, (9, 8, 1)>
6. <0, (9, 7, 3)>
7. <1, (9, 6, 2)>
8. <1, (9, 8, 3)>
9. <2, (9, 1, 8)>
10. <3, (4, 7, 0)>
11. <5, (9, 6, 0)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [11].
