Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15 and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to node 15.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 7, 12, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 14 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 19, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 4.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 6, and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 16, 6, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 0, and 4.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 7, and 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 0, 18, and 2.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 14, 12, and 18.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14 and 11.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 16.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 12 and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (15, 13, 1)>
<1, (15, 8, 2)>
<4, (9, 6, 13)>
<5, (9, 18, 10)>
<6, (10, 11, 7)>
<8, (10, 2, 19)>
<12, (16, 6, 19)>
<13, (2, 1, 0)>
<14, (17, 7, 16)>
<15, (3, 18, 0)>
<16, (12, 14, 18)>
