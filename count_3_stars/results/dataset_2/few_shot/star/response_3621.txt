Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can find the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (9, 3, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
