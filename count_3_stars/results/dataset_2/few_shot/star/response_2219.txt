Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 12, 8)>
<1, (8, 16, 14)>
<2, (14, 10, 1)>
<3, (8, 13, 10)>
<4, (20, 3, 17)>
<5, (13, 24, 28)>
<6, (22, 20, 24)>
<7, (25, 23, 17)>
<9, (27, 22, 20)>
<10, (26, 3, 14)>
<11, (27, 23, 21)>
<12, (0, 8, 23)>
<13, (5, 17, 21)>
<14, (2, 10, 1)>
<15, (24, 5, 6)>
<16, (1, 15, 29)>
<17, (13, 7, 4)>
<18, (26, 23, 25)>
<19, (21, 29, 28)>
<20, (9, 4, 6)>
<21, (27, 13, 19)>
<22, (26, 9, 6)>
<23, (18, 7, 12)>
<24, (15, 5, 6)>
<25, (18, 7, 0)>
<26, (18, 22, 10)>
<27, (0, 21, 11)>
<28, (5, 19, 0)>
<29, (13, 16, 19)>
