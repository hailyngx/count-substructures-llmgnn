Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 5, 7, and 9 are the only nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 2

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
There are <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 8, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
