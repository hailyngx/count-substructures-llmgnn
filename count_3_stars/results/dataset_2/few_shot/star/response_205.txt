Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can think about each node as a potential center of a 3-star and then check its connections to form stars. 

Starting from each node, we look for its neighbors and see if there are exactly three neighbors that are not connected to each other. If such a group of nodes exist, then we have found a 3-star with the current node as the center. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
