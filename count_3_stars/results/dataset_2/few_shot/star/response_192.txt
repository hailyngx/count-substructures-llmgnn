Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars present in the graph:

<7, (15, 21, 16)>
<7, (15, 22, 1)>
<7, (15, 16, 1)>
<7, (21, 10, 1)>
<7, (21, 22, 1)>
<7, (16, 2, 25)>
<7, (16, 25, 2)>
<7, (22, 0, 18)>
<7, (22, 18, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 14, 11)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>
<7, (21, 10, 11)>
<7, (21, 10, 29)>
<7, (21, 11, 10)>
<7, (21, 11, 14)>
<7, (21, 10, 29)>

<11, (15, 10, 28)>
<11, (15, 14, 8)>
<11, (15, 10, 21)>
<11, (15, 10, 25)>
<11, (10, 21, 7)>
<11, (10, 28, 14)>
<11, (10, 25, 16)>
<11, (10, 25, 15)>
<11, (10, 28, 20)>
<11, (10, 25, 16)>
<11, (10, 25, 16)>

<14, (1, 11, 28)>
<14, (1, 11, 8)>
<14, (1, 28, 20)>
<14, (11, 28, 20)>

<16, (7, 2, 25)>
<16, (7, 25, 2)>
<16, (2, 26, 15)>
<16, (25, 10, 11)>
<16, (25, 11, 10)>
<16, (25, 10, 15)>

<20, (28, 4, 29)>
<20, (28, 29, 4)>
<20, (28, 11, 14)>
<20, (28, 11, 8)>
<20, (28, 14, 11)>
<20, (28, 8, 11)>
<20, (4, 23, 12)>
<20, (29, 10, 6)>
<20, (29, 6, 10)>
<20, (29, 6, 8)>
<20, (29, 8, 6)>

<22, (7, 0, 18)>

<25, (10, 16, 2)>

<28, (11, 20, 8)>
<28, (11, 14, 1)>
<28, (20, 8, 29)>

<29, (10, 20, 8)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [27].
