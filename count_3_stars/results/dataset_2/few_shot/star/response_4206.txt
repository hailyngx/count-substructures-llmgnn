Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 4, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 8, 6, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 11, 8, 12, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 8, 2, 13, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 10, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 14, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 4, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 6, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 14, 3, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 13

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 10: <10, (0, 6, 1)> and <10, (11, 2, 9)>
- From node 11: <11, (10, 8, 3)>
- From node 4: <4, (12, 8, 9)>
- From node 8: <8, (11, 4, 3)>
- From node 0: <0, (10, 4, 14)>
- From node 2: <2, (10, 8, 12)>
- From node 3: <3, (11, 8, 13)>
- From node 5: <5, (8, 2, 7)>
- From node 1: <1, (10, 8, 6)> and <1, (7, 5, 9)>
- From node 6: <6, (10, 1, 0)>
- From node 7: <7, (14, 5, 1)>
- From node 9: <9, (10, 4, 1)>
- From node 12: <12, (4, 2, 13)>
- From node 13: <13, (14, 3, 12)>
- From node 14: <14, (0, 7, 13)>

There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
