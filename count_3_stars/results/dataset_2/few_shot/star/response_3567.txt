Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For each node in the graph, find the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center:
    - Node 0: <0, (13, 10, 5)>, <0, (13, 9, 0)>
    - Node 1: <1, (8, 13, 7)>
    - Node 2: <2, (3, 11, 9)>
    - Node 3: <3, (8, 11, 14)>
    - Node 4: No 3-star
    - Node 5: <5, (12, 14, 7)>
    - Node 6: <6, (11, 12, 7)>
    - Node 7: <7, (8, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 6, 14)>, <7, (8, 5, 7)>, <7, (8, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 13, 9)>, <7, (12, 5, 14)>
    - Node 8: <8, (13, 12, 7)>, <8, (13, 3, 9)>, <8, (13, 8, 7)>, <8, (3, 11, 2)>
    - Node 9: <9, (13, 3, 0)>, <9, (13, 9, 7)>, <9, (13, 2, 9)>, <9, (11, 3, 2)>
    - Node 10: <10, (12, 0, 4)>
    - Node 11: <11, (3, 9, 6)>, <11, (3, 2, 11)>, <11, (6, 12, 7)>
    - Node 12: <12, (8, 5, 7)>
    - Node 13: <13, (8, 12, 7)>, <13, (8, 3, 9)>, <13, (8, 7, 9)>, <13, (1, 9, 7)>, <13, (9, 3, 2)>
    - Node 14: <14, (3, 7, 5)>, <14, (5, 7, 7)>
  
Count of 3-stars: 20
