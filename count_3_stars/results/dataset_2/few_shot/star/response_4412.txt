Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From Node 0: <0, (6, 11, 12)>
2. From Node 1: <1, (7, 11, 14)>
3. From Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed since it only has two connections.
4. From Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed since it only has two connections.
5. From Node 4: <4, (9, 8, 13)>
6. From Node 5: <5, (12, 10, 14)>
7. From Node 6: <6, (9, 11, 12)>
8. From Node 7: <7, (8, 1, 14)>
9. From Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed since it only has three connections.
10. From Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 11)>
11. From Node 10: <10, (9, 2, 13)>
12. From Node 11: <11, (6, 9, 8)>
13. From Node 12: No additional 3-star can be formed since all possible combinations have been covered when considering other nodes.
14. From Node 13: No 3-stars can be formed since it only has three connections.
15. From Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed since it only has three connections.

By counting the identified 3-stars, we have found a total of 9 unique 3-stars inside <>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
