Response:
Let's start by identifying the central node in each potential 3-star. We do this by finding nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Potential central nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node.

For Node 0: (27, 25, 18)
For Node 1: (4, 11, 10)
For Node 2: (19, 20, 14)
For Node 3: (4, 10, 12)
For Node 5: (19, 11, 16)
For Node 6: (26, 21, 20)
For Node 7: (27, 19, 11)
For Node 9: (17, 11, 23)
For Node 10: (1, 3, 23)
For Node 11: (5, 1, 7) and (9) - Node 11 has four neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
For Node 12: (13, 26, 3) and (14, 20)
For Node 14: (2, 12) and (20)
For Node 16: (21, 5)
For Node 17: (29) - Node 17 has only one neighbor, so it does not form a 3-star.
For Node 18: (0)
For Node 20: (2, 6, 12) and (24)
For Node 23: (21, 28, 9) and (10)
For Node 25: (0, 8, 26) and (15)
For Node 26: (25, 6) and (12)
For Node 28: (22, 24) and (23)
For Node 29: (17, 19, 21)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars from the above results:

<0, (27, 25, 18)>
<1, (4, 11, 10)>
<2, (19, 20, 14)>
<3, (4, 10, 12)>
<5, (19, 11, 16)>
<6, (26, 21, 20)>
<7, (27, 19, 11)>
<9, (17, 11, 23)>
<10, (1, 3, 23)>
<12, (13, 26, 3)>
<12, (14, 20)>
<14, (2, 12)>
<16, (21, 5)>
<20, (2, 6, 12)>
<20, (24)>
<23, (21, 28, 9)>
<23, (10)>
<25, (0, 8, 26)>
<25, (15)>
<26, (25, 6)>
<26, (12)>
<28, (22, 24)>
<28, (23)>
<29, (17, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
