Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that a 3-star is formed when a node has exactly three neighbors connected to it.

By analyzing the graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 11, 13)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 2)>
<6, (5, 12, 2)>
<7, (12, 10, 14)>
<8, (9, 10, 6)>
<10, (7, 8, 14)>
<11, (12, 2, 3)>
<12, (9, 7, 6)>
<13, (5, 11, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [11] 3-stars.
