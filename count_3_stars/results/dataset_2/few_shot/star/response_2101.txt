Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
In this graph, we can identify the 3-stars by checking each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 0, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 4)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
