Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list out all such 3-stars below:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (9, 2, 3)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (9, 7, 3)>
<2, (7, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
