Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 9, 12), (5, 4, 10)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 14), (1, 4, 7), (1, 6, 13)
3. Node 6: (6, 8, 14), (6, 10, 11), (6, 1, 13)
4. Node 7: (7, 2, 8), (7, 3, 10), (7, 1, 9)

So, there are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [12]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (0, 3), (4, 10)>
<1, (2, 14), (4, 7), (6, 13)>
<6, (8, 14), (10, 11), (1, 13)>
<7, (2, 8), (3, 10), (1, 9)>
