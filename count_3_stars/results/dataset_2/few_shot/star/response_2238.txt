Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Here are the steps: 
1. Look for nodes with exactly 3 edges. These can be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. For each node found in step 1, check the neighboring nodes connected to it. If a neighbor of the central node is connected to exactly 2 other nodes (in addition to the central node), then it forms a 3-star.
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start with the process:
1. Nodes with 3 edges: Nodes 20, 25, 26, 28, and 29.
2. Now, we will check the neighbors of these central nodes.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<20, (25, 26, 9)>
<25, (20, 17, 23)>
<26, (20, 16, 17)>
<28, (6, 21, 2)>
<29, (17, 5, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
