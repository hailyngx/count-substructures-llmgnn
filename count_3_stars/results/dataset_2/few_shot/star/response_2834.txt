Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1: Connected to 7, 14, 11
- Node 6: Connected to 4, 5, 2
- Node 9: Connected to 7, 2, 0
- Node 10: Connected to 2, 12, 3
- Node 11: Connected to 6, 0, 13

Now, let's analyze each node to find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 1:
- <1, (7, 14, 11)>
- <1, (7, 11, 10)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (4, 5, 2)>

For Node 9:
- <9, (7, 2, 0)>

For Node 10:
- <10, (2, 12, 3)>

For Node 11:
- <11, (6, 0, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5].
