Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by examining all possible 3-star structures:

1. Find potential central nodes by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors:
    - Nodes 2, 6, and 18 meet this criterion.

2. For each potential central node, identify the adjacent nodes that form 3-stars with it:
    - For node 2: (2, 16, 18, 10), (2, 16, 0, 15), (2, 16, 0, 19)
    - For node 6: (6, 4, 1, 0)
    - For node 18: (18, 14, 3, 8), (18, 14, 2, 10), (18, 14, 2, 3)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (16, 18, 10)>
<2, (16, 0, 15)>
<2, (16, 0, 19)>
<6, (4, 1, 0)>
<18, (14, 3, 8)>
<18, (14, 2, 10)>
<18, (14, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
