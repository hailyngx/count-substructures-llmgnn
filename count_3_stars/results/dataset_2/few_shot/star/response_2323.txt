Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<13, (22, 8, 24)>
<13, (22, 0, 6)>
<22, (13, 28, 21)>
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<9, (5, 14, 0)>
<3, (25, 12, 12)>
<25, (3, 14, 11)>
<8, (13, 7, 7)>
<1, (10, 17, 16)>
<19, (12, 21, 4)>
<0, (13, 9, 13)>
<27, (1, 27, 1)>
<23, (18, 24, 4)>
<4, (19, 23, 15)>
<15, (21, 4, 15)>
<16, (1, 6, 26)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [15].
