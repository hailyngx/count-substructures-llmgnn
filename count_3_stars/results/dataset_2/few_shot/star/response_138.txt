Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph. In a 3-star, there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them:

1. <1, (11, 17, 6)>  
2. <3, (0, 18, 8)>  
3. <6, (8, 1, 16)>  
4. <7, (11, 13, 3)>  
5. <8, (19, 14, 6)>  
6. <9, (4, 17, 7)>  
7. <10, (11, 2, 12)>  
8. <11, (10, 7, 1)>  
9. <12, (10, 2, 18)>  
10. <13, (18, 15, 7)>  
11. <14, (4, 8, 14)>  
12. <15, (0, 13, 6)>  
13. <16, (19, 6, 16)>  
14. <17, (1, 9, 5)>  
15. <18, (12, 3, 13)>  
16. <19, (11, 8, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
