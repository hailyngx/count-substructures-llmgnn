Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have degree 3, meaning it must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following center nodes: Node 1, Node 5, Node 13, and Node 17.

1. For Node 1:
    - (1, 3, 19) - <1, (3, 19, center)>
    - (1, 13, 16) - <1, (13, 16, center)>
    - (1, 0, 11) - <1, (0, 11, center)>

2. For Node 5:
    - (5, 0, 7) - <5, (0, 7, center)>
    - (5, 4, 11) - <5, (4, 11, center)>

3. For Node 13:
    - (13, 14, 15) - <13, (14, 15, center)>
    - (13, 1, 16) - <13, (1, 16, center)>

4. For Node 17:
    - (17, 14, 15) - <17, (14, 15, center)>
    - (17, 6, 18) - <17, (6, 18, center)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
