Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 9, Node 13 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form 3-star graphs with their neighbors.
- Node 2: (2, 4, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 2), (5, 6, 4), (5, 8, 1), (5, 8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 5, 8), (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 7)
- Node 13: (13, 0, 4), (13, 0, 12), (13, 0, 10)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-star graphs.
- Unique 3-star graphs: <2, (4, 5, 2)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 4, 2)>, <5, (8, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <13, (0, 4, 12)>, <13, (0, 10, 12)>
- Total number of 3-star graphs [10] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
