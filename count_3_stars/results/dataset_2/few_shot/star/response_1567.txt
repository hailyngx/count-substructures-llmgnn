Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break this down:

We will go through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
If it is, we will list the 3-star with that node as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.
Finally, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 3, 0)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
