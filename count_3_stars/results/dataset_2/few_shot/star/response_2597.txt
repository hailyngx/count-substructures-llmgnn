Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Based on the identified unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
