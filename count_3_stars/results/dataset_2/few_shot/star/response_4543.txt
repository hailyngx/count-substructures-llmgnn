Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the central node and its leaves can form a 3-star. Let's list them:
   <8, (4, 5, 23)>
   <13, (0, 17, 20)>
   <12, (7, 25, 27)>
   <4, (3, 8, 29)>
   <7, (1, 12, 14)>
   <0, (1, 13, 14)>
   <14, (0, 7, 15)>
   <1, (0, 7, )>
   <27, (2, 25, 28)>
   <3, (4, 11, 19)>
   <26, (2, 11, 20)>
   <23, (8, 15, 28)>
   <20, (0, 17, 26)>
   <11, (3, 5, 26)>
   <17, (13, 15, 20)>
   <10, (21, 22, 29)>
   <5, (8, 11, 22)>
   <15, (14, 17, 18)>
   <9, (2, 11, 24)>
   <22, (5, 6, 21)>
   <25, (8, 24, 27)>
   <18, (3, 15, )>
   <19, (3, 7, 24)>
   <21, (10, 22, 29)>
   <6, (22, )>
   <29, (4, 10,)>
   <2, (27, 9,)>
   <16, ()>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph: [30]
