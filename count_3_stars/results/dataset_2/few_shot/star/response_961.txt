Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and then check if they form a 3-star. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 8
- Node 10

These nodes cannot form 3-stars since they do not have the required number of neighbors. 

Next, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 12, 1)>
<9, (5, 2, 10)>
<4, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<6, (1, 2, 11)>
<12, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (7, 6, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 7 in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
