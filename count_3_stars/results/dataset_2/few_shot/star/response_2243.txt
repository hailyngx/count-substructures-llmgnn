Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The 3-star subgraphs can be identified by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
After carefully analyzing the adjacency list, the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (9, 10, 12)>
<2, (9, 10, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<4, (11, 5, 1)>
<5, (11, 0, 13)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (11, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 10, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<10, (11, 8, 1)>
<11, (6, 10, 7)>
<12, (11, 3, 1)>
<14, (9, 8, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star subgraphs found, we have a total of [13].
