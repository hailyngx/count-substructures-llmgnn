Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors (leaves):
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 23.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 27, 5, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 27 and 20.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 15.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 29 and 19.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 23 is connected to node 0.

2. Based on the above information, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 14, 21 have exactly three neighbors each. We can form 3-stars around these nodes.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed:
- <0, (7, 13, 23)>
- <1, (27, 5, 18)>
- <4, (27, 20, 4)>
- <6, (3, 15, 6)>
- <14, (29, 19, 14)>
- <21, (3, 8, 21)>

4. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars: [6]
