Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 5, 10, 4, and node 0

Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 14, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 12, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 14, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 11, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 5, 4, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (0, 9, 10)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 11)>
3. <1, (4, 9, 11)>
4. <1, (10, 11, 5)>
5. <3, (6, 8, 11)>
6. <3, (7, 8, 11)>
7. <4, (1, 5, 11)>
8. <4, (1, 9, 11)>
9. <4, (5, 6, 11)>
10. <4, (9, 6, 11)>
11. <5, (1, 11, 12)>
12. <5, (4, 11, 6)>
13. <5, (4, 13, 6)>
14. <5, (12, 14, 6)>
15. <6, (3, 8, 14)>
16. <7, (3, 12, 9)>
17. <8, (3, 6, 14)>
18. <9, (1, 4, 11)>
19. <9, (4, 6, 11)>
20. <9, (7, 8, 11)>
21. <12, (5, 14, 4)>
22. <13, (2, 3, 5)>
23. <14, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
