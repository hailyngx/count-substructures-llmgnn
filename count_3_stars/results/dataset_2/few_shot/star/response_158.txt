Response:
The 3-star graph is a simple connected graph where each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices. To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances of 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 10 forms a 3-star <10, (11, 7, 19)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star <16, (4, 12, 29)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star <18, (21, 17, 6)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star <24, (6, 27, 0)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star <26, (8, 19, 10)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star <28, (8, 5, 10)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star <29, (5, 23, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<10, (11, 7, 19)>
<16, (4, 12, 29)>
<18, (21, 17, 6)>
<24, (6, 27, 0)>
<26, (8, 19, 10)>
<28, (8, 5, 10)>
