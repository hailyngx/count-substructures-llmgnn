Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 connections are: 7, 8, 9, and 12. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 7:
- <7, (14, 9, 13)>
- <7, (14, 1, 13)>

For node 8:
- <8, (9, 10, 5)>
- <8, (9, 10, 14)>
- <8, (9, 10, 1)>

For node 9:
- <9, (8, 2, 7)>

For node 12:
- <12, (14, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
