Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars. 
- Node 11 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 14 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors.

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 connections to other nodes and thus can be the center of a 3-star. The only such node is:
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 27.

Now, let's find the 3-stars with the center at Node 28:
- <28, (0, 3, 27)>
  - Node 0 and Node 3 have a common neighbor.
  - Node 0 and Node 27 have a common neighbor.
  - Node 3 and Node 27 have a common neighbor.
  
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is: <28, (0, 3, 27)>.
