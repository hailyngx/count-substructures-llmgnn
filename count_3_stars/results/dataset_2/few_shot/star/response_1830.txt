Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the unique 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list of each node, we can determine the 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (10, 4, 12)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 13, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 14)>
<5, (8, 13, 12)>
<6, (7, 4, 14)>
<7, (11, 6, 10)>
<8, (3, 13, 9)>
<9, (8, 7, 2)>
<10, (8, 0, 7)>
<11, (8, 7, 12)>
<12, (5, 0, 11)>
<13, (3, 8, 5)>
<14, (13, 5, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
