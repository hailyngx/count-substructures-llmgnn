Response:
The central nodes with exactly three linked nodes are: 4, 13, and 14.
  
Let's start by counting the number of 3-stars with the central node 4:

Number of 3-stars with the center node 4: 6

<4, (12, 13, 14)>
<4, (13, 1, 2)>
<4, (13, 2, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 14)>
<4, (1, 13, 2)>
<4, (2, 7, 13)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with the central node 13:

Number of 3-stars with the center node 13: 5

<13, (4, 1, 12)>
<13, (4, 2, 5)>
<13, (4, 5, 12)>
<13, (1, 4, 2)>
<13, (2, 4, 7)>

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars with the central node 14:

Number of 3-stars with the center node 14: 1

<14, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [12]
