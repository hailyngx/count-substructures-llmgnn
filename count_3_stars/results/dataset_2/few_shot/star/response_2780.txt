Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of instances where a node is the center with exactly three connected nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars: 

- From the adjacency list:
	1. Node 9: (26, 29, 10)  
	2. Node 26: (9, 15, 27)  
	3. Node 7: (21, 12, 29)  
	4. Node 21: (7, 11, 29)  
	5. Node 10: (9, 4, 29)  
	6. Node 4: (10, 15, 29)  
	7. Node 15: (26, 22, 1)  
	8. Node 17: (22, 16, 27)  
	9. Node 28: (11, 19, 18)  
	10. Node 18: (28, 16, 19)  
	11. Node 23: (13, 1, 16)  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

Unique 3-stars:  
<9, (26, 29, 10)>  
<26, (9, 15, 27)>  
<7, (21, 12, 29)>  
<21, (7, 11, 29)>  
<10, (9, 4, 29)>  
<4, (10, 15, 29)>  
<15, (26, 22, 1)>  
<17, (22, 16, 27)>  
<28, (11, 19, 18)>  
<18, (28, 16, 19)>  
<23, (13, 1, 16)>
