Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

To identify a 3-star, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency lists:
- Node 0: Connected to 5 nodes (3-stars not possible)
- Node 1: Connected to 3 nodes (3-stars not possible)
- Node 2: Connected to 1 node (3-stars not possible)
- Node 3: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 3)
- Node 4: Connected to 1 node (3-stars not possible)
- Node 5: Connected to 2 nodes (3-stars not possible)
- Node 6: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 6)
- Node 7: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 8: Connected to 3 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 8)
- Node 9: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 9)
- Node 10: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 10)
- Node 11: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 11)
- Node 12: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 12)
- Node 13: Connected to 3 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 13)
- Node 14: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 14)
- Node 15: Connected to 2 nodes (3-stars not possible)
- Node 16: Connected to 4 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 16)
- Node 17: Connected to 3 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 17)
- Node 18: Connected to 2 nodes (3-stars not possible)
- Node 19: Connected to 3 nodes (possible 3-star with center at 19)

By analyzing each node's connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<3, (5, 11, 15)>
<6, (0, 8, 14)>
<8, (11, 16, 6)>
<9, (5, 11, 14)>
<10, (4, 17, 1)>
<11, (9, 3, 12)>
<12, (9, 11, 0)>
<13, (12, 14, 18)>
<14, (9, 13, 6)>
<16, (3, 17, 1)>
<17, (10, 16, 0)>
<19, (10, 0, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
