Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<4, (7, 11, 3)>
<7, (10, 11, 4)>
<6, (8, 5, 18)>
<9, (13)>
<0, (10, 3, 16)>
<2, (8, 1, 17)>
<8, (6, 19, 2)>
<13, (9, 10, 15)>
<5, (6, 18, 8)>
<1, (2, 19, 8)>
<3, (4, 14, 18)>
<19, (8, 15, 14)>
<15, (8, 19, 13)>
<17, (2)>
<18, (5, 3, 13)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
