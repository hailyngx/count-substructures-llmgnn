Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
First, let's identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (degree 3) as potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (9, 3, 0, 8)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (6, 9, 4, 8)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (6, 9, 1, 8, 4)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (3, 7, 8, 2, 5)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (9, 1, 3, 4, 2)

Next, let's consider each potential center node and check if it forms a 3-star:
1. For node 1, the potential 3-stars are:
   - <1, (9, 3, 0)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 0, 8)>
   [3-star count: 3]

2. For node 2, the potential 3-stars are:
   - <2, (6, 9, 4)>
   - <2, (6, 9, 8)>
   - <2, (6, 4, 8)>
   [3-star count: 3]

3. For node 3, the potential 3-stars are:
   - <3, (6, 9, 1)>
   - <3, (6, 9, 8)>
   - <3, (6, 1, 8)>
   [3-star count: 3]

4. For node 4, the potential 3-stars are:
   - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (3, 8, 2)>
   - <4, (3, 8, 5)>
   [3-star count: 3]

5. For node 8, the potential 3-stars are:
   - <8, (9, 1, 3)>
   - <8, (9, 1, 4)>
   - <8, (9, 3, 4)>
   [3-star count: 3]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
