Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (5, 1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (4, 3, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 1, 8)>
4. <3, (9, 4, 7, 1)>
5. <4, (9, 7, 8, 1)>
6. <6, (7, 2, 0)>
7. <7, (9, 4, 3, 6)>
8. <8, (4, 1, 2)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
