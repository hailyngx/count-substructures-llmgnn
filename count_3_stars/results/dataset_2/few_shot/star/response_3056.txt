Response:
1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors each:  
   - Node 0: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 1: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 2: 3 neighbors  
   - Node 3: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 4: 3 neighbors  
   - Node 6: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 7: 3 neighbors  
   - Node 8: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 9: 2 neighbors  
   - Node 10: 2 neighbors  
   - Node 11: 3 neighbors  
   - Node 14: 3 neighbors  
   - Node 15: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 17: 4 neighbors  
   - Node 18: 2 neighbors  
   - Node 19: 4 neighbors  

2. Count the number of 3-stars in the graph:  
   - Let's check each node with exactly 3 neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars.

3. Look for 3-stars around nodes [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 18]:  
   - Node 1: <1, (11, 7, 8)>
   - Node 2: <2, (10, 17, 15)>
   - Node 4: There are no 3-stars with Node 4 as the center since it only has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 7: <7, (11, 6, 8)>
   - Node 10: <10, (11, 2, -)>
   - Node 11: There is already a 3-star found involving Node 11.
   - Node 14: <14, (16, 0, 18)>
   - Node 18: There is already a 3-star found involving Node 18.

4. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:  
    - [5]
