Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (21, 28, 0)>
<2, (29, 11, 25)>
<4, (27, 5, 16)>
<8, (15, 11, 3)>
<9, (10, 25, 7)>
<13, (28, 9, 14)>
<15, (21, 8, 19)>
<19, (29, 15, 20)>
<21, (1, 27, 15)>
<22, (23, 6, 28)>
<25, (2, 23, 27)>
<26, (24, 17)>
<28, (1, 20, 6)>
<29, (2, 7, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
