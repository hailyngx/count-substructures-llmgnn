Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify all possible 3-stars by looking at each node and its connections:
- Node 0: None
- Node 1: None
- Node 2: <2, (16, 5, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (11, 15, 17)>
- Node 4: <4, (16, 19, 9)>
- Node 5: None
- Node 6: <6, (11, 10, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (12, 14, 1)>
- Node 8: <8, (16, 17, 19)>
- Node 9: None
- Node 10: None
- Node 11: <11, (3, 6, 17)>
- Node 12: None
- Node 13: <13, (2, 18, 14)>
- Node 14: <14, (3, 7, 0)>
- Node 15: None
- Node 16: None
- Node 17: <17, (11, 3, 12)>
- Node 18: None
- Node 19: None

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (16, 5, 13)>
- <3, (11, 15, 17)>
- <4, (16, 19, 9)>
- <6, (11, 10, 4)>
- <7, (12, 14, 1)>
- <8, (16, 17, 19)>
- <11, (3, 6, 17)>
- <13, (2, 18, 14)>
- <14, (3, 7, 0)>
- <17, (11, 3, 12)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
