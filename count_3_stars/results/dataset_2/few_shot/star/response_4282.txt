Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations where a node is the center connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (8, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 0)>
<8, (5, 0, 2)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
