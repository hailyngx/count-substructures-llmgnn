Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step.

1. Identify nodes that can be central nodes with exactly three neighboring nodes:
   - Nodes 1, 5, 7, 11, 14, 16, 18, 26 can potentially be central nodes. (They have degree 3)

2. For each potential central node, find the neighboring nodes that form 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: <1, (21, 28, 15)>
   - For Node 5: <5, (8, 27, 14)>
   - For Node 7: <7, (10, 6, 3)>
   - For Node 11: <11, (22, 20, 15)>
   - For Node 14: <14, (20, 27, 5)>
   - For Node 16: <16, (28, 6, 1)>
   - For Node 18: <18, (0, 24, 25)>
   - For Node 26: <26, (24, 29, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars:
<1, (21, 28, 15)>, <5, (8, 27, 14)>, <7, (10, 6, 3)>, <11, (22, 20, 15)>, <16, (28, 6, 1)>, <18, (0, 24, 25)>, <26, (24, 29, 0)>

Therefore, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
