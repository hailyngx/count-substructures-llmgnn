Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars that exist in the given graph: 

<9, (26, 28, 27)>
<26, (9, 6, 4)>
<22, (23, 19, 0)>
<23, (22, 5, 18)>
<27, (9, 12, 16)>
<0, (22, 20, 11)>
<20, (0, 19, 11)>
<28, (9, 21, 13)>
<5, (23, 24, 18)>
<3, (27, 21, 13)>
<1, (17, 14, 8)>
<17, (21, 1, 2)>
<15, (10, 4, 11)>
<6, (26, 23, 24)>
<7, (19, 14, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
