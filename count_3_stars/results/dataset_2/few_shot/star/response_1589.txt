Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
