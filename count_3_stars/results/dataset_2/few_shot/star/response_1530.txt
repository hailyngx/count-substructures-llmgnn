Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find all the unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
