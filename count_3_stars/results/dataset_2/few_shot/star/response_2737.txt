Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
