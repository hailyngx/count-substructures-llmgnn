Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <1, (5, 9, 7)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (9, 4, 0)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
