Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 8) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (8, 15) (8, 9) (13, 17) (13, 11) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 14) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (19, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3: (7, 19, 18)
2. Node 5: (9, 2, 4)
3. Node 7: (12, 6, 10)
4. Node 9: (15, 8, 12)
5. Node 14: (10, 16, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [5]
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <3, (7, 19, 18)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <7, (12, 6, 10)>, <9, (15, 8, 12)>, <14, (10, 16, 2)>
