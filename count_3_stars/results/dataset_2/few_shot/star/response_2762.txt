Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 15, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 15, 12)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 12)>
4. <3, (5, 12, 16)>
5. <4, (8, 2, 19)>
6. <5, (11, 14, 3)>
7. <6, (12, 16, 2)>
8. <7, (10, 19, 15)>
9. <8, (11, 4,  )>
10. <9, (0, 14, )>
11. <10, (11, 14, 7)>
12. <11, (18, 5, 13)>
13. <12, (16, 6, 1)>
14. <13, (11, 16, )>
15. <14, (5, 10, 9)>
16. <15, (1, 0, 7)>
17. <16, (19, 13, 12)>
18. <17, (19, 7, )>
19. <18, (1, 11, )>
20. <19, (4, 7, 17)>

Since there are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
