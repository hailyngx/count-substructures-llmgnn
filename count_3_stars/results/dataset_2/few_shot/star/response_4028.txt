Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

From the adjacency list, we have the following connections involving each node:

- Node 0: (14, 16, 15), (0, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 18)
- Node 2: (7, 16, 11), (2, 5)
- Node 3: (1, 16)
- Node 4: (11, 17)
- Node 5: (11, 2), (5, 12)
- Node 6: (10)
- Node 7: (11, 2), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (19)
- Node 9: (7, 0), (9, 14)
- Node 10: (17, 6), (10, 13)
- Node 11: (4, 7, 5), (11, 2)
- Node 12: (19, 5), (12, 18)
- Node 13: (10, 17)
- Node 14: (0, 9), (14, 15)
- Node 15: (17, 0), (14, 15)
- Node 16: (3, 0, 19, 18), (16, 2)
- Node 17: (4, 10, 13, 15), (17, 18)
- Node 18: (1, 17, 16), (18, 12)
- Node 19: (8, 16), (19, 12)

Let's count and list the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (14, 16, 15)>
- <1, (3, 18, 17)>
- <2, (7, 16, 11)>
- <3, (1, 16, 0)>
- <4, (11, 17, 5)>
- <5, (11, 2, 12)>
- <6, (10, 17, 13)>
- <7, (11, 2, 9)>
- <8, (19, 16, 12)>
- <9, (7, 0, 14)>
- <10, (17, 6, 13)>
- <11, (4, 7, 5)>
- <12, (19, 5, 18)>
- <13, (10, 17, 4)>
- <14, (0, 9, 15)>
- <15, (17, 0, 14)>
- <16, (3, 0, 19)>
- <17, (4, 10, 13)>
- <18, (1, 17, 12)>
- <19, (8, 16, 12)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
