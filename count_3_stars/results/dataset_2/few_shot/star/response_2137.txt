Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star configuration. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (7, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 0)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 9, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
