Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 13, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 11, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 10, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Observing the adjacency list, we can determine the 3-star combinations. Here they are:

<0, (9, 7, 12)>
<1, (9, 5, 6)>
<2, (10, 12, 14)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<8, (14, 12, 2)>
<9, (10, 5, 3)>
<10, (9, 2, 5)>
<11, (14, 7, 4)>
<12, (2, 8, 14)>
<13, (1, 12, 4)>
<14, (2, 8, 12)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
