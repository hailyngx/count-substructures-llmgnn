Response:
There are several 3-star structures in this graph. Let's identify them step by step:
1. Node 0 with neighbors 4, 14, 21 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 14, 21)>
2. Node 0 with neighbors 4, 1, and 14 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 1, 14)>
3. Node 0 with neighbors 4, 21, and 1 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 21, 1)>
4. Node 1 with neighbors 9, 0, and 6 forms a 3-star: <1, (9, 0, 6)>
5. Node 2 with neighbors 19, 6, and 20 forms a 3-star: <2, (19, 6, 20)>
6. Node 4 with neighbors 29, 18, and 10 forms a 3-star: <4, (29, 18, 10)>
7. Node 8 with neighbors 27, 16, 3 forms a 3-star: <8, (27, 16, 3)>
8. Node 11 with neighbors 9, 17, and 1 forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 17, 1)>
9. Node 12 with neighbors 17, 19, and 6 forms a 3-star: <12, (17, 19, 6)>
10. Node 15 with neighbors 20, 21, and 27 forms a 3-star: <15, (20, 21, 27)>
11. Node 16 with neighbors 7, 8, and 18 forms a 3-star: <16, (7, 8, 18)>
12. Node 17 with neighbors 23, 28, and 12 forms a 3-star: <17, (23, 28, 12)>
13. Node 19 with neighbors 26, 2, and 13 forms a 3-star: <19, (26, 2, 13)>
14. Node 20 with neighbors 15, 24, and 5 forms a 3-star: <20, (15, 24, 5)>
15. Node 27 with neighbors 21, 22, and 6 forms a 3-star: <27, (21, 22, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
