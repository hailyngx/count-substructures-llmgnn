Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0: 3-stars <0, (9, 4, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 4)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- For Node 1: 3-star <1, (9, 3, 6)>
- For Node 2: 3-stars <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- For Node 3: No 3-star as a center node
- For Node 4: 3-star <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- For Node 5: 3-star <5, (8, 9, 4)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star as a center node
- For Node 7: No 3-star as a center node
- For Node 8: 3-star <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 4, 2)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 6)>
- For Node 9: 3-stars <9, (5, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
