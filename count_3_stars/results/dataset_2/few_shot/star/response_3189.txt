Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors). Then, we check each central node's neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration.

In this graph:
- Node 0, 6, and 9 are not central nodes since they each have less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1, 3, 5, and 8 are the central nodes because they each have 3 neighbors.

Now, let's find the 3-stars for each central node:
1. Central Node 1: 
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 3, 2, 8
   - 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>

2. Central Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 2
   - 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <3, (7, 1, 2)>

3. Central Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 9, 8, 1, 0
   - 3-stars: <5, (9, 1, 8)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (1, 8, 0)>

4. Central Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 5, 4, 1, 2, 0
   - 3-stars: <8, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 9, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 3, 2)>, 
<1, (9, 3, 2)>, 
<1, (3, 2, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 7, 1)>, 
<3, (4, 7, 2)>, 
<3, (7, 1, 2)>, 
<5, (9, 1, 8)>, 
<5, (9, 8, 0)>, 
<5, (1, 8, 0)>, 
<8, (5, 1, 0)>, 
<8, (5, 2, 0)>, 
<8, (4, 1, 2)>.
