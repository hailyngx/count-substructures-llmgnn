Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes in a 3-star can be any node that has exactly 3 neighbors. From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes are: nodes 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19, 22, and 26.

Let's list out the 3-stars using each of these possible central nodes:
<6, (8, 24, 14)>
<10, (4, 24, 29)>
<12, (1, 13, 17)>
<16, (15, 21, 4)>
<18, (11, 17, 20)>
<19, (1, 7, 13)>
<22, (11, 27, 22)>
<26, (3, 27, 26)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
