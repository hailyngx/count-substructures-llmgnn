Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list given:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 2

This means there are two 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (5, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
