Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step-by-step.

1. Analyze the adjacency list for each node to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (6, 9, 7, 12).
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (13, 4, 12).
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 10, 11, 8).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (9, 14, 13).
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 13, 5).
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (6, 10, 4, 7).
- Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 5, 7, 12, 0).
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes (6, 12, 0, 5).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes (11, 2, 14).
- Node 9 is connected to 6 other nodes (6, 2, 14, 10, 3, 0).
- Node 10 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 11, 2, 5).
- Node 11 is connected to 5 other nodes (10, 14, 8, 12, 2).
- Node 12 is connected to 5 other nodes (6, 1, 11, 7, 0).
- Node 13 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 3, 4).
- Node 14 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 3, 11, 8).

2. Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 12, 0)>
<9, (6, 10, 2)>
<10, (9, 2, 5)>
<11, (10, 14, 8)>
<12, (6, 1, 7)>
<1, (13, 4, 12)>
<4, (1, 13, 5)>
<13, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (9, 14, 13)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]
