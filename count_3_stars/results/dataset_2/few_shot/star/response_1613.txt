Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0**: No 3-star configuration.

2. **Node 1**: <1, (7, 9, 16)>, <1, (6, 10, 19)>

3. **Node 2**: <2, (17, 11, 19)>, <2, (10, 13, 17)>

4. **Node 3**: <3, (11, 14, 16)>, <3, (15, 7, 14)>

5. **Node 4**: No 3-star configuration.

6. **Node 5**: No 3-star configuration.

7. **Node 6**: <6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (0, 1, 13)>

8. **Node 7**: No 3-star configuration.

9. **Node 8**: <8, (4, 14, 18)>, <8, (14, 18, 11)>

10. **Node 9**: No 3-star configuration.

11. **Node 10**: <10, (19, 1, 2)>, <10, (1, 2, 13)>

12. **Node 11**: No 3-star configuration.

13. **Node 12**: No 3-star configuration.

14. **Node 13**: No 3-star configuration.

15. **Node 14**: No 3-star configuration.

16. **Node 15**: No 3-star configuration.

17. **Node 16**: No 3-star configuration.

18. **Node 17**: No 3-star configuration.

19. **Node 18**: No 3-star configuration.

20. **Node 19**: No 3-star configuration.

After going through all nodes, the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (7, 9, 16)>, <1, (6, 10, 19)>, 
<2, (17, 11, 19)>, <2, (10, 13, 17)>, 
<3, (11, 14, 16)>, <3, (15, 7, 14)>, 
<6, (7, 9, 13)>, <6, (0, 1, 13)>, 
<8, (4, 14, 18)>, <8, (14, 18, 11)>, 
<10, (19, 1, 2)>, <10, (1, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
