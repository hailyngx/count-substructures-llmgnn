Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<0, (11, 28, 22)>
<1, (9, 6, 19)>
<2, (15, 25, 28)>
<3, (6, 13, 23)>
<4, (19)>
<5, (11)>
<6, (20, 1, 3)>
<7, (10, 24, 8)>
<8, (15, 27, 24)>
<9, (21, 14, 20)>
<10, (17)>
<11, (5)>
<12, (1, 2, 16)>
<13, (3, 12, 23)>
<14, (9, 17, 18)>
<15, (27, 8, 2)>
<16, (19)>
<17, (14)>
<18, (14)>
<19, (27, 1, 4)>
<20, (21, 9)>
<21, (29, 28)>
<22, (26)>
<23, (13, 14, 28)>
<24, (18, 14)>
<25, (26)>
<26, (25)>
<27, (19, 8)>
<28, (0, 2, 23)>
<29, (21, 23)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[29]
