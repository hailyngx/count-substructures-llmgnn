Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list provided for each node, we can determine the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (7, 3, 11)>
<1, (8, 13, 2)>
<2, (7, 11, 0)>
<3, (11, 0, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<5, (3, 2, 12)>
<6, (11, 12, 14)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<8, (4, 9, 14)>
<9, (7, 8, 11)>
<10, (4, 7)>
<11, (3, 14, 0)>
<12, (5, 13, 2)>
<13, (12, 1, 14)>
<14, (8, 11, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14].
