Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: Connected to 8, 3, 10
- Node 9: Connected to 8, 13, 0
- Node 1: Connected to 6, 10, 0
- Node 2: Connected to 7, 8, 12
- Node 4: Connected to 10, 14, 11

2. Count the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For Node 5: <5, (8, 3, 10)>
- For Node 9: <9, (8, 13, 0)>
- For Node 1: <1, (6, 10, 0)>
- For Node 2: <2, (7, 8, 12)>
- For Node 4: <4, (10, 14, 11)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
