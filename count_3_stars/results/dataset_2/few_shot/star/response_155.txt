Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 13, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 12, 5, 10, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 12, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, 11, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 10, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 10, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 9, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 13, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 6, 14, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, 2, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 12, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 11

Response:
In this graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, the 3-star graph structures are as follows:

<3, (13, 12, 9)>
<3, (13, 12, 8)>
<1, (0, 13, 8)>
<1, (0, 13, 9)>
<1, (0, 13, 12)>
<1, (2, 4, 12)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 10)>
<1, (5, 7, 11)>
<1, (11, 4, 6)>
<1, (11, 4, 9)>
<1, (11, 4, 2)>
<1, (14, 11, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
