Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's list down the 3-star patterns in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 3)>
<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<0, (5, 2, 4)>
<0, (5, 2, 6)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 0)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 3)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 2)>
<5, (7, 4, 6)>
<5, (7, 4, 2)>
<5, (7, 4, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (7, 4, 5)>
<6, (7, 4, 2)>
<6, (7, 4, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 2)>

After listing all the unique 3-star patterns, we can count the total number of 3-stars, which is the number of unique patterns. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
