Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be identified by finding nodes that have exactly three edges emanating from them. Let's list the 3-stars below:

<9, (6, 17, 16)>
<27, (12, 18, 7)>
<4, (25, 24, 20)>
<13, (24, 5, 16)>
<6, (9, 17, 18)>
<14, (17, 7, 20)>
<18, (6, 27, 0)>
<28, (5, 8, 19)>
<12, (9, 27, 2)>
<10, (13, 4, 16)>
<26, (1, 8, 0)>
