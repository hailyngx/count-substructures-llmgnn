Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (7, 13, 2)>
   
2. Node 1:
   - <1, (9, 15, 14)>
   
3. Node 2:
   - <2, (9, 10, 0)>
   
4. Node 4:
   - <4, (16, 8, 13)>
   
5. Node 5:
   - <5, (7, 18, 14)>
   
6. Node 6:
   - <6, (9, 18, 12)>
   
7. Node 7:
   - <7, (8, 0, 5)>
   
8. Node 8:
   - <8, (10, 4, 18)>
   
9. Node 9:
   - <9, (11, 6, 2)>
   
10. Node 11:
    - <11, (16, 9, 17)>
    
11. Node 12:
    - <12, (6, 17, 19)>
    
12. Node 13:
    - <13, (4, 0, 18)>
    
13. Node 14:
    - <14, (16, 1, 5)>
    
14. Node 15:
    - <15, (17, 1)>
    
15. Node 16:
    - <16, (11, 4, 14)>
    
16. Node 17:
    - <17, (11, 12, 15)>
    
17. Node 18:
    - <18, (8, 6, 5)>
    
18. Node 19:
    - <19, (16, 3, 12)>
