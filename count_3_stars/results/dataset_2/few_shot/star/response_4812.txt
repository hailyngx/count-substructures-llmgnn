This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7)

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-stars:
  - <9, (5, 6, 2)>
  - <6, (9, 5, 1)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 0)>
  - <8, (4, 2, 3)>
  - <0, (9, 6, 7)>
  - <7, (9, 8, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. We can see that there are 6 unique 3-stars identified above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 0)>
