Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node one by one:

- Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but they are not forming a 3-star.

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5. <1, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 2 is a part of two 3-stars:
  <2, (1, 3, 9)>
  <2, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6. <3, (2, 4, 6)>

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 7, and 5. <4, (8, 7, 5)>

- Node 5 is not a part of any 3-star.

- Node 6 is not a part of any 3-star.

- Node 7 is not a part of any 3-star.

- Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star.

- Node 9 is not a part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
