Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

From the given list of edges and adjacency list, we identify the following 3-stars:
1. $<0, (6, 9, 7)>$
2. $<1, (9, 4, 7)>$
3. $<2, (6, 9, 3)>$
4. $<3, (4, 1, 2)>$
5. $<4, (6, 8, 5)>$
6. $<5, (4, 7, 3)>$
7. $<6, (7, 2, 4)>$
8. $<7, (6, 9, 0)>$
9. $<8, (4, 1)>$
10. $<9, (2, 1, 7)>$

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [10].
