Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 4)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 3)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 9, 1)>
<5, (4, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
