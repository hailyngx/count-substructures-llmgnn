Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given graph, it seems like Node 9, Node 5, and Node 2 are potential central nodes for 3-stars because they each have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

1. For Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 2)> and <9, (5, 6, 7)>
   
2. For Node 5: <5, (9, 8, 7)> and <5, (9, 8, 5)>
 
3. For Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 8)> and <2, (9, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<List of 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>]
