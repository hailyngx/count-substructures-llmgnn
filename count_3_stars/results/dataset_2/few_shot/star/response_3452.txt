Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <11, (16, 13, 5)>
2. <11, (16, 2, 29)>
3. <11, (13, 11, 29)>
4. <16, (11, 7, 4)>
5. <16, (7, 16, 4)>
6. <4, (16, 7, 28)>
7. <4, (7, 16, 1)>
8. <7, (16, 4, 9)>
9. <18, (9, 23, 17)>
10. <18, (23, 5, 8)>
11. <22, (2, 28, 21)>
12. <5, (11, 23, 29)>
13. <13, (11, 29, 13)>
14. <24, (26, 6, 17)>
15. <26, (24, 20, 25)>
16. <28, (4, 2, 21)>
17. <8, (18, 21, 25)>
18. <9, (7, 18, 19)>
19. <10, (27, 10, 17)>
20. <15, (4, 6, 15)>
21. <21, (8, 25, 2)>
22. <3, (6, 19, 3)>
23. <14, (12, 0, 14)>
24. <1, (4, 20, 1)>
25. <0, (21, 2, 12)>
26. <19, (9, 17, 3)>
27. <23, (18, 5, 23)>
28. <27, (10, 17, 27)>
29. <12, (19, 14, 0)>

There are a total of 29 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
