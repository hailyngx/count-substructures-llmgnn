Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For each node, go through its adjacency list and check if there are any 3-stars centered at that node.
   
2. List all the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (27, 14, 19)>
<1, (17, 4, 19)>
<2, (18, 24, 25)>
<3, (22, 5, 25)>
<4, (22, 1, 15)>
<5, (8, 17, 25)>
<6, (27, 25, 12)>
<7, (8, 11, 24)>
<8, (23, 5, 12)>
<9, (14, 21, 11)>
<10, (13)>
<11, (28, 9, 12)>
<12, (8, 11, 15)>
<13, (23, 10, 6)>
<14, (0, 9, 24)>
<15, (23, 12, 4)>
<16, (18, 26, 9)>
<17, (23, 1, 19)>
<18, (2, 16)>
<19, (0, 21, 17)>
<20, (24)>
<21, (9, 19)>
<22, (4, 25, 3)>
<23, (8, 17, 13)>
<24, (2, 14, 20)>
<25, (2, 29, 22)>
<26, (28, 16)>
<27, (0, 6)>
