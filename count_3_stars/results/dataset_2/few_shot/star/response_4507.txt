Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern) and determine the center and the leaves of each 3-star.

After analyzing the graph data provided, the 3-stars in the given graph can be represented as follows:
1. <1, (2, 26, 11)>
2. <2, (18, 1, 26)>
3. <3, (25, 20, 9)>
4. <5, (25, 18, 29)>
5. <8, (12, 5, 22)>
6. <10, (18, 24, 19)>
7. <11, (1, 6, 9)>
8. <12, (25, 22, 8)>
9. <14, (1, 6, 28)>
10. <17, (29, 28, 22)>
11. <18, (25, 2, 5)>
12. <19, (29, 10, 5)>
13. <20, (3, 21, 18)>
14. <23, (9, 15, 16)>
15. <24, (7, 26, 27)>

It appears that there are 15 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
