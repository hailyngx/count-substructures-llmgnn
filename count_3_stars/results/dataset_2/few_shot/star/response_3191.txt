Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star has only one central node, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Central nodes: 1, 11, 18

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
1: 4, 2, 5, 18
11: 13, 15
18: 8, 0, 1

Now, we can construct the 3-stars:
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (4, 2, 18)>
<1, (4, 5, 18)>
<1, (2, 5, 18)>
<11, (13, 15)>
<18, (8, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
