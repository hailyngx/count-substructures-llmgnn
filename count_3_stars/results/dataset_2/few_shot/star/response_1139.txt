Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are 20 nodes in the graph. For each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (10, 13, 16)>
<1, (4, 7, 18)>
<2, (5, 17, 19)>
<3, (4, 6, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 19)>
<6, (3, 15, 16)>
<7, (1, 4, 19)>
<8, (9)>
<9, (8, 12)>
<10, (0, 11)>
<11, (10, 17, 19)>
<12, (4, 5, 9)>
<13, (0, 3, 16)>
<14, (7)>
<15, (6)>
<16, (13, 18, 6)>
<17, (11, 18, 19)>
<18, (1, 16, 17, 19)>
<19, (5, 11, 17, 18)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
