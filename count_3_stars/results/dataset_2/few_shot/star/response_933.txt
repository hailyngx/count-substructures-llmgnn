Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The central node '0' has three leaves: 6, 9, and 4. 
The central node '1' has three leaves: 2, 4, and 7. 
The central node '2' has three leaves: 1, 8, and 5. 
The central node '3' does not form a 3-star since it has only two neighbors. 
The central node '4' has three leaves: 1, 3, and 5. 
The central node '5' has three leaves: 4, 6, and 7. 
The central node '6' has three leaves: 9, 5, and 7. 
The central node '7' has three leaves: 6, 9, and 5. 
The central node '8' has three leaves: 6, 9, and 4. 
The central node '9' has three leaves: 6, 8, and 7. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find there are 9 of them.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
