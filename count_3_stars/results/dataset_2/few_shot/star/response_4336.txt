Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 8, 4)>
2. <1, (4, 3, 0)>
3. <2, (4, 8, 0)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 6)>
5. <4, (5, 0, 1)>
6. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (5, 9, 3)>
8. <7, (9, 8, 0)>
9. <8, (5, 9, 7)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
