Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
The given graph consists of 10 nodes and 40 edges. 

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all occurrences where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to identify the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the 3-stars are as follows:

<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
