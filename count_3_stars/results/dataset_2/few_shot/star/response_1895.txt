Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star by examining its neighbors.
- A 3-star is formed when the center node has exactly three neighbors connected only to the center and no other neighbors.

Identifying 3-stars:
- From node 0: (0, 18, 14, 8), (0, 18, 14, 1)
- From node 1: (1, 0, 8, 13)
- From node 2: (2, 7, 19, 6)
- From node 3: (3, 14, 6, 15)
- From node 4: (4, 12, 8, 7)
- From node 5: (5, 10, 11, 6)
- From node 6: (6, 15, 3, 12), (6, 15, 11, 5), (6, 15, 12, 4)
- From node 9: (9, 16, 19, 7), (9, 16, 10, 7)
- From node 10: (10, 15, 7, 5), (10, 15, 9, 7)
- From node 11: (11, 5, 6, 1)
- From node 12: (12, 15, 6, 4)
- From node 14: (14, 3, 15, 6), (14, 17, 0, 18)
- From node 15: (15, 10, 6, 12)
- From node 16: (16, 19, 2, 9)
- From node 18: (18, 14, 0, 8)
