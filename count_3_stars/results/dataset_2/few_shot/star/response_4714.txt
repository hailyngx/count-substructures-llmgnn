Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given information, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (9, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (5, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 3)>
6. <5, (9, 1, 4)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 0)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 3)>
9. <8, (7, 2, 0)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
