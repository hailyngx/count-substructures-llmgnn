Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are 30 nodes and 90 edges. Each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes.

Checking each node:

1. For Node 0: No 3-star exists since it has only one edge.
2. For Node 1: One 3-star found: <1, (6, 28, 9)>
3. For Node 2: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
4. For Node 3: No 3-star exists since it has only one edge.
5. For Node 4: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
6. For Node 5: One 3-star found: <5, (22, 16, 11)>
7. For Node 6: One 3-star found: <6, (1, 23, 8)>
8. For Node 7: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
9. For Node 8: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
10. For Node 9: One 3-star found: <9, (1, 23, 20)>
11. For Node 10: No 3-star exists since it has only one edge.
12. For Node 11: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
13. For Node 12: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
14. For Node 13: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
15. For Node 14: One 3-star found: <14, (12, 19, 29)>
16. For Node 15: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
17. For Node 16: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
18. For Node 17: No 3-star exists since it has only three edges, but one is duplicated.
19. For Node 18: No 3-star exists since it has only one edge.
20. For Node 19: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
21. For Node 20: One 3-star found: <20, (23, 26, 17)>
22. For Node 21: One 3-star found: <21, (13, 25, 27)>
23. For Node 22: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
24. For Node 23: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
25. For Node 24: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
26. For Node 25: No 3-star exists since it has only one edge.
27. For Node 26: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
28. For Node 27: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.
29. For Node 28: One 3-star found: <28, (12, 7, 27)>
30. For Node 29: No 3-star exists since it has only two edges.

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 28, 9)>, <5, (22, 16, 11)>, <6, (1, 23, 8)>, <14, (12, 19, 29)>
