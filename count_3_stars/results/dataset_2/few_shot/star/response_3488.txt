Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes act as the center of a 3-star subgraph:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 2
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 8, 4, and 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 3, and 4
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 1, and 2
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 11, and 14 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 1, and 5
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 11, 13, and 0
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 11, 13, and 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 10, 13, and 2
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 10, 5, and 12

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 3, 2)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 9 as the center: <9, (8, 4, 7)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (6, 3, 4)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (6, 1, 2)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 8 as the center: <8, (9, 11, 14)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 4 as the center: <4, (9, 1, 5)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 12 as the center: <12, (11, 13, 0)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 10 as the center: <10, (11, 13, 5)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 5 as the center: <5, (10, 13, 2)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with Node 13 as the center: <13, (10, 5, 12)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
