Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (5)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
