Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. 3-star with center node 6: <6, (9, 5, 14)>
2. 3-star with center node 9: <9, (6, 11, 10)>
3. 3-star with center node 1: <1, (14, 7, 6)>
4. 3-star with center node 4: <4, (8, 10, 5)>
5. 3-star with center node 5: <5, (6, 4, 2)>
6. 3-star with center node 11: <11, (9, 3, 5)>
7. 3-star with center node 2: <2, (6, 5, 12)>
8. 3-star with center node 12: <12, (8, 5, 11)>
9. 3-star with center node 14: <14, (6, 1, 11)>
10. 3-star with center node 7: <7, (6, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
