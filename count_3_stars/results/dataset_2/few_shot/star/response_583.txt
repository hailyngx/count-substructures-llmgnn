Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected by an edge to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these central nodes, find the three other nodes that are connected to it by an edge.

Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and identify the 3-stars:

- From node 0: <0, (9, 1, 3)> and <0, (9, 1, 2)>
- From node 1: <1, (7, 0, 8)>
- From node 2: No 3-stars
- From node 3: No 3-stars
- From node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 9, 3)>
- From node 7: No 3-stars
- From node 8: <8, (5, 1, 3)>
- From node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph is:
<0, (9, 1, 3)>, <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, and <6, (5, 9, 3)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [6]
