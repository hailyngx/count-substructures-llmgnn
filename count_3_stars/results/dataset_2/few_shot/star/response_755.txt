Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Those central nodes will form the center of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 10
- Node 13

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: <0, (6, 7, 10)> and <0, (3, 11, 10)>
- For Node 1: <1, (8, 5, 2)> and <1, (0, 5, 2)> and <1, (0, 8, 2)>
- For Node 3: <3, (9, 12, 11)>
- For Node 4: <4, (9, 5, 14)>
- For Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 12)>
- For Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 11)>
- For Node 7: <7, (6, 12, 0)>
- For Node 8: <8, (5, 10, 1)>
- For Node 10: <10, (9, 8, 0)>
- For Node 13: <13, (14, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
