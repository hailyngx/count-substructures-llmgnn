Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
