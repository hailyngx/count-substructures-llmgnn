Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and then form a 3-star with those neighbors.

Inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we identify the following nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 3 and 12.
- Node 13 has neighbors 14 and 17.
- Node 15 has neighbors 16 and 17.
- Node 18 has neighbor 8.

Let's count the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. For Node 1: (1, (3, 12, 1))
2. For Node 13: (13, (14, 17, 13))
3. For Node 15: (15, (16, 17, 15))
4. For Node 18: (18, (8, 18, 16))

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
