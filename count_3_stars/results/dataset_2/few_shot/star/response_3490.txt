Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
