Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we can count the number of unique 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with three connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 14, 16)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 11, 4)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 7, 9, 18)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 14, 15, 11)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 10, 17, 7)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 5, 16, 6)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 10, 19, 15)
- Node 19 (connected to nodes 18, 4, 3)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[8]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 14, 16)>
<2, (5, 11, 4)>
<3, (7, 9, 18)>
<6, (14, 15, 11)>
<12, (10, 17, 7)>
<15, (5, 16, 6)>
<18, (10, 19, 15)>
<19, (18, 4, 3)>
