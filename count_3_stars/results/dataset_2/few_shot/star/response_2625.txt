Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 3, -)>
<5, (2, 8, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 8, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 7, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 7, -)>

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 7, 8)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
