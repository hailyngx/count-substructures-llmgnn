Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Based on the given graph and its adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (6, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (8, 2, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (8, 7, 5)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (8, 9, 3)>

Therefore, there are **6** unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is **[6]**.
