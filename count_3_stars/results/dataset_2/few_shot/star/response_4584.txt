Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors and counting how many such configurations exist. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 13, 22, and 28)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 3, 14, and 18)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 16, and 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 19, 27, and 23)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 21, 0, and 9)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 7, 18, and 16)
- Node 24 (connected to nodes 13, 12, and 10)
- Node 28 (connected to nodes 0, 18, and 28)

2. Counting the number of 3-stars:
- Based on the nodes identified above, we have found 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (13, 22, 28)>
<1, (3, 14, 18)>
<2, (5, 16, 9)>
<6, (19, 27, 23)>
<11, (21, 0, 9)>
<15, (7, 18, 16)>
<24, (13, 12, 10)>
