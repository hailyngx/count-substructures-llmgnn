Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by looking at each node and counting how many 3-stars it is a part of. Since a 3-star is defined by a central node connected to 3 leaves, we can determine this by finding nodes with at least 3 edges and calculating the combinations of its neighbors taken 3 at a time.

Looking at the adjacency list, nodes that have at least 3 connections are:
- Node 3 (connected to 4 nodes)
- Node 5 (connected to 4 nodes)
- Node 8 (connected to 4 nodes)
- Node 9 (connected to 4 nodes)
- Node 13 (connected to 5 nodes)
- Node 15 (connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 16 (connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 17 (connected to 5 nodes)
- Node 19 (connected to 4 nodes)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 13: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 15: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 16: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 17: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 19: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 42$.

So, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (15, 2, 12)>
<5, (7, 12, 19)>
<8, (3, 11, 17)>
<9, (0, 1, 13)>
<13, (0, 9, 18)>
<15, (3, 1, 16)>
<16, (15, 1, 17)>
<17, (7, 4, 8)>
<19, (4, 5, 13)>
