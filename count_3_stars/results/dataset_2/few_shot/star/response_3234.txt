Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 29, 4)>
<0, (9, 4, 17)>
<0, (9, 4, 18)>
<1, (11, 14, 10)>
<2, (29, 3, 14)>
<3, (2, 20, 17)>
<4, (22, 0, 15)>
<7, (12, 13, 24)>
<8, (12, 24, 20)>
<8, (12, 24, 19)>
<8, (12, 24, 14)>
<9, (26, 22, 27)>
<15, (16, 19, 25)>
<22, (26, 4, 11)>
<23, (20, 17, 18)>
<24, (26, 8, 13)>
<27, (29, 25, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
