Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list and edge list provided, we can identify pairs of nodes that have a direct edge between them. To form a 3-star, we need to find a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 15, 20)>
<0, (3, 15, 21)>
<0, (3, 20, 21)>
<0, (15, 5, 10)>
<4, (25, 27, 13)>
<5, (9, 18, 10)>
<6, (22, 23, 28)>
<7, (1, 19, 20)>
<8, (10, 11, 24)>
<9, (5, 26, 29)>
<14, (18, 19, 20)>
<18, (2, 25, 14)>
<19, (7, 14, 22)>
<20, (1, 2, 14)>
<21, (0, 13, 21)>
<22, (7, 10, 28)>
<23, (6, 26, 29)>
<24, (8, 26, 29)>
<25, (3, 4, 27)>
<26, (12, 23, 29)>
<27, (4, 9, 25)>
<28, (11, 16, 22)>
<29, (12, 24, 26)>

So, there are a total of [23] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
