Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 3, 0)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
