Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Looking at the given information, the 3-star graphs in the graph are the following:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (3, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
