Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Starting with Node 0:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- <0, (7, 6, 8)>
- <0, (7, 2, 5)>
- <0, (8, 2, 7)>

2. Moving on to Node 1:
- <1, (9, 3, 6)>
- <1, (9, 2, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 1, 2)>
- <1, (6, 7, 1)>
- <1, (6, 3, 8)>

3. Next, Node 2:
- <2, (9, 7, 1)>
- <2, (9, 7, 0)>
- <2, (7, 1, 9)>
- <2, (7, 0, 6)>
- <2, (1, 0, 5)>

4. Moving on to Node 3:
- <3, (9, 1, 6)>
- <3, (9, 8, 0)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (6, 0, 5)>
- <3, (6, 7, 1)>
- <3, (6, 1, 2)>

5. Next, Node 4:
- <4, (5, 9, 3)>
- <4, (5, 0, 7)>
- <4, (9, 3, 1)>
- <4, (9, 1, 6)>

6. Moving on to Node 5:
- <5, (9, 4, 0)>
- <5, (9, 0, 7)>
- <5, (4, 0, 3)>

7. Next, Node 6:
- <6, (7, 1, 3)>
- <6, (7, 2, 1)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 0)>

8. Moving on to Node 7:
- <7, (9, 0, 6)>
- <7, (9, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>

9. Next, Node 8:
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (6, 3, 0)>
- <8, (6, 1, 2)>

10. Finally, Node 9:
- <9, (5, 4, 0)>
- <9, (5, 0, 7)>
- <9, (4, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
