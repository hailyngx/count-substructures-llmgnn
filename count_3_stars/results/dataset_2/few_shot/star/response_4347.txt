Node 9 is connected to node 10, 1, 13, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 13, 4, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, 0, 3, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 12, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star graph:
Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 7 with 1 neighbor
- Node 2 with 3 neighbors
- Node 6 with 3 neighbors
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors
- Node 11 with 3 neighbors

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, construct the 3-stars:
- For Node 2: <2, (11, 14, 6)>
- For Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 10)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- For Node 11: <11, (1, 2, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars:
