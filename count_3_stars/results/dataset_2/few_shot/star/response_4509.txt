Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 3, 4, 8, 14, and 16 are not connected to exactly three other nodes, so we can eliminate them.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 13, 10, and 19
   - 3-star: <0, (13, 10, 19)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 2
   - 3-star: <1, (13, 11, 2)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 1, and 19
   - 3-star: <2, (6, 10, 1)>
   - 3-star: <2, (6, 10, 19)>
   - 3-star: <2, (6, 1, 19)>
   - 3-star: <2, (10, 1, 19)>

4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 14
   - 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 14)>

5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 18
   - 3-star: <6, (5, 2, 18)>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 5, and 18
   - 3-star: <9, (15, 5, 18)>

7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 0, and 19
   - 3-star: <10, (15, 0, 19)>

8. Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 8
   - 3-star: <12, (17, 18, 8)>

9. Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 7
   - 3-star: <13, (17, 1, 7)>

10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 9
    - 3-star: <15, (3, 10, 9)>

11. Node 17 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 12
    - 3-star: <17, (13, 11, 12)>

12. Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 12
    - 3-star: <18, (9, 6, 12)>

13. Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 0, and 2
    - 3-star: <19, (10, 0, 2)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (13, 10, 19)>, <1, (13, 11, 2)>, <2, (6, 10, 1)>, <2, (6, 10, 19)>, <2, (6, 1, 19)>, <2, (10, 1, 19)>, <5, (9, 6, 14)>, <6, (5, 2, 18)>, <9, (15, 5, 18)>, <10, (15, 0, 19)>, <12, (17, 18, 8)>, <13, (17, 1, 7)>, <15, (3, 10, 9)>, <17, (13, 11, 12)>, <18, (9, 6, 12)>, <19, (10, 0, 2)>.
