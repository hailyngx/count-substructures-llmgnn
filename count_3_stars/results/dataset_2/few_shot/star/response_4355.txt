Response:
When counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can visually identify them by finding nodes with exactly 3 neighbors and considering them along with their 3 neighbors. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 12: (5, 9, 1) 
- Node 10: (0, 7, 1) 
- Node 1: (14, 10, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
<12, (5, 9, 1)>, <10, (0, 7, 1)>, <1, (14, 10, 7)>
