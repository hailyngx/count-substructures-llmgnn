Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 0, and 19. <11, (16, 0, 19)>
2. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 0, and 7. <16, (11, 0, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, and 14. <4, (8, 19, 14)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 12, and 3. <7, (16, 12, 3)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 8. <12, (7, 6, 8)>
6. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 12, and 17. <13, (11, 12, 17)>
7. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 2. <14, (4, 6, 2)>
8. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 5, and 13. <17, (18, 5, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
