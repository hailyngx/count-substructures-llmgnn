Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 16
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 11
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 6
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 17, and 16

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:

   There are <5, (9, 0, 16)>, <7, (9, 3, 11)>, <8, (9, 16, 6)>, and <15, (18, 17, 16)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
