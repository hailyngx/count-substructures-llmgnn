Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

From the given information, we can see that nodes 1, 8, and 17 are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming possible central nodes for 3-stars. Let's examine the 3-stars that can be formed from these central nodes:

1. For central node 1:
   - <1, (2, 9, 17)>
  
2. For central node 8:
   - <8, (3, 9, 17)>
  
3. For central node 17:
   - <17, (1, 8, 11)>

There are no other central nodes with exactly three connections, so the total count of 3-stars is [3].
