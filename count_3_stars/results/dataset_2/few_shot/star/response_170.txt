Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 1, and 23. So, the 3-star is <15, (27, 1, 23)>.
2. Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 13. So, the 3-star is <27, (15, 17, 13)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 5, and 1. So, the 3-star is <2, (29, 5, 1)>.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 8, and 21. So, the 3-star is <9, (22, 8, 21)>.
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 22, 5, and 25. So, the 3-star is <10, (22, 5, 25)>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 0, and 24. So, the 3-star is <6, (17, 0, 24)>.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 14. So, the 3-star is <8, (7, 9, 14)>.
8. Node 13 is connected to nodes 27, 25, and 4. So, the 3-star is <13, (27, 25, 4)>.
9. Node 21 is connected to nodes 12, 9, and 17. So, the 3-star is <21, (12, 9, 17)>.
10. Node 23 is connected to nodes 15, 7, 28, and 4. So, the 3-star is <23, (15, 7, 28)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
