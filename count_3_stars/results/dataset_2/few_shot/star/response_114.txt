Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

1. From the given graph description, we can see that the nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 19.

2. For a 3-star, we need to find a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

3. Below is the list of all 3-stars found in the given graph:
    - <2, (10, 3, 16)>
    - <3, (7, 0, 2)>
    - <4, (1, 16, 14)>
    - <5, (11, 8, 13)>
    - <6, (10, 17, 6)>
    - <7, (8, 19, 3)>
    - <8, (19, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (19, 15, 9)>
    - <10, (11, 6, 12)>
    - <11, (10, 19, 5)>
    - <12, (10, 17, 19)>
    - <13, (5)>
    - <14, (4, 16, 12)>
    - <15, (7, 0, 9)>
    - <16, (4, 17, 2)>
    - <17, (6, 16, 12)>
    - <18, (15, 1, 18)>
    - <19, (11, 8, 7)>

4. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
