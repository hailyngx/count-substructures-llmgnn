Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, 13, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 10, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, 12, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 12, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 13, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 3, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, 1, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 8, 3, 1, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 14, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<10, (11, 0, 12)>
<0, (9, 13, 10)>
<13, (11, 8, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [7]
