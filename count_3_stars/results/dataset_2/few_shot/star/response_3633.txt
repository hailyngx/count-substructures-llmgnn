Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For a 3-star, we need a central node and 3 connected nodes.
- We can loop through all nodes and check if each node has exactly three neighbors, which form a 3-star with that node as the center.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, -)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [9].
