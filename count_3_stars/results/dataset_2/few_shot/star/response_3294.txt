Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This forms a 3-star with the central node and three leaves.

Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's start by listing them:

<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (8, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
