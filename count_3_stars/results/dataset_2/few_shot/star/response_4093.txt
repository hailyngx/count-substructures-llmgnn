Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3)

Node 18 is connected to node 13, 19, and node 6
Node 19 is connected to node 8, 11, 18, and node 15

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.  
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9

Step 2: For each of these nodes, determine if they form a 3-star pattern.
<1, (10, 5, 9)>
<6, (18, 19, 13)>
<9, (12, 1, 9)>
