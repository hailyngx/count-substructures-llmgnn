Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
As given, the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. We need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's look at the definition of a 3-star graph. A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Now, let's analyze the given graph to find the 3-star structures. We see that a 3-star structure will have the center as one of its nodes. 

Next, let's list the 3-star structures in the graph:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-star structures found, we get a total of 10.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
