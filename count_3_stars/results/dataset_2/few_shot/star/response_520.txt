Response:
The 3-star graph in the given graph is formed by the center node and its three connected nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars and count them.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (27, 16, 29)>
<1, (3, 13, 12)>
<2, (18, 22, 13)>
<3, (1, 20, 27)>
<4, (21, 9, 17)>
<5, (10, 6, 16)>
<6, (10)>
<7, (1, 29, 8)>
<8, (27, 21, 9)>
<9, (18, 25, 4)>
<10, (5, 6, 25)>
