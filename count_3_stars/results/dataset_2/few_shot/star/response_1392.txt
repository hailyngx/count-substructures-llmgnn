Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. **Identify Nodes with 3 Connections**:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 5 forming a potential 3-star.
    - Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 11 forming a potential 3-star.

2. **Check for 3-Stars**:
    - <4, (12, 13, 5)>
    - <13, (4, 2, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Final answer: [2]
