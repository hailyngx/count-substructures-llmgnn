Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to count the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<1, (7, 6, 13)>
<2, (4, 8, 14)>
<3, (11, 5, 8)>
<4, (13, 0, 14)>
<5, (3, 14, 4)>
<6, (10, 1, 0)>
<7, (12, 11, 14)>
<8, (11, 2, 9)>
<9, (11, 8, 14)>
<10, (11, 6, 12)>
<11, (7, 10, 3)>
<12, (7, 10, 8)>
<13, (4, 7, 1)>
<14, (4, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
