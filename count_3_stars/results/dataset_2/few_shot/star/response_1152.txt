Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which form a 3-star pattern.
Since a 3-star pattern consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with three edges. From the adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes that have three edges: nodes 0, 1, and 6.

Step 2: List out the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, _)>
<6, (5, 1, _)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[3]
