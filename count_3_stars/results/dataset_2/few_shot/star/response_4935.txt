Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Analyze the edges to find the connections between nodes:
   - From the given edges, we can see the connections between nodes.

2. Find the 3-stars in the graph:
   - A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will search for all such structures in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
