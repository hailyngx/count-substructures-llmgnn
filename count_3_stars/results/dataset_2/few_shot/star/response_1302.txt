Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 13, 22)>
<9, (5, 22, 29)>
<10, (17, 0, 23)>
<12, (27, 2, 25)>
<15, (9, 1, 25)>
<17, (10, 6, 18)>
<20, (4, 0, 6)>
<21, (8, 15, 25)>
<22, (5, 9, 6)>
<23, (11, 10, 0)>
<24, (29, 2, 24)>
<26, (13, 14, 26)>
<27, (12, 29, 7)>
<28, (5, 8, 28)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14]
