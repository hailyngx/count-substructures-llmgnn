Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 3.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 0.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3.
   - There is a 3-star centered around Node 1:
     <1, (5, 9, 3)>

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 8.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 2.

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 0.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 3.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 6.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 4.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 1.
   - There is a 3-star centered around Node 5:
     <5, (9, 8, 1)>

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 1.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 6.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 7.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
   - There is a 3-star centered around Node 8:
     <8, (5, 9, 7)>

10. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 4.
   - There is no 3-star centered around Node 9.

Now counting the total number of 3-stars found, it is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>
