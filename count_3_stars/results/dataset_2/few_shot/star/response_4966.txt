Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- For Node 1: <1, (4, 8, 6)>
- For Node 2: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- For Node 3: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- For Node 4: <4, (8, 5, 1)>
- For Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- For Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- For Node 8: <8, (4, 9, 0)> and <8, (4, 6, 1)>
- For Node 9: No 3-star can be formed since it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <4, (8, 5, 1)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 9, 0)>, and <8, (4, 6, 1)>.
