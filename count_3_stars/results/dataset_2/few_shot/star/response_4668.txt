Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition provided, for a 3-star, we need a central node connected with exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (17, 8, 16)>
<0, (17, 16, 18)>
<0, (8, 16, 18)>
<1, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (11, 4, 12)>
<1, (11, 7, 12)>
<2, (3, 15, 19)>
<2, (15, 9, 2)>
<2, (15, 16, 2)>
<3, (16, 8, 0)>
<3, (16, 7, 11)>
<4, (11, 7, 16)>
<4, (11, 7, 16)>
<5, (1, 12, 14)>
<6, (12, 17, 0)>
<9, (18, 0, 16)>
<9, (18, 0, 8)>
<10, (15, 9, 16)>
<10, (15, 9, 18)>
<13, (10, 15, 9)>
<13, (10, 15, 9)>
<15, (10, 13, 9)>
<15, (10, 13, 9)>
<16, (0, 7, 11)>
<16, (0, 7, 11)>
<17, (0, 12, 6)>
<18, (15, 19, 2)>
<18, (15, 19, 4)>
<19, (15, 9, 16)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [30].
