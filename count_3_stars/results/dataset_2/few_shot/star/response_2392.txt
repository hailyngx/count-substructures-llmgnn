Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Observation 1: A 3-star graph consists of a center node and three other nodes connected to the center node. 
Observation 2: To form a 3-star, we need to select one node as the center and then select three nodes that are connected to this center node.

Using the given information, we can list the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <1, (2, 9, 8)>
5. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
6. <2, (5, 4, 7)>
7. <3, (0, 6, 0)>
8. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
9. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
10. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
11. <5, (2, 7, 4)>
12. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
13. <7, (2, 4, 8)>
14. <7, (4, 5, 8)>
15. <8, (0, 1, 9)>
16. <8, (4, 5, 7)>
17. <9, (0, 1, 8)>
18. <9, (1, 8, 0)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
