Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 4

2. Identify the central node for each 3-star:
- Nodes with degree 3 cannot be central nodes of a 3-star.
- Nodes with degree 4 or 5 can be central nodes.

3. Identify the leaves for each central node and count the 3-stars:
- For each central node, count the number of unique combinations of connected nodes to form 3-stars.
- Count the total number of 3-stars.

4. [Count the total number of 3-stars] and list them inside brackets []: [<5, (9, 7, 0)>, <5, (7, 9, 0)>, <5, (7, 0, 1)>]
