Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique combinations of nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
