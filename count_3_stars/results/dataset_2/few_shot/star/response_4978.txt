Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 has 5 connections: 5, 9, 4, 14, and 11.
   - There is a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (5, 9, 4)>.
   
2. For node 1:
   - Node 1 has 3 connections: 9, 8, and 6.
   
3. For node 2:
   - Node 2 has 3 connections: 9, 8, and 10.

4. For node 3:
   - Node 3 has 5 connections: 4, 7, 13, 12, and 10.
   - There is a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (4, 7, 13)>.

5. For node 4:
   - Node 4 has 4 connections: 7, 12, 0, and 3.

6. For node 5:
   - Node 5 has 4 connections: 6, 0, 7, and 14.

7. For node 6:
   - Node 6 has 5 connections: 5, 7, 1, 11, and 12.
   - There is a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (5, 7, 1)>.

8. For node 7:
   - Node 7 has 6 connections: 5, 4, 3, 6, 14, and 13.

9. For node 8:
   - Node 8 has 4 connections: 13, 2, 10, and 1.

10. For node 9:
    - Node 9 has 4 connections: 2, 1, 0, and 12.

11. For node 10:
    - Node 10 has 3 connections: 8, 2, and 3.

12. For node 11:
    - Node 11 has 3 connections: 13, 6, and 0.

13. For node 12:
    - Node 12 has 4 connections: 9, 4, 6, and 3.

14. For node 13:
    - Node 13 has 4 connections: 7, 8, 11, and 3.

15. For node 14:
    - Node 14 has 3 connections: 5, 7, and 0.

The 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (4, 7, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 1)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
