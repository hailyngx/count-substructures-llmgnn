Response:
Let's go step by step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. In this case, nodes 1, 5, and 6 are central nodes.

Step 2: For each central node, find the leaves connected to it. To form a 3-star, a central node must be connected to exactly 3 leaves.

Let's start with the central node 1:
Central node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. Since it needs 3 leaves to form a 3-star, we cannot form a 3-star with node 1 as the central node.

Move on to the central node 5:
Central node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 4. A 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the central node:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>

Lastly, look at the central node 6:
Central node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. Since it needs 3 leaves to form a 3-star, we cannot form a 3-star with node 6 as the central node.

After analyzing all central nodes, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
