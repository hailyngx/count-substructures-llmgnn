Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find these 3-stars step by step:

1. Analyze each node in the graph to identify if it is the central node of a 3-star.
2. For each node that qualifies as the center of a 3-star, list the connected nodes as leaves.

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7. Hence, <0, (9, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7. Hence, <1, (9, 4, 7)> is another 3-star.

Checking Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1. Hence, <2, (5, 4, 1)> is a 3-star with Node 2 as the center.

Proceeding to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 8. Hence, <5, (6, 2, 8)> is a 3-star with Node 5 as the center.

Moving on to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3. Hence, <6, (5, 4, 3)> is a 3-star with Node 6 as the center.

Checking Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. Hence, <8, (5, 9, 1)> is a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 3)>.
