Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Observations:
- In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- The center node in a 3-star cannot be connected to each other with an edge because otherwise, it would form a cycle of length four.

Based on the given information, the potential 3-stars would have the center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's check each node to see if they are part of a 3-star:

1. For Node 0: (0, 5, 13, 6) - Not a 3-star.
2. For Node 1: (1, 5, 9, 11) - Not a 3-star.
3. For Node 2: (2, 5, 13, 1) - Not a 3-star.
4. For Node 3: (3, 5, 9, 7) - Not a 3-star.
5. For Node 4: (4, 7, 10, 11) - 3-star found: <4, (7, 10, 11)>
6. For Node 5: (5, 9, 3, 1) - Not a 3-star.
7. For Node 6: (6, 4, 8, 10) - 3-star found: <6, (4, 8, 10)>
8. For Node 7: (7, 9, 4, 3) - Not a 3-star.
9. For Node 8: (8, 13, 14, 11) - 3-star found: <8, (13, 14, 11)>
10. For Node 9: (9, 5, 3, 1) - Not a 3-star.
11. For Node 10: (10, 4, 6) - Not a 3-star.
12. For Node 11: (11, 4, 8, 3) - Not a 3-star.
13. For Node 12: (12, 8, 11, 3) - Not a 3-star.
14. For Node 13: (13, 8, 2, 0) - Not a 3-star.
15. For Node 14: (14, 8, 12) - Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<6, (4, 8, 10)>
<8, (13, 14, 11)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
