Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes meeting this criteria:
- Node 5: Connected to 9, 25, 28
- Node 9: Connected to 5, 29, 15
- Node 7: Connected to 21, 29, 14
- Node 12: Connected to 27, 13, 24
- Node 14: Connected to 7, 27, 26
- Node 18: Connected to 23, 19, 15
- Node 20: Connected to 5, 19, 1
- Node 25: Connected to 5, 10, 0

2. The 3-stars in the graph can be formed by considering the center node along with the nodes it is connected to. 

Counting the number of unique 3-stars:<4>

3-stars found:
<5, (9, 25, 28)>
<9, (5, 29, 15)>
<7, (21, 29, 14)>
<12, (27, 13, 24)>
