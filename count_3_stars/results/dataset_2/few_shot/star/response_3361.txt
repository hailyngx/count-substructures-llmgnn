Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by examining each node to see if it is a central node of a 3-star. A 3-star will have the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <2, (26, 10, 7)>
- <10, (2, 26, 3)>
- <13, (16, 4, 24)>
- <15, (17, 1, 6)>
- <17, (0, 19, 27)>
- <19, (17, 22, 18)>
- <20, (14, 21, 28)>
- <22, (14, 23, 19)>
- <23, (22, 5, 6)>
- <26, (2, 10, 4)>
- <29, (5, 11, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
