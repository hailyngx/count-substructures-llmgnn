Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 8) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 9) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 13) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of a 3-star.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (18, 13, 16)>
<6, (3, 14, 19)>
<8, (15, 12, 14)>
<12, (11, 7, 17)>
<16, (2, 7, 17)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [5].
