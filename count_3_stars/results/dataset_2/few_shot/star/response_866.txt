Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 13)>
<1, (0, 2, 12)>
<2, (1, 17, 0)>
<3, (1, 17, 19)>
<4, (0, 8, 11)>
<5, (2, 16, 14)>
<6, (15, 14, 7)>
<7, (8, 6, 15)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 16)>
<10, (15, 19, 16)>
<11, (4, 14, 18)>
<12, (1, 17, 2)>
<13, (0, 15, 14)>
<14, (5, 18, 6)>
<15, (10, 19, 6)>
<16, (5, 19, 9)>
<17, (12, 2, 3)>
<18, (14, 11, 4)>
<19, (10, 15, 3)>

There are a total of [20] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
