Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We will do this by checking each node and seeing if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes. 

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <0, (4, 9, 14)>.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <1, (3, 7, 13)>.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <2, (6, 10, 11)>.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <3, (1, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <4, (9, 13, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (10, 13, 4)>.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <6, (4, 9, 14)>, <6, (2, 10, 11)>.
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <7, (3, 5, 13)>, <7, (1, 5, 13)>.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <8, (3, 5, 10)>, <8, (11, 2, 10)>.
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <9, (4, 6, 11)>, <9, (0, 12, 4)>.
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <10, (8, 2, 5)>.
- Node 11 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <11, (1, 9, 12)>, <11, (8, 2, 12)>.
- Node 12 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <12, (13, 9, 14)>, <12, (11, 2, 14)>.
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <13, (4, 7, 12)>, <13, (1, 5, 12)>.
- Node 14 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <14, (6, 0, 12)>.

There are a total of 17 unique 3-stars present in the given graph as shown above. 
Hence, the final answer is [17].
