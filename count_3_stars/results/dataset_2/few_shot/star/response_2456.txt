Response:
Okay, let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the central nodes. From the adjacency list, the central nodes can be nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13. 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:

1. Node 0: 
   - <0, (14, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (14, 8, 2)>
   - <0, (14, 8, 1)>
   - <0, (5, 13, 3)>
   Total: 4

2. Node 1: 
   - <1, (7, 14, 8)>
   - <1, (7, 2, 8)>
   - <1, (7, 8, 6)>
   - <1, (14, 4, 9)>
   Total: 4

3. Node 2: 
   - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
   - <2, (7, 1, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 8, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 8, 1)>
   Total: 4

4. Node 4:
   - <4, (10, 9, 1)>
   - <4, (10, 9, 7)>
   - <4, (10, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (10, 1, 9)>
   Total: 4

5. Node 6:
   - <6, (7, 12, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 12, 9)>
   - <6, (7, 8, 12)>
   - <6, (3, 5, 13)>
   Total: 4

6. Node 7: 
   - <7, (11, 9, 12)>
   - <7, (11, 9, 4)>
   - <7, (11, 12, 9)>
   - <7, (11, 12, 6)>
   Total: 4

7. Node 9:
   - <9, (7, 8, 12)>
   - <9, (7, 8, 1)>
   - <9, (7, 1, 4)>
   - <9, (7, 1, 8)>
   Total: 4

8. Node 11:
   - <11, (10, 7, 12)>
   - <11, (10, 7, 1)>
   - <11, (10, 1, 7)>
   - <11, (10, 1, 2)>
   Total: 4

9. Node 12:
   - <12, (11, 7, 13)>
   - <12, (11, 7, 6)>
   - <12, (11, 13, 7)>
   - <12, (11, 13, 5)>
   Total: 4

10. Node 13:
   - <13, (12, 14, 4)>
   - <13, (12, 14, 1)>
   - <13, (12, 4, 14)>
   - <13, (12, 4, 5)>
   Total: 4

Adding all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
