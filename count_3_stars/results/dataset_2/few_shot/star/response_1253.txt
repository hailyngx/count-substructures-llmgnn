Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, the central node and its adjacent nodes are:
  - Node 0: (9, 1, 3, 4, 2, 8)
  - Node 1: (3, 4, 0)
  - Node 2: (5, 7, 0)
  - Node 3: (6, 1, 7, 0, 8)
  - Node 4: (5, 9, 1, 0)
  - Node 5: (9, 2, 4, 7)
  - Node 6: (9, 7, 3, 8)
  - Node 7: (5, 6, 3, 2)
  - Node 8: (6, 3, 0)
  - Node 9: (5, 6, 4, 0)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- We will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if a node has exactly three neighbors. The count is as follows:
  - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 7. <5, (9, 4, 7)>
  - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 3. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
  - Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 3. <7, (5, 6, 3)>
  - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 0. <9, (5, 4, 0)>
  - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 1. <4, (5, 9, 1)>
  - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 7. <3, (6, 1, 7)>
  - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 0. <1, (3, 4, 0)>
  
The number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
  
Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 4, 7)> <6, (9, 7, 3)> <7, (5, 6, 3)> <9, (5, 4, 0)> <4, (5, 9, 1)> <3, (6, 1, 7)> <1, (3, 4, 0)>
