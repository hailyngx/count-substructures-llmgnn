Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern consisting of a central node and three leaves.

From the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (6, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 4)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
