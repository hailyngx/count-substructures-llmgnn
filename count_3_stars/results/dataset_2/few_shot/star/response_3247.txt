Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars (central node, leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3) in this graph:

<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<0, (6, 5, 2)>
<1, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
<1, (9, 5, 2)>
<2, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (9, 0, 5)>
<2, (9, 7, 5)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
<7, (6, 0, 9)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<7, (6, 0, 1)>
<8, (6, 4, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 6, 4)>
<9, (8, 6, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars we found:
