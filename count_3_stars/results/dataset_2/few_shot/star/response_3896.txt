Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 13) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 10) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 16) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 16) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 0) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 15, 19, and node 6

Node 18 is connected to node 3, 9, 19, and node 11
Node 19 is connected to node 10, 18, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<1, (3, 12, 15)>
<3, (1, 12, 18)>
<4, (2, 7, 11)>
<6, (0, 7, 15)>
<8, (2, 6, 16)>
<10, (9, 15, 19)>
<11, (4, 13, 18)>
<16, (8, 12, 14)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>
<19, (0, 10, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
