Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star patterns can be identified by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-star patterns:

<0, (8, 7, 13)>
<1, (15, 2, 6)>
<2, (6, 15, 3)>
<4, (8, 10, 18)>
<5, (6, 18, 14)>
<7, (13, 0, 3)>
<9, (16, 6, 14)>
<12, (4, 17, 18)>
<13, (8, 15, 7)>
<15, (11, 13, 2)>
<16, (11, 9)>
<18, (4, 12, 19)>
<19, (18, 3)>

Now, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars. The total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
