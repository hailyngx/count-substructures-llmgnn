Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 7, 12, 5, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 13, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 13, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 12, 0, 14, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 5, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 3, 12, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (3, 11, 12)>
<2, (8, 7, 12)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<5, (6, 8, 13)>
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<7, (3, 12, 14)>
<8, (9, 2, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 12)>
<10, (6, 3, 12)>
<11, (6, 1, 11)>
<12, (9, 1, 7)>
<13, (4, 2, 5)>
<14, (4, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
