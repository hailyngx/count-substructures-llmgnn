Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 12, 10, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 12, 10, 11, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 11, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 13, 7, 11, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 10, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 14, 10, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 8, 13, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 0, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 9, and node 11

Response:
There are <5, (2, 8, 11)>, <9, (1, 8, 10)>, <2, (5, 8, 12)>, <0, (3, 10, 11)>, and <6, (5, 13, 11)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
