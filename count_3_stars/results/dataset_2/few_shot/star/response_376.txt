Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the possibilities for 3-stars are as follows:
- Node 0: (1, 3, 7), (4, 7, 8)
- Node 1: (0, 7, 12)
- Node 2: (3, 5, 13)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 14)
- Node 4: (0, 5, 13), (6, 9, 13)
- Node 5: (2, 7, 9), (4, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (4, 11, 13), (6, 11, 14)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 12)
- Node 8: (0, 4, 14), (9, 10, 14)
- Node 9: (4, 10, 12), (5, 8, 12)
- Node 10: (8, 9, 14), (2, 9, 14)
- Node 11: (6, 14, 0)
- Node 12: (1, 7, 9), (9, 11, 14)
- Node 13: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 14: (3, 8, 10), (0, 6, 11), (12, 6, 14)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 12)>, <2, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (0, 2, 14)>, <4, (0, 5, 13)>, <4, (6, 9, 13)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 11, 13)>, <6, (6, 11, 14)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 12)>, <8, (0, 4, 14)>, <8, (9, 10, 14)>, <9, (4, 10, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 12)>, <10, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (2, 9, 14)>, <11, (6, 14, 0)>, <12, (1, 7, 9)>, <12, (9, 11, 14)>, <13, (2, 4, 6)>, <14, (3, 8, 10)>, <14, (0, 6, 11)>, <14, (12, 6, 14)>.

Count of 3-stars: [26]
