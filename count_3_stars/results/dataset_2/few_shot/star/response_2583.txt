Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 6
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 10: degree = 4
- Node 11: degree = 4
- Node 12: degree = 6
- Node 13: degree = 5
- Node 14: degree = 4

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 12)>
<1, (3, 10, 11)>
<2, (0, 8, 13)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<4, (8, 12, 14)>
<5, (10, 11)>
<6, (1, 11, 13)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 12)>
<10, (1, 5, 14)>
<11, (1, 5, 6)>
<12, (0, 4, 13)>
<13, (2, 6, 14)>
<14, (3, 4, 10)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [14]
