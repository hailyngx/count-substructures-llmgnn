Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Possible 3-stars centered at node 0:
<0, (8, 4, 5)>
<0, (8, 3, 5)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 1:
<1, (4, 9, 3)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 2:
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 3:
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 0, 1)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 4: 
<4, (1, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<4, (1, 0, 9)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 5:
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 2)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 6:
<6, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 7:
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 8:
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>

Possible 3-stars centered at node 9:
<9, (8, 1, 3)>
<9, (8, 3, 0)>
<9, (8, 0, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [24]

Therefore, there are 24 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
