Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (26, 27, 1)>
<7, (26, 0, 25)>
<10, (7, 5, 13)>
<25, (21, 7, 1)>
<11, (2, 24, 8)>
<5, (7, 23, 17)>
<13, (21, 9, 10)>
<1, (18, 22, 4)>
<8, (22, 0, 11)>
<14, (4, 8, 15)>
<12, (9, 17, 5)>
<15, (25, 14, 25)>
<18, (19, 20, 1)>
<20, (2, 18, 23)>
<21, (24, 13, 25)>
<22, (6, 29, 1)>
<23, (5, 29, 20)>
<29, (19, 22, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
