Response:
We need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's first identify the central nodes and their neighbors based on the adjacency list provided:
- Central Node 0: Connected to [7]
- Central Node 1: Connected to [17, 14, 8, 7]
- Central Node 2: Connected to [11, 14, 4]
- Central Node 3: Connected to [17, 14, 4, 18]
- Central Node 4: Connected to [16, 2 3]
- Central Node 5: Connected to [15]
- Central Node 6: Connected to [11, 19]
- Central Node 7: Connected to [0, 1, 13, 8]
- Central Node 8: Connected to [1, 7, 12, 18]
- Central Node 9: Connected to [16, 14, 10]
- Central Node 10: Connected to [9, 15, 18]
- Central Node 11: Connected to [6, 2]
- Central Node 12: Connected to [16, 8, 19]
- Central Node 13: Connected to [7, 18]
- Central Node 14: Connected to [9, 2, 1, 15, 3]
- Central Node 15: Connected to [5, 10, 14]
- Central Node 16: Connected to [12, 4, 9, 19]
- Central Node 17: Connected to [1, 3]
- Central Node 18: Connected to [10, 3, 13, 8]
- Central Node 19: Connected to [16, 12, 6]

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars: 
<5, (15, 10, 14)>
<6, (11, 19, 16)>
<6, (11, 2, 4)>
<12, (19, 16, 4)>
<15, (5, 10, 14)>
<16, (12, 8, 19)>
<17, (1, 14, 3)>
<18, (10, 3, 13)>
<18, (10, 15, 14)>
<18, (10, 9, 16)>
<18, (8, 12, 16)>
<18, (8, 1, 14)>
<1, (7, 13, 18)>
<1, (7, 0, 8)>
<1, (17, 3, 4)>
<4, (16, 9, 14)>
<4, (16, 12, 19)>
<4, (16, 2, 3)>
<3, (17, 1, 14)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we find a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
