Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars where one node is at the center and the other three nodes are connected to this center.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (4, 13, 3)>
<1, (18, 12, 7)>
<2, (14, 6, 7)>
<3, (9, 19, 0)>
<4, (0, 16, 6)>
<5, (9, 19, 16)>
<6, (2, 16, 12)>
<7, (14, 2, 18)>
<8, (15)>
<9, (5, 18, 3)>
<11, (18, 15, 0)>
<12, (15, 0, 1)>
<13, (14, 19, 0)>
<14, (7, 2, 13)>
<15, (8, 19, 11)>
<16, (5, 4, 6)>
<17, (18)>
<18, (9, 17, 7)>
<19, (5, 15, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get [19].
