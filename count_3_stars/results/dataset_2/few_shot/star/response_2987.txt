This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2)

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to determine the 3-stars. 

1. From the adjacency list, we see that Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center, and nodes 9, 6, and 2 as the leaves. <5, (9, 6, 2)>

2. Similarly, Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8, forming a 3-star with Node 1 as the center, and nodes 9, 3, and 8 as the leaves. <1, (9, 3, 8)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8, forming another 3-star with Node 4 as the center, and nodes 5, 9, and 8 as the leaves. <4, (5, 9, 8)>

4. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 2, making a 3-star with Node 0 as the center, and nodes 9, 4, and 2 as the leaves. <0, (9, 4, 2)>

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8, creating a 3-star with Node 7 as the center, and nodes 1, 3, and 8 as the leaves. <7, (1, 3, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
