Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. Let's go through the steps to identify and count them.

Step 1: Look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
Node 5, Node 12, and Node 9 each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: Check if the neighbors of these nodes form 3-star configurations.
- For Node 5: (5, 13, 12), (5, 0, 7) form 3-stars.
- For Node 12: (12, 5, 14) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 9: No 3-star as its neighbors do not form a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
There are 3 distinct 3-stars in the given graph.

<5, (13, 12)>
<5, (0, 7)>
<12, (5, 14)>
