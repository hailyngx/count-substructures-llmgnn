Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 8, 5, and 3. Since node 0 has connections to nodes 7, 9, and 8, we have a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (7, 9, 8)>

2. For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9. Since node 1 has connections to nodes 4, 7, and 9, we have a 3-star centered at node 1. <1, (4, 7, 9)>

3. For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 0. Since node 3 has connections to nodes 8, 5, and 0, we have a 3-star centered at node 3. <3, (8, 5, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
