Response:
The 3-star graphs can be found in the following steps:
1. Identify all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 11: (6, 19, 0)
- Node 13: (26, 20, 15)
- Node 17: (9, 22, 0)

3-stars:
<11, (6, 19, 0)>
<13, (26, 20, 15)>
<17, (9, 22, 0)>
