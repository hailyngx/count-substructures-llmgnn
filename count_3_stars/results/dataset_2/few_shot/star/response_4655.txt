Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <4, (0, 7, 19)>
2. <7, (0, 4, 13)>
3. <14, (1, 16, 19)>
4. <17, (2, 5, 8)>
5. <0, (4, 2, 7)>
6. <1, (8, 14, 19)>
7. <2, (0, 7, 17)>
8. <5, (3, 4, 17)>
9. <9, (3, 11, 12)>
10. <12, (6, 9, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
