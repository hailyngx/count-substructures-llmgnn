Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 6, 7, 12, and 13
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 3, and 14
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 10
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 11

2. For each of these nodes, find all possible 3-stars:
- For Node 0:
  - <0, (6, 7, 12)>
  - <0, (6, 7, 13)>
  - <0, (6, 12, 13)>
- For Node 4:
  - <4, (5, 3, 14)>
- For Node 12:
  - <12, (0, 2, 10)>
- For Node 13:
  - <13, (0, 2, 11)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- Total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
