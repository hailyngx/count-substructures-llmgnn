Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. From node 1: <1, (9, 8, 12)>
2. From node 2: <2, (3, 1, 7)>
3. From node 3: <3, (1, 13, 6)>
4. From node 4: <4, (8, 9, 5)>
5. From node 7: <7, (12, 11, 10)>
6. From node 8: <8, (1, 9, 13)>
7. From node 9: <9, (1, 8, 10)>
8. From node 12: <12, (1, 14, 0)>
9. From node 13: <13, (7, 3, 8)>
10. From node 14: <14, (12, 11, 10)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars found. There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
