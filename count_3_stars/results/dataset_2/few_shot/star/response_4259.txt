Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

- Node 0 is a central node with leaves 9, 1, and 2. <0, (9, 1, 2)>
- Node 1 is a central node with leaves 5, 4, and 3. <1, (5, 4, 3)>
- Node 2 is a central node with leaves 9, 4, and 7. <2, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 is a central node with leaves 9, 4, and 1. <3, (9, 4, 1)>
- Node 4 is a central node with leaves 8, 2, and 1. <4, (8, 2, 1)>
- Node 5 is a central node with leaves 8, 1, and 0. <5, (8, 1, 0)>
- Node 6 is a central node with leaves 9, 1, and 3. <6, (9, 1, 3)>
- Node 7 is a central node with leaves 8, 2, and 0. <7, (8, 2, 0)>
- Node 8 is a central node with leaves 5, 4, and 7. <8, (5, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 is a central node with leaves 6, 2, and 3. <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
