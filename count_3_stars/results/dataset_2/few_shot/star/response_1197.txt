Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 1 has 3 connections: (1, 21), (1, 11), (1, 5)
- Node 3 has 4 connections: (3, 25), (3, 10), (3, 13), (3, 19)
- Node 4 has 3 connections: (4, 15), (4, 14), (4, 9)
- Node 5 has 5 connections: (5, 1), (5, 15), (5, 0), (5, 29), (5, 24)
- Node 8 has 3 connections: (8, 21), (8, 16), (8, 22)
- Node 10 has 5 connections: (10, 21), (10, 27), (10, 3), (10, 20), (10, 6)
- Node 13 has 4 connections: (13, 3), (13, 26), (13, 17), (13, 24)
- Node 16 has 3 connections: (16, 8), (16, 2), (16, 26)
- Node 17 has 4 connections: (17, 21), (17, 27), (17, 13), (17, 20)
- Node 19 has 4 connections: (19, 3), (19, 18), (19, 26), (19, 28)
- Node 20 has 4 connections: (20, 2), (20, 18), (20, 17), (20, 10)
- Node 21 has 4 connections: (21, 1), (21, 10), (21, 8), (21, 17)
- Node 26 has 5 connections: (26, 13), (26, 19), (26, 23), (26, 16), (26, 12)

From the provided edges, it is clear that nodes 1, 21, 5; 3, 25, 19; 4, 15, 14; 5, 1, 24; and 10, 3, 20 form 3-stars.

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (21, 5, 11)>, 
<3, (25, 19, 10)>,
<4, (15, 14, 9)>,
<5, (1, 24, 15)>,
<10, (3, 20, 6)>.

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
