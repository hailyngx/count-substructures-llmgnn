Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (13, 15, 23)>
<11, (1, 16, 2)>
<15, (0, 13, 20)>
<16, (4, 10, 19)>
<19, (4, 5, 23)>
<2, (3, 10, 27)>
<8, (7, 10, 23)>
<20, (2, 22, 28)>
<24, (6, 25, 29)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
