Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node for each potential 3-star. Then, we check if this central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the nodes in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 2. It forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. It does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, and 0. It does not form a 3-star since it's connected to four other nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 1, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 1. <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 4, 0, and 7. It forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 4. <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, and 0. It does not form a 3-star since it's connected to four other nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 3, and 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4. <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, and 0. It does not form a 3-star since it's connected to four other nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, 3, and 7. It forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 3. <9, (5, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
