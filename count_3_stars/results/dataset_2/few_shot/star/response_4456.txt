Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<8, (6, 12, 16)>
<12, (17, 7, 8)>
<16, (0, 8, 18)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
