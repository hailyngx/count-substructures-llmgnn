Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the center node and its connected nodes form 3-star patterns. Let's identify all the 3-stars:

- Starting from node 0: <0, (6, 4, 5)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>
- From node 1: <1, (6, 5, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (8, 3, 0)>
- From node 3: <3, (8, 2, 0)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 8, 0)>
- From node 5: <5, (2, 1, 0)>
- From node 6: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- From node 7: <7, (6, 9, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- From node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 
<0, (6, 4, 5)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <1, (6, 5, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (8, 3, 0)>, <3, (8, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>
