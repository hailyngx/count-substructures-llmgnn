Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star: a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections that form 3-stars are as follows:
- Node 5: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 6: (0, 10, 13)
- Node 7: (1, 9, 12)
- Node 8: (2, 10, 11)
- Node 9: (1, 7, 13)
- Node 11: (1, 8, 10)
- Node 12: (0, 7, 14)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 10, 13)>, <7, (1, 9, 12)>, <8, (2, 10, 11)>, <9, (1, 7, 13)>, <11, (1, 8, 10)>, <12, (0, 7, 14)>.

Since each unique 3-star contributes 1 to the total count, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
