Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the 3-stars. 
From the provided adjacency list, we can see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, -)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 7, -)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
