Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5: (5, 9, 17)
- Node 9: (9, 5, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 5, 11)
- Node 12: (12, 13, 18)
- Node 2: (2, 8, 16)
- Node 8: (8, 9, 7)
- Node 0: (0, 14, 16)
- Node 14: (14, 2, 6)
- Node 7: (7, 16, 10)
- Node 13: (13, 12, 17)
- Node 1: (1, 12, 18)
- Node 16: (16, 7, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 12, 14)
- Node 11: (11, 8, 3)
- Node 17: (17, 5, 13)
- Node 10: (10, 7, 1)
- Node 4: (4, 13, 19)
- Node 15: (15, 14)
- Node 18: (18, 12, 3)
- Node 19: (19, 2, 13)

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
