Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<10, (6, 15, 16)>
<4, (6, 9, 17)>
<1, (9, 7, 16)>
<2, (5, 13, 12)>
<7, (3, 1, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 14)>
<12, (9, 19, 2)>
<13, (6, 16, 2)>
<14, (6, 8, 16)>
<15, (10, 11, 19)>
<16, (10, 13, 14)>
<18, (17, 0, 15)>
<19, (15, 12, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
