Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <4, (7, 8, 5)> 
2. <7, (4, 0, 3)> 
3. <1, (4, 3, 9)> 
4. <2, (4, 8, 9)> 
5. <3, (7, 1, 0)> 
6. <8, (4, 3, 6)> 
7. <5, (4, 7, 3)> 
8. <6, (8, 5, 2)> 
9. <0, (7, 3, 5)> 
10. <9, (1, 3, 8)> 

There are total 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [10].
