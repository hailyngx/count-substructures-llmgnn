Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. For each node in the graph, identify all possible 3-stars where that node could be the center:
   
   - Node 0: There are no 3-stars involving node 0 as the center.
   
   - Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>
   
   - Node 2: There are no 3-stars involving node 2 as the center.
   
   - Node 3: <3, (5, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>
   
   - Node 4: There are no 3-stars involving node 4 as the center.
   
   - Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>
   
   - Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>
   
   - Node 7: There are no 3-stars involving node 7 as the center.
   
   - Node 8: <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 7)>
   
   - Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>

2. List all unique 3-stars:
   
   - <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>
   
   - <3, (5, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>
   
   - <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>
   
   - <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>
   
   - <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 7)>
   
   - <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]
