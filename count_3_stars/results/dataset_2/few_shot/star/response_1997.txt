Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by first identifying the central node (center) in each 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

Upon inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we find the following nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 7, 13, and 6.
- Node 7: Connected to node 1, forming a 3-star <7, (1, 13, 6)>.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 13 and 3.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 4, 6, and 3.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 12, and 1.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<7, (1, 13, 6)>, 
<9, (13, 3, x)>, 
<x, (4, 6, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
