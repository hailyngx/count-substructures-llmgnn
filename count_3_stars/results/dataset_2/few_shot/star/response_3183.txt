Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star graphs in the graph:
- Node 6: (6, 9, 26, 4)
- Node 15: (15, 11, 27, 25)
- Node 18: (18, 2, 14, 10)
- Node 27: (27, 15, 28, 19)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 19, 22)
- Node 20: (20, 9, 13, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 26, 7, 0)
- Node 14: (14, 18, 28, 22)
- Node 11: (11, 15, 28, 1)
- Node 16: (16, 18, 23, 4)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star graphs:
[10]

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 26, 4)>
<15, (11, 27, 25)>
<18, (2, 14, 10)>
<27, (15, 28, 19)>
<5, (0, 19, 22)>
<20, (9, 13, 8)>
<3, (26, 7, 0)>
<14, (18, 28, 22)>
<11, (15, 28, 1)>
<16, (18, 23, 4)>
