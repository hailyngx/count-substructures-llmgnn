Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is the center of a 3-star and correctly match the three leaves connected to it. 

Based on the adjacency list given for each node, we can start by identifying the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 7, 11)>
<1, (8, 12, 13)>
<2, (10, 14, 11)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 10)>
<5, (13, 8, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (12, 0, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 14, 3)>
<10, (4, 7, 2)>
<11, (12, 0, 2)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (5, 7, 12)>
<14, (9, 12, 2)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
