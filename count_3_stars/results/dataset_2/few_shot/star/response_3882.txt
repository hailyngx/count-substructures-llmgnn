Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are already part of a 3-star are: 

<0, (8, 14, 19)>
<3, (10, 0, 7)>
<4, (8, 2, 16)>
<7, (19, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 15, 0)>
<9, (18, 7, 12)>
<10, (11, 3, 16)>
<11, (10, 12)>
<12, (11, 17, 13, 9)>
<13, (0, 1, 12, 18)>
<14, (0, 2)>
<16, (10, 4, 17)>
<17, (1, 6, 16, 12, 5)>
<18, (13, 9)>
<19, (0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14.
