Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14)

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list out all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (9, 15, 19)>
<1, (11, 14, 19)>
<2, (16, 10, 4)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (2, 16, 7)>
<5, (8, 18, 6)>
<6, (18, 13, 15)>
<7, (3, 16, 19)>
<8, (3, 5, 11)>
<9, (3, 18, 13)>
<10, (2, 13, 19)>
<11, (1, 8, 12)>
<12, (13, 11, 6)>
<13, (17, 12, 10)>
<14, (1, 19, 14)>
<15, (11, 0, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [15].
