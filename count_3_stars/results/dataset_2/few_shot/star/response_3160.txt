Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Find the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check if these nodes form a 3-star pattern with one node as the center and the other three as leaves.

Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 19.

Let's analyze each of these nodes to determine if they form a 3-star:
1. Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 17) - Forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 17 as the leaves. <4, (0, 2, 17)>
2. Node 5: (5, 16, 17, 18) - Does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 6: (6, 11, 7, 17) - Forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 11, 7, and 17 as the leaves. <6, (11, 7, 17)>
4. Node 8: (8, 13, 19) - Forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 13, 19 as the leaves. <8, (13, 19)>
5. Node 9: (9, 0, 1, 14) - Forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 14 as the leaves. <9, (0, 1, 14)>
6. Node 12: (12, 7) - Does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 19: (19, 8, 16) - Does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <4, (0, 2, 17)>, <6, (11, 7, 17)>, and <8, (13, 19)>, <9, (0, 1, 14)>.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
