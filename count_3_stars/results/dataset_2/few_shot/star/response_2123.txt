Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 11, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 13, 12, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 11, 3, 13, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 11, 0, 13, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, 14, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 13, 14, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 5, 12, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 5, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the nodes that match this criteria:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7
4. Node 5: Connected to nodes 10, 12, and 13
5. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (10, 12, 13)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
