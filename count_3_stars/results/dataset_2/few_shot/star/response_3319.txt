Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 12, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 14, 10, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 12, 9, 10, 7, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 14, 13, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 0, 13, 11, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, 10, 11, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 2, 0, 12, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 2, 14, 7, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, 14, 5, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 11, 12, and node 5

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (14, 4, 10)>
<2, (8, 11, 7)>
<3, (6, 5, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 13)>
<5, (14, 12, 13)>
<6, (3, 0, 13)>
<7, (2, 10, 11)>
<8, (2, 7, 11)>
<9, (2, 0, 10)>
<10, (1, 2, 12)>
<11, (2, 14, 7)>
<12, (3, 2, 14)>
<13, (5, 4, 6)>
<14, (1, 11, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14].
