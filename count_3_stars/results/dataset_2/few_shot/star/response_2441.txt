Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges (1 central node and 3 leaf nodes).

Based on the adjacency list provided, the <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> for each 3-star configuration are as follows:
- <1, (5, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
