Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for every node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the unique 3-stars:

<3, (15, 21, 26)>  
<15, (3, 22, 24)>  
<2, (29, 1, 28)>  
<29, (2, 14, 24)>  
<10, (17, 21, 8)>  
<17, (10, 9, 4)>  
<4, (17, 8, x)>  
<8, (10, 4, x)>  
<13, (16, 11, 6)>  
<26, (3, 8, 18)>  
<1, (2, 7, x)>  
<21, (3, 10, 16)>  
<5, (24, 20, x)>  
<19, (22, 25, x)>  
<9, (17, 14, 27)>  
<12, (25, 6, x)>  
<16, (13, 21, 0)>  
<6, (13, 12, 27)>  
<14, (29, 9, 18)>  
<18, (3, 26, 14)>  
<25, (19, 12, 28)>  
<0, (15, 16, 23)>  
<11, (13, x, x)>  
<7, (1, x, x)>  
<27, (9, 22, 6)>  
<28, (2, 25, 20)>  
<20, (5, 22, 28)>  

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
