Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 8: <0, (5, 9, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 3: <1, (5, 4, 3)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 8: <2, (9, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <3, (1, 7, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 4: <6, (9, 7, 4)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 0: <7, (5, 6, 0)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 0: <8, (9, 3, 0)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 2: <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
