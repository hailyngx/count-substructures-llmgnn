Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find all 3-stars in the given graph. 

To find a 3-star, we need to look for a node that has exactly three neighbors and then identify the three edges that connect the neighbors to this central node. 

Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 0)>
<3, (9, 5, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
