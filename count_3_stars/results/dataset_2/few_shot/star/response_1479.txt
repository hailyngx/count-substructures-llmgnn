Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identifying Central Nodes:
   - Node 3, Node 14, and Node 12 have degree 4, which means they can act as central nodes.

2. Counting 3-Stars:
   - For Node 3:
     - <3, (15, 14, 10)>
     - <3, (15, 14, 5)>
       (2 3-stars for Node 3)

   - For Node 14:
     - <14, (3, 10, 19)>
     - <14, (3, 17, 1)>
     - <14, (3, 17, 19)>
       (3 3-stars for Node 14)

   - For Node 12:
     - <12, (4, 2, 18)>
     - <12, (4, 2, 19)>
       (2 3-stars for Node 12)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (15, 14, 10)>, <3, (15, 14, 5)>, 
<14, (3, 10, 19)>, <14, (3, 17, 1)>, <14, (3, 17, 19)>, 
<12, (4, 2, 18)>, <12, (4, 2, 19)>.
