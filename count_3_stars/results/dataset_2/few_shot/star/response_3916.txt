Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 1: Possible 3-star: <1, (9, 12, 8)>
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 3: Possible 3-star: <3, (4, 12, 10)>
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 5: Possible 3-star: <5, (9, 12, 10)>
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 9: Possible 3-star: <9, (5, 14, 1)>
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 11: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 12: Possible 3-star: <12, (5, 10, 3)>
- Node 13: Possible 3-star: <13, (4, 14, 1)>
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 5 nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (9, 12, 8)>
<3, (4, 12, 10)>
<5, (9, 12, 10)>
<9, (5, 14, 1)>
<12, (5, 10, 3)>
<13, (4, 14, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
