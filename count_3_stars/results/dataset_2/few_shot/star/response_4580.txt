Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. To do this, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star. 
Based on the adjacency list provided, the following nodes have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 12
- Node 18
- Node 19

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Starting with Node 2: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6
- There is no 3-star centered at Node 2.

Moving to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 19, and 8
- <5, (18, 19, 8)>

Looking at Node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 16, 3, and 9
- There is no 3-star centered at Node 12.

Checking Node 18:
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 0
- <18, (5, 6, 0)>

Finally, analyzing Node 19:
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 1
- <19, (5, 1, 1)>

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<[5, (18, 19, 8)>, <18, (5, 6, 0)>, <19, (5, 1, 1)>]
Count: [3].
