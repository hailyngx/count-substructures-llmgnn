Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go through each node and see if it is the center node of any 3-star:

1. Node 1: <1, (17, 18, 2)>
2. Node 3: No 3-stars
3. Node 4: <4, (8, 12, 11)>
4. Node 5: <5, (17, 18, 0)>
5. Node 6: <6, (10, 16, 7)>
6. Node 7: No 3-stars
7. Node 8: <8, (17, 4, 11)>
8. Node 9: No 3-stars
9. Node 10: <10, (17, 6, 2)>
10. Node 11: <11, (4, 8, 1)>
11. Node 12: <12, (4, 8, 15)>
12. Node 13: <13, (1, 15, 3)>
13. Node 14: <14, (19, 15, 0)>
14. Node 15: <15, (14, 13, 12)>
15. Node 16: <16, (18, 6, 7)>
16. Node 17: <17, (1, 8, 5)>
17. Node 18: <18, (5, 16, 1)>
18. Node 19: <19, (14, 11, 13)>
19. Node 0: No 3-stars

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<1, (17, 18, 2)>, 
<4, (8, 12, 11)>, 
<5, (17, 18, 0)>, 
<6, (10, 16, 7)>, 
<8, (17, 4, 11)>, 
<10, (17, 6, 2)>, 
<11, (4, 8, 1)>, 
<12, (4, 8, 15)>, 
<13, (1, 15, 3)>, 
<14, (19, 15, 0)>, 
<15, (14, 13, 12)>, 
<16, (18, 6, 7)>, 
<17, (1, 8, 5)>, 
<18, (5, 16, 1)>, 
<19, (14, 11, 13)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
