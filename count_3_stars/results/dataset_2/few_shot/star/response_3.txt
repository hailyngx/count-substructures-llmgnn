Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
I will identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (5, 4, 11)>
<1, (3, 7, 12)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 7)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (2, 12, 11)>
<6, (11, 14)>
<9, (4, 14, 10)>
<11, (5, 3, 10)>
<12, (5, 9, 1)>
<13, (10, 4, 14)>
<14, (9, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
