Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding a node which has exactly 3 neighbors and treating that node as the central node, and then counting the number of unique combinations of its neighbors. 

Let's first identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbours:
- Node 4 has only 1 neighbour.
- Node 11 has only 1 neighbour.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbours.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbours.

Now, let's look at the remaining nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbours.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbours.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbours.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbours.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbours.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbours.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbours.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbours.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbours.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbours.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbours.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbours.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbours.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbours.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbours.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbours.

So, we can consider nodes 0, 9, and 12 as central nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors each. Now, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each central node:

For Node 0:
- <0, 15, 16>: 1 combination

For Node 9:
- <9, 3, 17>: 1 combination
- <9, 12, 17>: 1 combination

For Node 12:
- <12, 2, 18>: 1 combination
- <12, 9, 17>: 1 combination
- <12, 19, 18>: 1 combination

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 15, 16>,
<9, 3, 17>,
<9, 12, 17>,
<12, 2, 18>,
<12, 9, 17>,
<12, 19, 18>.
