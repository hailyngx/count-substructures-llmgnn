Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.
Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (5, 9, 4)>
2. <1, (4, 3, 2)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 7)>
4. <3, (9, 1, 6)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 6)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 0)>
7. <6, (4, 7, 3)>
8. <7, (6, 2)>
9. <8, (9, 3, 6)>
10. <9, (8, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
