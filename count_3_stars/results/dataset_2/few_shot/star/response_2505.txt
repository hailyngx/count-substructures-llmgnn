Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the potential central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 19. We will evaluate each of these nodes to find the 3-stars.

1. For Node 0:
    - <0, (18, 11, 19)>
2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (4, 3, 10)>
    - <1, (4, 10, 19)>
3. For Node 3:
    - <3, (1, 14, 18)>
4. For Node 4:
    - <4, (7, 9, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 1, 6)>
    - <4, (7, 6, 15)>
5. For Node 10:
    - <10, (1, 17, 2)>
    - <10, (1, 17, 5)>
6. For Node 11:
    - <11, (7, 17, 0)>
7. For Node 12:
    - <12, (18, 13, 19)>
8. For Node 13:
    - <13, (2, 6, 12)>
9. For Node 14:
    - <14, (3, 19, 16)>
10. For Node 17:
    - <17, (10, 19, 11)>
11. For Node 19:
    - <19, (1, 17, 0)>
    - <19, (1, 17, 12)>
    - <19, (1, 0, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
