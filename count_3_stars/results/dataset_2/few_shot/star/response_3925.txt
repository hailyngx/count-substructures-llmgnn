Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the nodes connected to each node to form 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (17, 29, 15) -> <0, (17, 29, 15)>
2. Node 1: (28) -> <1, (28, 14, x)>
3. Node 2: (11, 19) -> <2, (11, 19, x)>
4. Node 3: (19, 6) -> <3, (19, 6, x)>
5. Node 4: (10, 13) -> <4, (10, 13, 16)>
6. Node 5: (18, 29, 27) -> <5, (18, 29, 27)>
7. Node 6: (29, 23) -> <6, (29, 23, x)>
8. Node 7: (10, 2) -> <7, (10, 2, x)>
9. Node 8: (20) -> <8, (20, x, x)>
10. Node 9: (0) -> <9, (0, x, 12)>
11. Node 10: (11, 7) -> <10, (11, 7, x)>
12. Node 11: (14, 12) -> <11, (14, 12, 15)>
13. Node 12: (9) -> <12, (9, x, 3)>
14. Node 13: (4) -> <13, (4, x, x)>
15. Node 14: (8, 22, 1) -> <14, (8, 22, 1)>
16. Node 15: (26, 16) -> <15, (26, 16, x)>
17. Node 16: (20) -> <16, (20, x, x)>
18. Node 17: (18) -> <17, (18, x, x)>
19. Node 18: (5) -> <18, (5, x, x)>
20. Node 19: (2, 3) -> <19, (2, 3, x)>
21. Node 20: (25) -> <20, (25, x, x)>
22. Node 21: (24) -> <21, (24, x, x)>
23. Node 22: (25, 26) -> <22, (25, 26, x)>
24. Node 23: (21, 26) -> <23, (21, 26, x)>
25. Node 24: (21) -> <24, (21, x, x)>
26. Node 25: (28) -> <25, (28, x, x)>
27. Node 26: (23) -> <26, (23, x, x)>
28. Node 27: (24) -> <27, (24, x, x)>
29. Node 28: (25) -> <28, (25, x, x)>
30. Node 29: (6, 0) -> <29, (6, 0, x)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
[24]
