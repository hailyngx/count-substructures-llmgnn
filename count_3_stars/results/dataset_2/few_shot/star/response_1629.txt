Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify groups of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two, creating a 3-star structure with one central node and two leaf nodes.

1. From the given graph information, we can see that there are multiple instances of 3-star structures. Let's identify them:

   - <12, (9, 7, 10)>
   - <2, (8, 1, 16)>
   - <0, (10, 6, 16)>
   - <6, (7, 0, 10)>
   - <15, (13, 2, 19)>
   - <10, (12, 0, 15)>
   - <16, (2, 0, 18)>
   - <13, (9, 5, 17)>

2. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars:
   
   - Total number of unique 3-stars: 8
   
3. Output the final answer within brackets:

   - [8]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
