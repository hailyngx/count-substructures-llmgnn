Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star pattern where one node is the center and the other three are connected to the center.

Let's look at the adjacency list of each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0, 3, and 4:
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (9, 4, 3)>
    - Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (9, 7, 1)>
    - Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
    
2. For Node 1 and 2:
    - Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 7, 6)>
    
3. For Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 1)>
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 2)>
    - Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 1, 8)>
    - Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (9, 4, 7)>
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 8)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
