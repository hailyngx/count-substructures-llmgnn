Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 11, 27, and 7 form a 3-star with each of them connected to the center and the other two nodes. <11, (7, 9, 4)> 
2. Similarly, nodes 18, 4, and 25 form a 3-star. <4, (11, 18, 25)>
3. Nodes 6, 9, and 27 form another 3-star. <9, (11, 6, 18)>
4. Nodes 5, 3, and 19 form a 3-star. <3, (5, 12, 19)>
5. Nodes 13, 15, and 25 form a 3-star. <15, (27, 12, 25)>
6. Nodes 1, 10, and 26 form a 3-star. <1, (10, 18, 26)>
7. Nodes 28, 20, and 2 form a 3-star. <20, (6, 8, 28)>
8. Nodes 14, 22, and 17 form a 3-star. <14, (22, 0, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
