Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (6, 1, 3)>  
2. <1, (9, 2, 0)>
3. <2, (9, 1, 8)>
4. <3, (7, 0, 4)>
5. <4, (9, 3)>
6. <5, (6, 8, 7)>
7. <6, (9, 5, 0)>
8. <7, (9, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (9, 1, 5)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 4)>

Hence, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
