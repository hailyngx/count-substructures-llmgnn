Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 14, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 10, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 10, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 13, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 11, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 11, 8, 0, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 10)>
<4, (12, 10, 14)>
<5, (7, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 1, 6)>
<9, (11, 8, 0)>
<10, (4, 3, 12)>
<11, (7, 9, 13)>
<12, (4, 10, 13)>
<13, (1, 11, 5)>
<14, (4, 5, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have: 
[13]
