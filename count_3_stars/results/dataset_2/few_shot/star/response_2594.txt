Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 5: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- From node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- From node 0: <0, (6, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
