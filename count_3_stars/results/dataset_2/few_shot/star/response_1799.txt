Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Looking at the given adjacency list for each node, we can see that there are no complete 3-stars involving a central node and exactly three connected nodes. This means that the given graph does not contain any 3-stars.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
