Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 9, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify and list these unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows (in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>):

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
