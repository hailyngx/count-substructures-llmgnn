Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. 
A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
1. <14, (17, 28, 2)>
2. <17, (14, 6, 9)>
3. <1, (3, 11, 16)>
4. <3, (1, 24, 10)>
5. <10, (3, 11, 22)>
6. <11, (1, 10, 13)>
7. <20, (25, 29, 18)>
8. <12, (27, 4, 8)>
9. <27, (12, 21, 19)>
10. <2, (14, 16, -)>
11. <29, (14, 20, 9)>
12. <4, (12, 0, 15)>
13. <16, (1, 3, 2)>
14. <6, (17, 22, -)>
15. <23, (18, 24, -)>
16. <24, (3, 29, 18)>
17. <19, (17, 27, 24)>
18. <0, (4, 8, -)>
19. <15, (4, 13, -)>
20. <21, (27, 28, -)>
21. <13, (11, 15, -)>
22. <26, (17, 11, -)>
23. <5, (27, -, -)>
24. <18, (20, 23, -)>
25. <25, (11, 20, -)>

There are 25 unique 3-star patterns in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
