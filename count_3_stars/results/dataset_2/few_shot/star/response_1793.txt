Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
   1 -- 2
  / \   / \
 6 - 5 - 8 - 3
  \ /   \ /
   9 -- 4
    \   /
     0 - 7
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by checking the 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: (4, 8, 7)
- Node 1: (5, 2, 6)
- Node 2: (5, 1, 6)
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: (5, 9, 8)
- Node 5: (2, 1, 6), (2, 4, 8), (8, 6, 1), (8, 4, 5)
- Node 6: (1, 5, 2), (1, 8, 5), (2, 5, 1), (2, 8, 5)
- Node 7: (9, 6, 0), (9, 8, 7)
- Node 8: (3, 5, 4), (5, 1, 6), (5, 2, 1), (5, 4, 8), (8, 4, 5), (8, 6, 5), (8, 7, 6)
- Node 9: (4, 8, 7), (6, 1, 5), (6, 2, 5), (6, 8, 5)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 2, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (8, 6, 1)>, <5, (8, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 2)>, <6, (1, 8, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 1)>, <6, (2, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 3)>, <8, (5, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (5, 4, 8)>, <8, (8, 4, 5)>, <8, (8, 6, 5)>, <8, (8, 7, 6)>, <9, (4, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 5)>, <9, (6, 2, 5)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
