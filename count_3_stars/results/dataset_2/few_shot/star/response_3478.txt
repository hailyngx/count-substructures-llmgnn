Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (16, 12, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 15)>
<2, (3, 16, 19)>
<3, (18, 11, 16)>
<4, (9, 13, 1)>
<5, (11, 7, 17)>
<6, (17, 18, 7)>
<7, (18, 10, 5)>
<8, (1, 15, 0)>
<9, (0, 13, 4)>
<10, (7, 19, 13)>
<11, (17, 3, 5)>
<12, (14, 16, 13)>
<13, (4, 2, 10)>
<14, (17, 12, 0)>
<15, (17, 8, 1)>
<16, (0, 12, 3)>
<17, (14, 15, 6)>
<18, (4, 7, 3)>
<19, (2, 10, 6)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
