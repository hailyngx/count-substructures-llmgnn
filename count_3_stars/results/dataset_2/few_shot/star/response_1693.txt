Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (23, 3, 25)>
<1, (28, 17, 25)>
<2, (17, 19, 3)>
<3, (13, 28, 0)>
<4, (13, 8, 6)>
<5, (9, 19, 20)>
<6, (24, 4, 20)>
<7, (18, 17, 15)>
<8, (24, 4, 29)>
<10, (13, 21, 14)>
<11, (26, 14, 27)>
<12, (16, 15)>
<16, (26, 12, 27)>
<17, (21, 1, 2)>
<18, (22)>
<19, (5, 21, 2)>
<20, (5, 24, 28)>
<21, (28, 10, 27)>
<22, (13, 18, 29)>
<23, (13)>
<24, (6, 8)>
<25, (1)>
<26, (11)>
<27, (21, 16, 11)>
<28, (21, 3, 20)>
<29, (22, 8, 11)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
