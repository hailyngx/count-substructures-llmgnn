Response:
The central nodes in the 3-stars can be any node with exactly 3 connected nodes. Let's identify these central nodes first:
1. Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes (7, 9, 10, 3).
2. Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (6, 12, 3).
3. Node 10 is connected to 3 other nodes (6, 8, 27).
4. Node 12 is connected to 4 other nodes (7, 5, 25, 23).
5. Node 13 is connected to 2 other nodes (15, 4).
6. Node 14 is connected to 2 other nodes (16, 11).
7. Node 15 is connected to 3 other nodes (22, 13, 4).
8. Node 17 is connected to 4 other nodes (29, 19, 2, 21).
9. Node 19 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 17, 22, 11).
10. Node 25 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 12, 2, 5).
11. Node 27 is connected to 5 other nodes (10, 23, 5, 21, 18).
12. Node 29 is connected to 3 other nodes (17, 0, 18).

Based on the central nodes identified, we can list the unique 3-stars:
1. <6, (7, 9, 10)>
2. <6, (3, 7, 12)>
3. <7, (6, 3, 12)>
4. <10, (6, 8, 27)>
5. <12, (7, 5, 25)>
6. <13, (15, 4, 0)>
7. <14, (16, 11, 2)>
8. <15, (22, 13, 4)>
9. <17, (29, 19, 2)>
10. <19, (9, 17, 22)>
11. <25, (9, 12, 2)>
12. <27, (10, 23, 5)>
13. <29, (17, 0, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
