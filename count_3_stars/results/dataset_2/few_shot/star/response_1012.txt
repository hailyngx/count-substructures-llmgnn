Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 3. <2, (9, 7, 3)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 4. <5, (9, 8, 4)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 3. <8, (5, 7, 3)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
