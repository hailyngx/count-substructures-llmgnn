Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 13, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 13, 14, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 13, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 11, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 12, 10, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 13, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 14, 10, 11, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 11, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 7, 12, 8, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, 14, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 4, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, 4, and node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<0, (9, 11, 13)>
<1, (2, 13, 14)>
<2, (6, 13, 1)>
<3, (6, 8, 11)>
<4, (9, 12, 10)>
<5, (13, 5, 10)>
<6, (2, 3, 14)>
<7, (10, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 11, 14)>
<9, (0, 4, 11)>
<10, (5, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 8, 14)>
<12, (4, 10, 14)>
<13, (0, 1, 5)>
<14, (6, 8, 4)>

Count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [15].
