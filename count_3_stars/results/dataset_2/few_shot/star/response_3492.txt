Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 15, 18)>
<1, (14, 8, 12)>
<2, (17, 8, 19)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (0, 12)>
<5, (11, 19, 18)>
<6, (13, 15)>
<7, (2, 0, 18)>
<8, (17, 13, 2)>
<9, (14, 13, 7)>
<10, (15)>
<11, (5, 12)>
<12, (11, 4, 1)>
<13, (8, 16, 9)>
<14, (17, 1, 9)>
<15, (0, 10, 6)>
<16, (13, 15)>
<17, (14, 8, 2)>
<18, (0, 7, 19)>
<19, (2, 5, 18)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

[19]
