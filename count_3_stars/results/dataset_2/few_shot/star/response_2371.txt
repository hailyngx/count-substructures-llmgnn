Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in the specific star pattern described earlier.

First, let's identify the nodes' degrees based on the provided edges:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

Next, we will find all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 14, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 1, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 12)>
<3, (1, 5, 10)>
<3, (5, 6, 10)>
<3, (5, 10,13)>
<4, (1, 2, 12)>
<4, (2, 6, 12)>
<4, (2, 12, 13)>
<5, (1, 3, 10)>
<5, (1, 6, 14)>
<5, (3, 6, 10)>
<5, (3, 10, 13)>
<5, (6, 8, 11)>
<5, (6, 10, 13)>
<5, (10, 13, 14)>
<6, (2, 3, 11)>
<6, (2, 11, 12)>
<6, (3, 5, 10)>
<6, (5, 11, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 11)>
<8, (0, 5, 14)>
<8, (5, 9, 11)>
<8, (5, 11, 14)>
<8, (9, 10, 14)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<9, (8, 10, 14)>
<10, (3, 9, 13)>
<10, (5, 6, 13)>
<10, (6, 9, 10)>
<10, (9, 13, 14)>
<12, (2, 4, 13)>
<12, (4, 11, 12)>
<12, (11, 13, 12)>
<13, (5, 10, 14)>
<13, (6, 9, 10)>
<13, (9, 10, 14)>
<14, (0, 8, 9)>
<14, (5, 8, 9)>
<14, (8, 9, 10)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [39] 3-stars in the graph.
