Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 6:
    <0, (4, 8, 6)>

2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, and 8:
    <1, (7, 2, 8)>

3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 0:
    <2, (1, 3, 0)>

4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 6:
    <3, (5, 9, 6)>

5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 6:
    <4, (9, 7, 6)>

6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 7:
    <6, (5, 4, 7)>

7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 0:
    <8, (9, 1, 0)>

8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 3:
    <9, (8, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
