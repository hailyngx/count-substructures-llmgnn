Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. Check each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a 3-star:
   - Node 0: Not a center.
   - Node 1: Not a center.
   - Node 2: Possible 3-star with center Node 2 and leaves 6, 7, 14. <2, (6, 7, 14)>
   - Node 3: Not a center.
   - Node 4: Possible 3-star with center Node 4 and leaves 6, 10, 12. <4, (6, 10, 12)>
   - Node 5: Not a center.
   - Node 6: Possible 3-star with center Node 6 and leaves 9, 10, 2. <6, (9, 10, 2)>
   - Node 7: Not a center.
   - Node 8: Possible 3-star with center Node 8 and leaves 9, 11, 0. <8, (9, 11, 0)>
   - Node 9: Not a center.
   - Node 10: Not a center.
   - Node 11: Not a center.
   - Node 12: Possible 3-star with center Node 12 and leaves 9, 11, 7. <12, (9, 11, 7)>
   - Node 13: Not a center.
   - Node 14: Not a center.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <2, (6, 7, 14)>
   - <4, (6, 10, 12)>
   - <6, (9, 10, 2)>
   - <8, (9, 11, 0)>
   - <12, (9, 11, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
