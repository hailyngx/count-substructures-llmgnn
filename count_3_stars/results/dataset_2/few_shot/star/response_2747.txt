Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, 14, and node 10
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 13, 3, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 14, 11, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 13, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 11, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 14, 13, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 14, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 0, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 5, 12, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 1, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 7, 13, 0, 2, and node 10

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as those nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 6: connected to nodes 3, 11, and 4
- Node 9: connected to nodes 14, 1, and 10
- Node 11: connected to nodes 6, 5, and 12
- Node 12: connected to nodes 1 and 11
- Node 10: connected to nodes 0 and 14

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 6: <6, (3, 11, 4)>
- For Node 9: <9, (14, 1, 10)>
- For Node 11: <11, (6, 5, 12)>
- For Node 12: <12, (1, 11)>
- For Node 10: <10, (0, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
