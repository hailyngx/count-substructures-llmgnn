Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (8, 0, 5)>
2. <8, (13, 5, 14)>
3. <13, (10, 1, 5)>
4. <10, (11, 7, 4)>
5. <11, (10, 9, 4)>
6. <7, (10, 12, 5)>
7. <12, (11, 7, 1)>
8. <0, (12, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
