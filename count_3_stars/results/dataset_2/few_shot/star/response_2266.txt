Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify all unique 3-stars. 

From the provided adjacency list, we can see the connections of each node. Now, let's list all 3-stars in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars [10].
