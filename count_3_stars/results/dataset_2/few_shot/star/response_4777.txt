Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to each node.
- For each node, we can look for combinations of three connected nodes to form a 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (27, 29, 19)>
<1, (3, 13, 12)>
<2, (15, 9, 2)>
<3, (15, 1, 23)>
<4, (3, 15, 11)>
<5, (29, 13, 11)>
<6, (15, 13, 6)>
<8, (3, 28, 18)>
<9, (20, 18, 16)>
<10, (23, 29, 13)>
<11, (17, 5, 4)>
<13, (1, 26, 5)>
<14, (28, 16, 14)>
<15, (3, 6, 4)>
<17, (20, 23, 11)>
<18, (26, 9, 8)>
<19, (0, 27, 8)>
<20, (17, 9, 20)>
<21, (26, 25, 21)>
<22, (23, 26, 22)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [20]
