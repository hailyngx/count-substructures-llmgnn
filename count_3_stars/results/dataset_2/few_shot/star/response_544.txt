Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 1

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of times a node appears as the center in a 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars: 
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with (6, 1, 9), (1, 4, 5), and (1, 3, 6).
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with (6, 2, 9), (7, 2, 8), and (2, 5, 0).
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with (6, 1, 3).
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with (6, 4, 7), (4, 5, 8), and (1, 4, 6).
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with (4, 5, 8), (5, 1, 3), and (2, 5, 0).
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with (1, 6, 4).
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with (1, 9, 2).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 1, 9)>
<1, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (7, 2, 8)>
<2, (2, 5, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (5, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 6, 4)>
<9, (1, 9, 2)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [15].
