Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star in the graph and count them.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 2, 1)>
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<1, (8, 0, 7)>
<3, (9, 2, 4)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
