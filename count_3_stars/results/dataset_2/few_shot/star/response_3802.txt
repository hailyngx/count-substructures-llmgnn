Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a 3-star pattern, where one node is connected to three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph and count them:

1. <0, (9, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (5, 3, 4)>
3. <1, (5, 3, 8)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 3)>
5. <3, (1, 7, 4)>
6. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
7. <4, (1, 7, 3)>
8. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
9. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
10. <7, (5, 6, 3)>
11. <8, (6, 1, 7)>

Thus, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
