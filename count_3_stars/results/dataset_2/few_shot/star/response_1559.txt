Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find all possible 3-stars by examining each node as a potential center:

1. Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 8)> 
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 8, 7)> 
3. Node 2: <2, (7, 3, 8)> 
4. Node 3: <3, (7, 6, 9)> 
5. Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 0)> 
6. Node 5: <5, (7, 1, 6)> 
7. Node 6: <6, (7, 3, 5)> 
8. Node 7: <7, (4, 3, 5)> 
9. Node 8: <8, (4, 1, 9)> 
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 8, -)>  [Note: Node 9 has only one connection]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
