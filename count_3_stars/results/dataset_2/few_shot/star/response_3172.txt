Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By reviewing the adjacency list for each node and the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (8, 0, 6)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 2)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 0)>

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
