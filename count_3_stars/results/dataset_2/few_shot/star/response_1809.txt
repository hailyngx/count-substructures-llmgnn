Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 2

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to determine the number of unique 3-stars it contains:

- From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node:
    - Node 0: (6, 1, 2, 7, 5)
    - Node 1: (3, 5, 4, 0, 8)
    - Node 2: (9, 3, 5, 0)
    - Node 3: (6, 1, 7, 2, 8)
    - Node 4: (6, 9, 1)
    - Node 5: (1, 2, 8, 0)
    - Node 6: (7, 3, 4, 0)
    - Node 7: (6, 3, 8, 0)
    - Node 8: (1, 3, 5, 7)
    - Node 9: (4, 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
We can see the following 3-stars: <0, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, and <5, (1, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
