Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 3: (15, 2, 8), (15, 7, 1), (15, 16, 10)
2. Node 6: (14, 7, 13)
3. Node 7: (15, 4, 14), (15, 8, 2), (15, 16, 10)
4. Node 13: (6, 14, 7), (6, 17, 19)
5. Node 14: (7, 4, 18), (7, 10, 16), (7, 14, 19)
6. Node 15: (3, 7, 1), (3, 8, 16), (3, 10, 14)
7. Node 16: (15, 9, 16), (15, 10, 14), (15, 7, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
