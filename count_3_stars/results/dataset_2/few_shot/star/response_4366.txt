Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 7, and node 1

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

We will first identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 
A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 1)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
