Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - Node 0: No adjacent edges, so no 3-star.
   - Node 1: <1, (14, 7, 12)>
   - Node 2: No 3-star.
   - Node 3: No 3-star.
   - Node 4: <4, (23, 15, 28)>
   - Node 5: No 3-star.
   - Node 6: No 3-star.
   - Node 7: <7, (14, 1, 11)>
   - Node 8: No 3-star.
   - Node 9: No 3-star.
   - Node 10: No 3-star.
   - Node 11: <11, (5, 20, 24)>
   - Node 12: No 3-star.
   - Node 13: No 3-star.
   - Node 14: <14, (17, 18, 7)>
   - Node 15: No 3-star.
   - Node 16: No 3-star.
   - Node 17: No 3-star.
   - Node 18: No 3-star.
   - Node 19: No 3-star.
   - Node 20: No 3-star.
   - Node 21: No 3-star.
   - Node 22: No 3-star.
   - Node 23: No 3-star.
   - Node 24: No 3-star.
   - Node 25: No 3-star.
   - Node 26: No 3-star.
   - Node 27: No 3-star.
   - Node 28: No 3-star.
   - Node 29: No 3-star.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 2

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   <1, (14, 7, 12)>, <4, (23, 15, 28)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
