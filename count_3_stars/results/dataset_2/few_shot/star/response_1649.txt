Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star individually. 

Let's go through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). 

Here are the 3-stars identified:
<2, (8, 16, 11)>
<3, (17, 5, 0)>
<4, (12, 1, 15)>
<6, (17, 7, 13)>
<8, (2, 16, 15)>
<10, (1, 9, 13)>
<11, (17, 2, 12)>
<13, (14, 19, 6)>
<15, (8, 4, 12)>
<17, (14, 6, 3)>
<19, (2, 1, 13)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
