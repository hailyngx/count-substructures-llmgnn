Response:
We can find the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying nodes which have exactly three neighbors and the neighbors are not connected to each other. Let's go node by node:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 15, 13, and 6. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 13, and 16. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 6. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors but they are all connected to each other.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 19, 14, and 7. Node 3 is part of a 3-star: <3, (10, 14, 19)>.

Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 15. Node 4 is part of two 3-stars: <4, (8, 10, 15)> and <4, (8, 10, 15)>.

Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 1, and 7. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 0. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors but they are all connected to each other.

Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 3. Node 7 is part of a 3-star: <7, (5, 17, 3)>.

Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 18. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 1. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 4, and 14. Node 10 is part of a 3-star: <10, (3, 4, 14)>.

Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 17. Node 11 is part of a 3-star: <11, (6, 10, 17)>.

Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and 14. Node 12 is not part of any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors but they are all connected to each other.

Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 17, and 1. Node 13 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 3. Node 14 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 15 is connected to nodes 4 and 0. Node 15 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 16 is connected to nodes 17 and 1. Node 16 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 16, and 7. Node 17 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.

Node 18 is connected to node 8. Node 18 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 19 is connected to nodes 3 and 12. Node 19 is not part of any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
[<3, (10, 14, 19)>, <4, (8, 10, 15)>, <7, (5, 17, 3)>, <10, (3, 4, 14)>, <11, (6, 10, 17)>]
