Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

For a 3-star to exist, there must be a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can find the 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors to check for this pattern. 

Based on the given information and adjacency list, the following 3-stars are found:
<0, (9, 3, 15)>
<1, (13, 10, 19)>
<2, (9, 10, 18)>
<3, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 17, 2)>
<5, (14)>
<6, (14, 4, 16)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (13)>
<9, (2, 14, 7)>
<10, (17, 1, 2)>
<11, (17, 19, 15)>
<12, (13, 18, 3)>
<13, (8, 12, 1)>
<14, (6, 9, 13)>
<15, (11)>
<16, (6)>
<17, (10, 11, 4)>
<18, (2, 19, 12)>
<19, (18, 11, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and output the final answer inside brackets [20]. The unique 3-stars found are listed in <> above.
