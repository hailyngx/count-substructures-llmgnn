Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph.
Let's count the number of 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Count the number of nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 5, 9, 12, 14, 16, 24 have exactly 3 neighbors each.

2. For each of the nodes identified in step 1, count the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
- Node 5 is a part of one 3-star: <5, (9, 12, 16)>
- Node 9 is a part of one 3-star: <9, (5, 3, 7)>
- Node 12 is a part of one 3-star: <12, (5, 20, 29)>
- Node 14 is a part of one 3-star: <14, (5, 16, 28)>
- Node 16 is a part of one 3-star: <16, (5, 14, 29)>
- Node 24 is not a part of any 3-star.

3. Sum up the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
Total number of unique 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (9, 12, 16)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <12, (5, 20, 29)>, <14, (5, 16, 28)>, <16, (5, 14, 29)>.
