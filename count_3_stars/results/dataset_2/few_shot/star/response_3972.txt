Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see the following 3-star configurations: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 6)>
<3, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 10. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
