Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

**3-Stars:**
<4, (7, 18, 28)>
<7, (4, 28, 18)>
<18, (4, 7, 8)>
<22, (18, 16, 10)>
<20, (0, 14, 21)>
<25, (8, 15, 21)>
<3, (28, 0, 24)>
<6, (9, 5, 27)>
<9, (6, 2, 27)>
<0, (20, 14, 3)>
<28, (7, 18, 13)>
<29, (1, 26, 15)>
<14, (20, 0, 13)>
<1, (29, 26, 15)>
<26, (1, 16, 29)>
<2, (9, 0, 19)>
<17, (12, 21, 5)>
<5, (6, 12, 21)>
<11, (19, 2, 26)>
<23, (16, 10, 22)>
<12, (17, 5, 13)>
<16, (22, 26, 24)>
<24, (3, 0, 16)>
<19, (2, 11, 26)>
<13, (28, 14, 12)>
<21, (20, 25, 17)>
<15, (25, 29, 1)>
<27, (9, 5, 6)>
<8, (18, 22, 25)>
<10, (22, 5, 23)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 
There are 30 unique 3-stars in the graph as calculated above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **[30]**.
