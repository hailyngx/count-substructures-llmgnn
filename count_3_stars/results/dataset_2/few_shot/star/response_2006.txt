Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
