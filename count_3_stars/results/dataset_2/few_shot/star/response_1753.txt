Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Okay, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
