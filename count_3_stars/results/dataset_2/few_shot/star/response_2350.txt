Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. If it is, then form a 3-star with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

3. Count the total number of such 3-stars in the graph.

Let's follow these steps:

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (7, 12, 9)>
<1, (5, 14, 10)>
<2, (8, 9, 11)>
<3, (0, 10, 9)>
<4, (11, 0, 9)>
<5, (1, 11, 14)>
<6, (7, 12, 8)>
<7, (6, 12, 14)>
<8, (6, 12, 2)>
<9, (2, 8, 3)>
<10, (3, 1, 4)>
<11, (5, 2, 14)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
<13, (6, 11, 9)>
<14, (7, 12, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
