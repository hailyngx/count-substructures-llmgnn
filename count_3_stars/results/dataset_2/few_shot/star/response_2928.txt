Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, the 3-stars can be identified based on the definition that each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (8, 3, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (8, 4, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
  
[<1, (5, 9, 2)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <4, (8, 3, 6)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <6, (8, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>]
