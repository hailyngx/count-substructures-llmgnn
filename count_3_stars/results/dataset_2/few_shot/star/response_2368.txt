Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 3)

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
Central nodes: 6, 8, 11

Step 2: For each central node, identify the nodes connected to it which form 3-stars.
For central node 6, the 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (14, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>

For central node 8, there are no 3-stars since it only has one edge connected.

For central node 11, there is no 3-star since it only has two edges connected.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.
Total number of unique 3-stars: 4
