Response:
Let's analyze the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. (0, 17, 19)
2. (1, 2, 16)
3. (1, 6, 13)
4. (1, 11, 19)
5. (2, 16, 17)
6. (3, 4, 19)
7. (5, 8, 14)
8. (6, 7, 17)
9. (8, 13, 15)
10. (10, 12, 18)
11. (10, 7, 17)
12. (14, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 19)>
<1, (2, 16)>
<1, (6, 13)>
<1, (11, 19)>
<2, (16, 17)>
<3, (4, 19)>
<5, (8, 14)>
<6, (7, 17)>
<8, (13, 15)>
<10, (12, 18)>
<10, (7, 17)>
<14, (4, 6)>
