Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 9, 4)>
3. <2, (5, 9, *)> (Here, * can be either 1 or 9)
4. <3, (4, 1, *)> (Here, * can be either 6 or 4)
5. <5, (6, 1, 2)>
6. <6, (5, 1, 3)>
7. <7, (9, 0, 8)>
8. <8, (9, 7, 0)>
9. <9, (5, 1, 0)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the graph.
