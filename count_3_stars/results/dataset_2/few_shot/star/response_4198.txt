Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting from each node in the graph, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. These are the centers of potential 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph with their central node and connected nodes:

<10, (5, 4, 12)>
<4, (5, 9, 10)>
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 14)>
<13, (8, 11, 1)>
<14, (4, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
