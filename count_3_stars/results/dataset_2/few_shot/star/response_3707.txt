Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:
The potential central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 13

For node 0:
- <0, (7, 1, 8)>
- <0, (7, 1, 11)>
- <0, (7, 1, 6)>
- <0, (7, 8, 11)>
- <0, (7, 11, 14)>
- <0, (1, 8, 11)>
- <0, (1, 11, 14)>
- <0, (8, 11, 14)>
Total 3-stars involving node 0: 8

For node 1:
- <1, (3, 14, 10)>
- <1, (3, 14, 13)>
- <1, (3, 10, 13)>
- <1, (14, 10, 13)>
- <1, (10, 2, 14)>
Total 3-stars involving node 1: 5

For node 2:
- No 3-star as it's only connected to two other nodes.

For node 4:
- <4, (9, 12, 14)>
Total 3-stars involving node 4: 1

For node 5:
- <5, (9, 3, 7)>
Total 3-stars involving node 5: 1

For node 6:
- <6, (3, 0, 10)>
Total 3-stars involving node 6: 1

For node 8:
- No 3-star as it's only connected to two other nodes.

For node 11:
- <11, (12, 0, 14)>
Total 3-stars involving node 11: 1

For node 13:
- <13, (1, 3, 12)>
Total 3-stars involving node 13: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
