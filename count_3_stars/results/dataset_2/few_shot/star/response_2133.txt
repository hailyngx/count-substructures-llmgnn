Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars by looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then count the number of such unique 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, we will list its neighbors in descending order of the degree of the neighboring nodes. If a node has multiple neighbors with the same degree, we will list them in lexicographically increasing order.

2. Identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These central nodes will form the center of 3-stars.

3. For each central node, list the three connected nodes around it as part of the 3-star.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)> 
<2, (4, 5, 6)> 

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is [3].
