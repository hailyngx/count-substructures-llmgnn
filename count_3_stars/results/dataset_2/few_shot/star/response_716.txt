Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then list each unique 3-star found.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 7, 9, and 17)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4, 9, and 12)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 7, 15, and 19)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 6, 16, and 19)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (4, 9, 12)>
<10, (7, 15, 19)>
<14, (6, 16, 19)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
