Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 14. Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 11, 14)>
2. <1, (0, 13, 14)>
3. <2, (3, 9, 12)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 12)>
6. <5, (4, 9, 10)>
7. <6, (8, 10, 13)>
8. <7, (3, 11, 14)>
9. <8, (6, 9, 13)>
10. <9, (2, 5, 8)>
11. <10, (2, 5, 6)>
12. <11, (0, 7, 14)>
13. <12, (2, 3, 4)>
14. <13, (1, 6, 8)>
15. <14, (0, 1, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
