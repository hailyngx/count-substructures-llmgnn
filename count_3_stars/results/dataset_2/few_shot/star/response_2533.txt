Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of ways a node can be the center node of a 3-star. Each node that is the center of a 3-star will be connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 7, 6)>

Therefore, there are **10 unique 3-stars** in the given graph.
