Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the unique occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars one by one:
1. <1, (2, 21, 17)>
2. <1, (2, 21, 10)>
3. <1, (2, 10, 17)>
4. <1, (21, 3, 2)>
5. <1, (21, 3, 18)>
6. <1, (21, 2, 7)>
7. <2, (13, 21, 1)>
8. <2, (13, 21, 7)>
9. <2, (13, 1, 21)>
10. <2, (1, 21, 3)>
11. <2, (1, 21, 7)>
12. <4, (9, 11, 16)>
13. <4, (11, 9, 8)>
14. <4, (11, 8, 17)>
15. <4, (16, 12, 9)>
16. <4, (16, 12, 20)>
17. <4, (16, 12, 4)>
18. <5, (9, 0, 27)>
19. <5, (0, 5, 14)>
20. <9, (5, 4, 11)>
21. <9, (5, 4, 12)>
22. <12, (9, 20, 16)>
23. <12, (20, 13, 15)>
24. <12, (20, 13, 22)>
25. <14, (0, 24, 29)>
26. <14, (0, 24, 18)>
27. <16, (28, 19, 10)>
28. <19, (16, 28, 12)>
29. <19, (16, 28, 11)>
30. <23, (10, 19, 28)>
31. <23, (15, 20, 13)>
32. <23, (15, 20, 12)>
33. <24, (0, 18, 3)>
34. <24, (0, 18, 29)>
35. <25, (22, 25, 14)>
