Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 13, 14)>
<2, (6, 10, 17)>
<3, (1, 4, 16)>
<4, (3, 5, 16)>
<5, (4, 12, 8)>
<6, (2, 10, 14)>
<7, (0, 17, 11)>
<8, (5, 13, 16)>
<9, (14)>
<11, (7, 16, 17)>
<12, (5, 19)>
<13, (1, 8, 17)>
<14, (1, 6, 15)>
<15, (14, 18, 10)>
<16, (3, 8, 11)>
<17, (2, 7, 13)>
<18, (15, 19)>
<19, (8, 10, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
