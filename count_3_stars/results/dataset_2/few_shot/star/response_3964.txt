Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. From the adjacency list provided, we see that nodes 11, 14, 22, and 27 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. These nodes can potentially serve as the center of a 3-star.

2. For each of these nodes, we identify the nodes they are connected to. Based on the connections, we list the unique 3-stars:

   <11, (16, 14, 22)>
   <14, (11, 25, 10)>
   <22, (11, 27, 27)>
   <27, (22, 5, 23)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4].

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
