Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its three connected nodes. Then we can count the unique 3-stars. 

The 3-star structures in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
