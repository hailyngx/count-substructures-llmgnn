Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars present in it.

We can represent the graph with its adjacency list as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 6, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 6: {1, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 9, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {9, 5}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 6, 8, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (7, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 5)>
<5, (7, 8, 2)>
<9, (7, 1, 6)>
