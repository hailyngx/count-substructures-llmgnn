Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
1. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. We will consider each node as the central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Counting 3-stars:
- For Node 0: (0, 5, 7, 1) is a 3-star. <0, (5, 7, 1)>
- For Node 1: (1, 4, 3, 6) is a 3-star. <1, (4, 3, 6)>
- For Node 2: (2, 9, 1, 3) is a 3-star. <2, (9, 1, 3)>
- For Node 3: (3, 5, 1, 0) is a 3-star. <3, (5, 1, 0)>
- For Node 4: No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
- For Node 5: (5, 9, 6, 0) is a 3-star. <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
- For Node 7: No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
- For Node 8: (8, 9, 3, 7) is a 3-star. <8, (9, 3, 7)>
- For Node 9: (9, 5, 8, 2) is a 3-star. <9, (5, 8, 2)>

Count of 3-stars = 6
