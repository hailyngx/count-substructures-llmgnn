Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node. 

Let's go through each node and its connections:

Node 0: (1, 9)
Node 1: (7, 19, 15, 0) - forms <1, (7, 19, 15)>
Node 2: (4, 8, 3) - forms <2, (4, 8, 3)>
Node 3: (11, 2, 9, 5) - forms <3, (11, 2, 9)>
Node 4: (13, 2) - no 3-star
Node 5: (11, 3, 19, 12) - forms <5, (11, 3, 19)>
Node 6: (7, 15, 13) - forms <6, (7, 15, 13)>
Node 7: (6, 10, 14, 1) - forms <7, (6, 10, 14)>
Node 8: (2, 16) - no 3-star
Node 9: (11, 3, 0) - no 3-star
Node 10: (7, 11, 12) - forms <10, (7, 11, 12)>
Node 11: (10, 3, 9, 5) - forms <11, (10, 3, 9)>
Node 12: (10, 5) - no 3-star
Node 13: (4, 18, 6) - forms <13, (4, 18, 6)>
Node 14: (7, 17) - no 3-star
Node 15: (1, 18, 6) - forms <15, (1, 18, 6)>
Node 16: (8, 19, 18) - forms <16, (8, 19, 18)>
Node 17: (14) - no 3-star
Node 18: (19, 15, 16, 13) - forms <18, (19, 15, 16)>
Node 19: (5, 18, 1, 16) - forms <19, (5, 18, 1)>

Counting the 3-stars found:
[<1, (7, 19, 15)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <5, (11, 3, 19)>, <6, (7, 15, 13)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <10, (7, 11, 12)>, <11, (10, 3, 9)>, <13, (4, 18, 6)>, <15, (1, 18, 6)>, <16, (8, 19, 18)>, <18, (19, 15, 16)>, <19, (5, 18, 1)>]
