Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first note that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given graph, we can see that a central node can have 3 neighbors at most.

Let's now identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (9, 2, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (10, 1, 11)>
<5, (6, 1, 13)>
<6, (9, 5, 11)>
<7, (3, 14, 13)>
<8, (9, 3, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 0)>
<11, (4, 6, 12)>
<12, (6, 8, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 0)>
<14, (7, 5, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
