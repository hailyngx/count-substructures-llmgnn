Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 14, 11)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 8, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (15, 17, 8)> and <2, (15, 17, 13)>
- Node 3: <3, (15, 11, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (13, 11, 17)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 17)>, <5, (9, 17, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 14)>, <5, (0, 14, 7)>
- Node 6: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 7: <7, (5, 3, 19)>
- Node 8: <8, (10, 2, 1)>, <8, (10, 2, 18)>, <8, (10, 1, 18)>
- Node 9: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 10: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 11: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 12: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 13: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 14: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 15: <15, (3, 17, 2)>
- Node 16: N/A (Not connected to any other nodes)
- Node 17: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 18: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 19: N/A (Not connected to 3 nodes)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 14, 11)>, <1, (2, 8, 11)>, <2, (15, 17, 8)>, <2, (15, 17, 13)>, <3, (15, 11, 7)>, <4, (13, 11, 17)>, <5, (9, 6, 17)>, <5, (9, 17, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 14)>, <5, (0, 14, 7)>.
