Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- For Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 6, 8)> and <9, (5, 6, 4)>.
