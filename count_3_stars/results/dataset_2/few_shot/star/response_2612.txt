Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's list down the 3-star configurations with the center node first, followed by the nodes connected to it (leaves):
<3, (11, 14, 19)>
<5, (7, 9, 10)>
<9, (5, 12, 14)>
<10, (5, 14, 16)>
<11, (3, 4, 19)>
<12, (8, 9, 15)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
<15, (12, 13, 15)>
<16, (10, 17, 16)>
<18, (8, 9, 18)>

Count of 3-stars: 
[10]
