Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each possible 3-star configuration where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (2, 0, 3)>
<6, (4, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
