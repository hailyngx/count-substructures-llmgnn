Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 18) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph. 

Let's list down the possible 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (1, 2, 10)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 11)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 15)>
4. <3, (8, 10, 13)>
5. <4, (12, 14, 17)>
6. <5, (2, 9, 17)>
7. <6, (0, 7, 18)>
8. <7, (6, 10, 18)>
9. <8, (3, 13, 19)>
10. <9, (5, 13, 15)>
11. <10, (2, 3, 7)>
12. <11, (1, 2, 12)>
13. <12, (4, 11, 14)>
14. <13, (3, 8, 9)>
15. <14, (12, 15, 16)>
16. <15, (2, 9, 14)>
17. <16, (12, 14)>
18. <17, (4, 5, 18)>
19. <18, (6, 17)>
20. <19, (8, 15)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-star patterns in the graph. 

The final answer is [20].
