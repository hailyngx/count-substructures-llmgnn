Response:
The number of 3-star graphs can be found by counting the number of configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
Node 5 (connected to nodes 11, 7, and 14)
Node 7 (connected to nodes 5, 11, and 6)
Node 8 (connected to nodes 9 and 6)

Now we can count the number of 3-star graphs centered at each of these nodes.

For Node 5:
- <5, (11, 7, 14)>
- <5, (11, 7, 14)>
- <5, (11, 7, 14)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (5, 11, 6)>
- <7, (5, 11, 6)>
- <7, (5, 11, 6)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (9, 6, 8)>

Counting all unique configurations gives us a total of [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
