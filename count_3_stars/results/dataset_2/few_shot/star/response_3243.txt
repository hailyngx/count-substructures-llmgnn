Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<5, (1, 9, 4)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
