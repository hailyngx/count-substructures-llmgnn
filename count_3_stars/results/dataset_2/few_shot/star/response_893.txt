Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (13, 0) (13, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 10, 11, 4, 8, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 12, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 14, 12, 10, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 10, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 14, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 11, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 11, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 14, 12, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 7
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 4, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, 9, and node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, (14, 10, 11)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 14, 12)>
<3, (14, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 12, 13)>
<5, (1, 7, 14)>
<6, (2, 14, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 11)>
<8, (6, 0, 11)>
<9, (14, 3, 1)>
<10, (5, 0, 3)>
<11, (0, 8, 7)>
<12, (2, 4, 3)>
<13, (0, 4, 13)>
<14, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
