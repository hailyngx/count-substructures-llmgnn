Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:  

1. **Identify Center Nodes**: First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-stars.  
    - From the adjacency list, the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

2. **Forming 3-stars**: For each of the potential center nodes identified in the previous step, we will check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by verifying if they are connected to exactly three other nodes forming edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (5, 4, 7)>
- From node 1: <1, (3, 0, 8)>
- From node 2: <2, (6, 8, 7)>
- From node 3: <3, (7, 1, 0)>
- From node 9: <9, (6, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of **5** 3-stars in the given graph.  
The answer is: **[5]**
