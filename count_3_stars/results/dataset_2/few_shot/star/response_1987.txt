Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes via edges. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and list down all unique 3-stars.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (4, 8, 18)>
<2, (11, 15, 19)>
<3, (4, 15, 17)>
<4, (1, 3, 12)>
<5, (0, 6, 16)>
<6, (5, 8, 17)>
<9, (10, 13, 14)>
<10, (12, 13, 18)>
<11, (2, 6, 17)>
<12, (0, 4, 18)>
<13, (0, 9, 10)>
<14, (9, 10, 13)>
<15, (2, 3, 19)>
<16, (5)>
<17, (3, 6, 11)>
<18, (1, 10, 19)>
<19, (11, 15, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
<1, (4, 8, 18)>, <2, (11, 15, 19)>, <3, (4, 15, 17)>, <4, (1, 3, 12)>, <5, (0, 6, 16)>, <6, (5, 8, 17)>, <9, (10, 13, 14)>, <10, (12, 13, 18)>, <11, (2, 6, 17)>, <12, (0, 4, 18)>, <13, (0, 9, 10)>, <14, (9, 10, 13)>, <15, (2, 3, 19)>, <16, (5)>, <17, (3, 6, 11)>, <18, (1, 10, 19)>
