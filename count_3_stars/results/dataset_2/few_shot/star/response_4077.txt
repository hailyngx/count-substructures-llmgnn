Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list and the edges, we can identify the following 3-star subgraphs:
<0, (9, 1, 11)>
<1, (3, 4, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 14)>
<3, (6, 1, 14)>
<4, (1, 13, 2)>
<5, (3, 8, 12)>
<6, (3, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 12, 5)>
<8, (5, 14, 3)>
<9, (11, 10, 0)>
<10, (9, 3, 13)>
<11, (9, 1, 12)>
<12, (6, 13, 7)>
<13, (4, 10, 14)>
<14, (3, 8, 13)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
