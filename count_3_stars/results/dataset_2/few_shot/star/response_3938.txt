Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided graph, we can start by examining each node's connections to identify the 3-star patterns. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 1: (1, (2, 10, 19)), (1, (2, 10, 12))
2. Node 2: (2, (1, 5, 17)), (2, (1, 5, 3))
3. Node 3: (3, (5, 8, 2)), (3, (5, 8, 6))
4. Node 5: (5, (2, 3, 7)), (5, (2, 3, 8)), (5, (7, 11, 15))
5. Node 6: (6, (8, 15, 12)), (6, (8, 15, 13)), (6, (8, 15, 7)), (6, (8, 15, 6))
6. Node 7: (7, (5, 11, 15)), (7, (5, 11, 19))
7. Node 8: (8, (3, 6, 15)), (8, (3, 6, 13)), (8, (3, 6, 12))
8. Node 10: (10, (1, 14, 19)), (10, (1, 14, 11)), (10, (11, 19, 10))
9. Node 11: (11, (7, 15, 19)), (11, (7, 15, 16))
10. Node 13: (13, (6, 18, 14))

By examining all nodes, we found all the unique 3-star patterns in the graph. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.

The number of unique 3-stars is 13. Thus, the final answer is [13].

<List of unique 3-stars>
<1, (2, 10, 19)>
<1, (2, 10, 12)>
<2, (1, 5, 17)>
<2, (1, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 8, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, 15, 12)>
<6, (8, 15, 13)>
<6, (8, 15, 7)>
<6, (8, 15, 6)>
