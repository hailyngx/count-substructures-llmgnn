Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it has exactly three neighbors, indicating a potential 3-star:

- Node 13 does not have any neighbors.
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, Node 14 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 19 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they can possibly be the center of a 3-star.

2. For each of the nodes found in step 1, check their neighbors to form 3-stars:

- From Node 0: (11, 19, 6) <0, (11, 19, 6)>
- From Node 1: (12, 16, 4), (12, 16, 9), (12, 4, 9) <1, (12, 16, 4)>, <1, (12, 16, 9)>, <1, (12, 4, 9)>
- From Node 3: (17, 19, 18), (17, 19, 9), (17, 18, 9) <3, (17, 19, 18)>, <3, (17, 19, 9)>, <3, (17, 18, 9)>
- From Node 6: (14, 17, 2), (14, 17, 6), (14, 17, 0) <6, (14, 17, 2)>, <6, (14, 17, 6)>, <6, (14, 17, 0)>
- From Node 7: (11, 12, 18) <7, (11, 12, 18)>
- From Node 9: (17, 3, 1), (17, 3, 9), (17, 1, 9) <9, (17, 3, 1)>, <9, (17, 3, 9)>, <9, (17, 1, 9)>
- From Node 11: (10, 7, 0), (10, 7, 4), (10, 0, 4) <11, (10, 7, 0)>, <11, (10, 7, 4)>, <11, (10, 0, 4)>
- From Node 12: (10, 7, 1) <12, (10, 7, 1)>
- From Node 16: (10, 5, 1) <16, (10, 5, 1)>
- From Node 17: (14, 6, 4), (14, 6, 9), (14, 4, 9) <17, (14, 6, 4)>, <17, (14, 6, 9)>, <17, (14, 4, 9)>
- From Node 19: (0, 18, 3) <19, (0, 18, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

<0, (11, 19, 6)>, <1, (12, 16, 4)>, <1, (12, 16, 9)>, <1, (12, 4, 9)>, <3, (17, 19, 18)>, <3, (17, 19, 9)>, <3, (17, 18, 9)>, <6, (14, 17, 2)>, <6, (14, 17, 6)>, <6, (14, 17, 0)>, <7, (11, 12, 18)>, <9, (17, 3, 1)>, <9, (17, 3, 9)>, <9, (17, 1, 9)>, <11, (10, 7, 0)>, <11, (10, 7, 4)>, <11, (10, 0, 4)>, <12, (10, 7, 1)>, <16, (10, 5, 1)>, <17, (14, 6, 4)>, <17, (14, 6, 9)>, <17, (14, 4, 9)>, <19, (0, 18, 3)>
