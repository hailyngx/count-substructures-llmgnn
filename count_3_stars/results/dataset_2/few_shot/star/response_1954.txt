Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 5 (possible 3-star with center 0) and node 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 5 (possible 3-star with center 1) and 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 5, 13 (possible 3-star with center 2) and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 12 (possible 3-star with center 3) and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 14 (possible 3-star with center 4) and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 1 (possible 3-star with center 5) and 11.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 10 (possible 3-star with center 6) and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 2 (possible 3-star with center 7) and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 14 (possible 3-star with center 8) and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3 (possible 3-star with center 9) and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 0 (possible 3-star with center 10) and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 2, 5, 1 (possible 3-star with center 11).
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 3 (possible 3-star with center 12) and 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 2 (possible 3-star with center 13) and 4.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8 (possible 3-star with center 14) and 4.

Let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (10, 11, 5)>
- <1, (7, 5, 11)>
- <2, (7, 12, 5)>
- <3, (6, 9, 12)>
- <4, (9, 14, 13)>
- <5, (0, 2, 1)>
- <6, (7, 10, 13)>
- <7, (6, 12, 2)>
- <8, (12, 0, 14)>
- <9, (4, 3, 13)>
- <10, (6, 0, 8)>
- <11, (6, 0, 5)>
- <12, (7, 2, 8)>
- <13, (6, 9, 4)>
- <14, (8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
