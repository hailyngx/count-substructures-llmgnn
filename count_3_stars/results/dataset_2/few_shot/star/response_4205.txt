Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph structure. 

1. From the adjacency list provided, we can see the connections for each node.
2. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.
3. We will then list all the unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (9, 7, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, -)>
<3, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
