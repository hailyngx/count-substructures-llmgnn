Response:
Starting from each node as the center of the 3-star, we find the following unique 3-stars: 
<4, (7, 1, 27)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<14, (17, 19, 8)>
<20, (25, 18, 27)>
<21, (28, 6, 26)>
<1, (3, 4, 11)>
<3, (11, 1, 24)>
<28, (13, 21, 26)>
<13, (25, 28, 26)>
<11, (12, 19, 3)>
<27, (5, 4, 29)>
<0, (22, 16, 27)>
<9, (12, 23, 29)>
<6, (8, 21, 23)>
<18, (19, 20, 27)>
<25, (15, 12, 20)>
<17, (8, 14, 19)>
<26, (24, 21, 13)>
<10, (2, 15, 16)>
<16, (0, 10, 22)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
