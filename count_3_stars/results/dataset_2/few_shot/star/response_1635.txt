Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (7, 1, 3)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<0, (7, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 0, 5)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<1, (5, 0, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 6)>
<2, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (8, 4, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
