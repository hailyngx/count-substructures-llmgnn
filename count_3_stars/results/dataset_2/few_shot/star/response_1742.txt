Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

The total number of 3-stars can be counted by finding all the possible combinations of nodes where each node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars that can be found in the graph:
<0, (12, 5, 13)>
<1, (8, 11, 13)>
<2, (4, 7, 10)>
<3, (4, 6, 12)>
<4, (5, 14, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (14, 2, 7)>
<8, (9, 5, 11)>
<9, (14, 4, 12)>
<10, (9, 2, 3)>
<11, (9, 1, 8)>
<12, (4, 2, 13)>
<13, (12, 0, 14)>
<14, (4, 9, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
