Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 10, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 10, 1, 5, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 10, 11, 0, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 11, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 14, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 7, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 3, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, 8, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 11, 3, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star subgraphs in this graph:

1. <0, (9, 10, 8)>
2. <2, (6, 10, 14)>
3. <3, (7, 11, 13)>
4. <4, (7, 5, 1)>
5. <5, (4, 7, 2)>
6. <6, (2, 8, 13)>
7. <7, (9, 4, 5)>
8. <8, (6, 14, 0)>
9. <9, (11, 7, 0)>
10. <10, (0, 3, 12)>
11. <11, (9, 7, 13)>
12. <12, (9, 10, 8)>
13. <13, (6, 11, 3)>
14. <14, (8, 2)>

15 3-stars are identified, so the final answer is [15].
