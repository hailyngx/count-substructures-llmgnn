Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For Node 5:
- <5, (9, 12, 1)>

2. For Node 9:
- <9, (5, 15, 17)>
- <9, (5, 17, 16)>

3. For Node 4:
- <4, (7, 17, 2)>

4. For Node 7:
- <7, (4, 12, 16)>

5. For Node 12:
- <12, (5, 7, 0)>
- <12, (5, 7, 11)>

6. For Node 13:
- <13, (8, 16, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
