Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars:

<3, (15, 20, 8)>
<15, (3, 19, 8)>
<17, (29, 0, 26)>
<20, (3, 25, 23)>
<25, (0, 12, 28)>
<26, (17, 18, 11)>
<2, (23, 27, not connected)>
<5, (18, 8, 11)>
<18, (26, 5, 10)>
<1, (6, 11, 13)>

So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [10].
