Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (8, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
