Node 19 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<2, (8, 16, 9)>
<5, (3, 11, 19)>
<7, (3, 15, 19)>
<8, (2, 9, 15)>
<9, (8, 17, 18)>
<11, (1, 12, 18)>
<12, (1, 11, 17)>
<13, (8, 17, *)>
<15, (3, 8, 17)>
<17, (0, 12, 15)>
<18, (9, 11, 14)>
<19, (5, 7, *)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
