Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 11, 12, and node 5

Node 2 is connected to node 13, 5, 7, 12, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 13, 6, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 14, 12, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 14, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 10, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 13, 0, 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 13, 4, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 14, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 0, and node 9

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (7, 11, 12)>
<0, (5, 12, 7)>
<1, (7, 4, 6)>
<1, (10, 6, 3)>
<2, (13, 5, 7)>
<2, (12, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 13, 6)>
<3, (10, 6, 1)>
<4, (14, 12, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 10)>
<5, (0, 14, 2)>
<5, (7, 2, 5)>
<6, (7, 1, 10)>
<7, (13, 0, 5)>
<8, (13, 9, 3)>
<9, (13, 4, 11)>
<10, (14, 1, 6)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we get a total of [17].
