Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
