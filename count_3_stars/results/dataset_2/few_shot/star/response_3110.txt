Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2)

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node and its connections. 

- Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 10)>  (node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 10)
- Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 4)>  (node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4)
- Node 2: <2, (7, 3, 12)>  (node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 12)
- Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 10)>  (node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 10)
- Node 4: <4, (8, 0, 1)>  (node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 1)
- Node 5: <5, (12, 1, 7)>  (node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 1, and 7)
- Node 6: Not part of any 3-star
- Node 7: <7, (5, 11, 2)> and <7, (3, 14, 2)>  (node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 2, and also to nodes 3, 14, and 2)
- Node 8: <8, (4, 10, 13)>  (node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 13)
- Node 9: <9, (11, 14, 1)>  (node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 1)
- Node 10: <10, (0, 3, 8)>  (node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8)
- Node 11: <11, (9, 7, 3)>  (node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 3)
- Node 12: <12, (5, 2)>  (node 12 is connected to nodes 5 and 2)
- Node 13: Not part of any 3-star
- Node 14: <14, (9, 7, 10)>  (node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 10)

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 11 unique 3-stars. So, the final answer is [11].
