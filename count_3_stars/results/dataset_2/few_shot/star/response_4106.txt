Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that create a 3-star pattern. These are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- <1, (0, 19, 3)>
- <3, (1, 10, 19)>
- <4, (0, 11, 15)>
- <5, (16, 17, 19)>
- <6, (13, 7, 2)>
- <7, (17, 6, 5)>
- <8, (11, 13, 10)>
- <9, (3, 2, 9)>
- <11, (16, 18, 8)>
- <14, (17, 18, 12)>
- <15, (17, 4, 18)>
- <16, (11, 19, 5)>
- <17, (14, 15, 7)>
- <18, (11, 13, 15)>
- <19, (16, 1, 3)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
