Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Based on the adjacency information provided, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (15, 27, 28)>
<1, (26, 20, 17)>
<2, (3, 11, 0)>
<3, (2, 8, 15)>
<4, (7, 18, 25)>
<5, (7, 23, 12)>
<6, (9, 24, 14)>
<7, (4, 16, 5)>
<8, (9, 3, 15)>
<9, (6, 14, 13)>
<10, (17, 21, 14)>
<11, (8, 2, 19)>
<12, (15, 5, 29)>
<13, (9, 28, 0)>
<14, (9, 6, 23)>
<15, (8, 12, 0)>
<16, (7, 28, 19)>
<17, (10, 1, 21)>
<18, (4, 25, 21)>
<19, (11, 28, 0)>
<20, (25, 1, 24)>
<21, (25, 10, 18)>
<22, (27, 29, 0)>
<23, (5, 14, 29)>
<24, (20, 6, 27)>
<25, (4, 20, 21)>
<26, (1, 17, 0)>
<27, (0, 22, 24)>
<28, (0, 16, 19)>
<29, (23, 18, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
