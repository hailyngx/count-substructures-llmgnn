Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 7, 14, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 13, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 5, and node 11

Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, 11, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 4, 0, 14, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 13, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 10, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 5, 12, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 0, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, 11, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 7, 5, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. For a 3-star, we look for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can find the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 13, 4)>
<2, (13, 5, 11)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<4, (1, 7, 10)>
<5, (7, 2, 11)>
<6, (9, 3, -)>
<7, (8, 4, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<9, (1, 10, 3)>
<10, (9, 3, 4)>
<11, (13, 5, 12)>
<12, (0, 10, 11)>
<13, (1, 8, 2)>
<14, (13, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
