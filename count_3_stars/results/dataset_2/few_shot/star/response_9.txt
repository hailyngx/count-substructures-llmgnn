Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (5, 8, 7)>
2. <1, (6, 4, 3)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 4)>
4. <3, (6, 1, 0)>
5. <4, (9, 6, 8)>
6. <5, (9, 2, 7)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 9, 0)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 0)>

Count the number of 3-stars found: [9]
