Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:
- For Node 0: (0, 5, 9), (0, 5, 3)
- For Node 1: (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 2), (1, 7, 6), (1, 7, 2), (1, 6, 2)
- For Node 2: (2, 5, 4), (2, 5, 8), (2, 5, 6), (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6), (2, 8, 6)
- For Node 3: (3, 7, 8), (3, 7, 6), (3, 7, 0), (3, 8, 6), (3, 8, 0), (3, 6, 0)
- For Node 4: (4, 8, 2), (4, 8, 6), (4, 1, 7)
- For Node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 2), (5, 6, 2)
- For Node 6: (6, 8, 1), (6, 8, 3), (6, 8, 2), (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 2), (6, 3, 2)
- For Node 7: (7, 9, 3), (7, 9, 1), (7, 3, 1)
- For Node 8: (8, 9, 4), (8, 9, 2), (8, 9, 6), (8, 4, 2), (8, 4, 6), (8, 2, 6)
- For Node 9: (9, 8, 4), (9, 8, 2), (9, 8, 6), (9, 4, 2), (9, 4, 6), (9, 2, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 27. 

So, the final answer is [27].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (8, 2, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 6)>
<6, (8, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 3, 7)>
