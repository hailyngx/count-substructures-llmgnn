Response:
From the given graph information, the central nodes and their adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Central nodes with 3 adjacent nodes: 9, 27, 28, 22, 8, 11, 13, 15, 4
- Central nodes with more/less than 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29
  
Now, let's identify the 3-stars (complete stars) in the graph:
- There are no 3-stars in this graph, since none of the central nodes have exactly 3 adjacent nodes.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
