Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 0

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: Forms 3-stars with (8, 6, 5), (8, 9, 0), (6, 4, 0) - Total: 3
2. Node 1: Forms 3-stars with (8, 4, 1) - Total: 1
3. Node 2: Forms 3-stars with (8, 4, 2), (8, 3, 2), (8, 6, 2) - Total: 3
4. Node 3: Forms 3-stars with (2, 7, 3), (2, 1, 3), (2, 5, 3) - Total: 3
5. Node 4: Forms 3-stars with (2, 8, 4), (2, 7, 4), (2, 1, 4) - Total: 3
6. Node 5: Forms 3-stars with (0, 7, 5), (0, 3, 5), (0, 9, 5) - Total: 3
7. Node 6: Forms 3-stars with (2, 8, 6), (2, 7, 6), (2, 0, 6) - Total: 3
8. Node 7: Forms 3-stars with (8, 2, 7), (8, 6, 7), (8, 5, 7) - Total: 3
9. Node 8: Forms 3-stars with (7, 6, 8), (7, 2, 8), (7, 1, 8), (7, 0, 8) - Total: 4
10. Node 9: Forms 3-stars with (4, 6, 9), (4, 1, 9) - Total: 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
