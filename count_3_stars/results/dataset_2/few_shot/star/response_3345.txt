Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Now, let's go through each node and determine if they are part of any 3-star patterns:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 5, and 2. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8. It is part of a 3-star pattern with nodes 3, 5, and 8. 
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 5, and 0. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 2, and 4. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 7, and 8. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 8, 2, and 0. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 0. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, and 8. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 5. It is part of a 3-star pattern with nodes 1, 4, and 7. 
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, 7, and 0. It is not part of any 3-star pattern.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>
