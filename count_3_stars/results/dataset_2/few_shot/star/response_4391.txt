Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that has exactly 3 edges and count the number of 3-stars based on those nodes.

The nodes that have exactly 3 edges are: nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.

1. For node 0: There exists one 3-star centered at node 0, which is <0, (7, 8, 6)>.
2. For node 2: There exists one 3-star centered at node 2, which is <2, (5, 6, 0)>.
3. For node 3: There are no 3-stars centered at node 3.
4. For node 4: There are no 3-stars centered at node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
