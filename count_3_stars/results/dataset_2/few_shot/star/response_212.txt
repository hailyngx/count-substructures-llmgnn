Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, we need to look for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 12, 13)>
<1, (3, 10, 18)>
<2, (15, 8, 14)>
<4, (5, 14, 17)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (11, 8, 19)>
<7, (16, 5, 1)>
<8, (2, 17, 6)>
<10, (1, 19, 13)>
<11, (6, 12, X)> (One edge missing)
<12, (11, 0, X)> (One edge missing)
<13, (0, 18, 10)>
<14, (2, 4, X)> (One edge missing)
<15, (16, 2, X)> (One edge missing)
<16, (7, 15, X)> (One edge missing)
<17, (5, 8, 18)>
<18, (9, 1, 19)>
<19, (18, 10, 6)>

As we can see, there are 18 unique 3-stars listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
