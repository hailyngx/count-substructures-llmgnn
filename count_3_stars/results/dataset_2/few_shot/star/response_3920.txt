Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 2, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) -> <1, (3, 6, 2)>
2. Node 3: (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) -> <3, (1, 6, 9)>
3. Node 4: (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) -> <4, (1, 8, 5)>
4. Node 8: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) -> <8, (4, 2, 9)>
5. Node 0: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) -> <0, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
