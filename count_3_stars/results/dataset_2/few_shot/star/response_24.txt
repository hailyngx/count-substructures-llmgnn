Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list, we will find the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 12. <0, (6, 13, 12)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 11, and 8. <1, (6, 11, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 7. <2, (8, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 12. <3, (5, 9, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 8. <4, (5, 11, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 10, and 4. <5, (3, 10, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 0. <6, (1, 7, 0)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 13, and 2. <7, (1, 13, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 2. <8, (13, 4, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 14, and 3. <9, (6, 14, 3)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 14. <10, (5, 11, 14)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 1, and 12. <11, (10, 1, 12)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 0. <12, (9, 11, 0)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 14, and 7. <13, (8, 14, 7)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 13. <14, (9, 10, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
