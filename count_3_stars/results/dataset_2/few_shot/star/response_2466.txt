Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (4, 8, 9)
2. Node 9: (5, 7, 8)
3. Node 4: (0, 3, 5)
4. Node 7: (1, 2, 9)
5. Node 1: (3, 8, 2)
6. Node 3: (0, 1, 5)
7. Node 0: (3, 4, 9)
8. Node 6: (2, 4, 7)
9. Node 8: (1, 5, 9)
10. Node 2: (1, 6, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
The unique 3-stars are <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>.
