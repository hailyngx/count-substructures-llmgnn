Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given adjacency list:

<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [7].
