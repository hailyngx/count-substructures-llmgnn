Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars present. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the central node of a 3-star can be any node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the central nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 27, 3, and 23.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 25, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: 18, 1, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 14, 15, and 25.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 7 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 23, 24, and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 22, 4, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 11 is connected to 3 other nodes: 24, 27, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 13 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 1, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to 3 other nodes: 19, 25, and 5.
- Node 15 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 16 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 17 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 18, and 15.
- Node 18 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 17, and 29.
- Node 19 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 20 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 21 is connected to 2 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 22 is connected to 3 other nodes: 23, 26, and 12.
- Node 23 is connected to 5 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 24 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 11, and 12.
- Node 25 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 26 is connected to 3 other nodes: 21, 22, and 10.
- Node 27 is connected to 4 other nodes, so it cannot be a central node.
- Node 28 is connected to 3 other nodes: 7, 15, and 25.
- Node 29 is connected to 3 other nodes: 23, 18, and 12.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (27, 3, 23)>
<1, (2, 25, 13)>
<5, (14, 15, 25)>
<8, (23, 24, 17)>
<9, (22, 4, 19)>
<11, (24, 27, 12)>
<17, (8, 18, 15)>
<18, (2, 17, 29)>
<26, (21, 22, 10)>
<28, (7, 15, 25)>
<29, (23, 18, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
