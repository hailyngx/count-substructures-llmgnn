Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and its three directly connected nodes. However, we have 10 nodes in the graph and without any constraints on the nodes, determining all 3-star combinations manually may be cumbersome. 

One approach to simplify this is to recognize that in a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can search for each node in the graph, check if it has exactly three neighbors, and then consider all unique 3-stars that can be formed around that central node. 

Given this rationale, let's proceed with identifying the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
