Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 4, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 12, 5, 1, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 3, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 8, 13, 1, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 13, 12, 0, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 9, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 9, 14, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 13, 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors.
- Identify nodes with three neighbors: Nodes 6 and 10.

Step 2: For each identified node from Step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.
Checking node 6: Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it has only two neighbors.

Checking node 10: Node 10 forms a 3-star.
- <10, (0, 7, 10)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.
- Total number of 3-stars: 1
