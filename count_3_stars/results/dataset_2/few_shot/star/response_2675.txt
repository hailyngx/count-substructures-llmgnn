Response:
The graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through each node to find any 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars.
- Node 1: No 3-stars.
- Node 2: No 3-stars.
- Node 3: No 3-stars.
- Node 4: <4, (0, 13, 19)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars.
- Node 6: No 3-stars.
- Node 7: No 3-stars.
- Node 8: <8, (6, 11, 15)>
- Node 9: No 3-stars.
- Node 10: <10, (6, 15, 5)>
- Node 11: <11, (8, 9, 14)>
- Node 12: No 3-stars.
- Node 13: No 3-stars.
- Node 14: No 3-stars.
- Node 15: No 3-stars.
- Node 16: No 3-stars.
- Node 17: No 3-stars.
- Node 18: No 3-stars.
- Node 19: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<4, (0, 13, 19)>, <8, (6, 11, 15)>, <10, (6, 15, 5)>, and <11, (8, 9, 14)>.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
