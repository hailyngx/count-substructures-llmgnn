Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 8, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

<5, (6, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 0, 1)>
<0, (6, 7, 4)>
<9, (2, 8, 7)>
