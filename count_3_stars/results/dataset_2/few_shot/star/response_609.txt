Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
