Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 18, and 23
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 28, and 9
   - Node 23 is connected to nodes 28 and 1

2. For each identified node, form a 3-star configuration with that node as the center and the 3 connected nodes as the leaves:
   - <1, (10, 18, 23)>
   - <8, (17, 28, 9)>
   - <23, (28, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
