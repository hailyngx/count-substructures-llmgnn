Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a star pattern). 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (11, 10, 17)>
<1, (16, 5, 11)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (18, 9, 10)>
<8, (19, 7, 8)>
<12, (13, 15, 3)>
<13, (17, 19, 12)>
<14, (16, 19, 11)>
<15, (16, 12, 15)>
<16, (14, 1, 11)>
<18, (19, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
