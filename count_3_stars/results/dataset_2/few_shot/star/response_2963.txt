Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 12 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 12, 2, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
   From the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the potential central nodes of 3-stars as follows:
   - Node 4 has connections with 7, 8, and 6
   - Node 7 has connections with 12, 11, and 6
   - Node 1 has connections with 3, 2, and 9
   - Node 3 has connections with 1, 2, and 5
   - Node 8 has connections with 13, 14, and 12
   - Node 6 has connections with 9, 10, and 11
   - Node 0 has connections with 13, 9, and 14

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (12, 11, 6)>
<1, (3, 2, 9)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.]
