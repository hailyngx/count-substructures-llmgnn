Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves). These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.
These nodes are: 13, 22, 24, 4, 15, 16, and 3.

Step 2: For each of these center nodes, find the neighbors (leaves) connected to it to form a 3-star.
Let's find and list the 3-stars:

<13, (22, 4, 24)>
<22, (13, 26, 9)>
<24, (13, 7, 14)>
<4, (13, 19, 14)>
<15, (23, 26, 16)>
<16, (28, 15, 18)>
<3, (26, 7, 15)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
