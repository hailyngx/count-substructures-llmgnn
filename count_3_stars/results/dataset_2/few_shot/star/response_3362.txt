Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph step by step:

1. Find all nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 21, 29, and 13.
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 9, 7, and 24.
   - Node 2 has neighbors: 29 and 16.
   - Node 4 has neighbors: 26, 10, and 24.
   - Node 9 has neighbors: 26, 28, and 1.
   - Node 12 has neighbors: 28, 6, and 3.
   - Node 13 has neighbors: 26, 11, and 0.
   - Node 16 has neighbors: 21, 25, and 8.
   - Node 19 has neighbors: 20, 5, and 3.
   - Node 25 has neighbors: 20, 16, and 28.
   - Node 28 has neighbors: 9, 25, and 0.
   - Node 29 has neighbors: 2, 6, and 0.

2. Identify the 3-star graphs:
   - <0, (21, 29, 13)>
   - <1, (9, 7, 24)>
   - <2, (29, 16, -)>
   - <4, (26, 10, 24)>
   - <9, (26, 28, 1)>
   - <12, (28, 6, 3)>
   - <13, (26, 11, 0)>
   - <16, (21, 25, 8)>
   - <19, (20, 5, 3)>
   - <25, (20, 16, 28)>
   - <28, (9, 25, 0)>
   - <29, (2, 6, 0)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [12]
