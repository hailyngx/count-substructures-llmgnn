Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Step 1: Identify the central node candidates.
- Look for nodes with degree exactly 3, as these could potentially be central nodes in 3-stars.

Central node candidates: 11, 13, 4, 16

Step 2: For each central node candidate identified in Step 1, check if it is indeed the center of a 3-star by checking its neighbors if they form leaves.

For central node 11:
- (11, 16), (11, 13) -> <11, (16, 13)>
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For central node 13:
- (13, 11), (13, 7) -> <13, (11, 7)>
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For central node 4:
- (4, 12), (4, 6) -> <4, (12, 6)>
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For central node 16:
- (16, 11), (16, 12) -> <16, (11, 12)>
- Number of 3-stars: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
