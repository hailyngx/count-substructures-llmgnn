Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: 
  - No 3-stars have Node 0 as the center.

- For Node 1: 
  - <1, (13, 7, 4)>
  - <1, (13, 8, 2)>
  - <1, (7, 10, 4)>
  - <1, (4, 14, 8)>

- For Node 2: 
  - <2, (5, 10, 11)>
  - <2, (5, 11, 12)>
  - <2, (5, 13, 12)>
  - <2, (5, 10, 13)>
  - <2, (11, 6, 5)>

- For Node 3: 
  - <3, (9, 0, 4)>
  - <3, (9, 8, 10)>
  - <3, (9, 10, 4)>
  - <3, (8, 6, 12)>

- For Node 4: 
  - <4, (14, 11, 12)>
  - <4, (14, 12, 8)>
  - <4, (14, 3, 10)>
  - <4, (14, 10, 1)>

- For Node 5:
  - No 3-stars have Node 5 as the center.

- For Node 6: 
  - <6, (9, 11, 12)>
  - <6, (9, 7, 11)>
  - <6, (9, 8, 12)>
  - <6, (11, 5, 14)>

- For Node 7:
  - No 3-stars have Node 7 as the center.

- For Node 8: 
  - <8, (6, 12, 14)>
  - <8, (6, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (6, 4, 12)>
  - <8, (14, 4, 13)>

- For Node 9:
  - No 3-stars have Node 9 as the center.

- For Node 10: 
  - <10, (5, 7, 3)>
  - <10, (5, 3, 2)>
  - <10, (5, 2, 12)>
  - <10, (5, 2, 11)>

- For Node 11: 
  - <11, (6, 5, 14)>
  - <11, (6, 14, 12)>
  - <11, (6, 5, 2)>
  - <11, (6, 2, 12)>

- For Node 12: 
  - <12, (8, 4, 14)>
  - <12, (8, 4, 2)>
  - <12, (8, 6, 14)>
  - <12, (8, 6, 4)>

- For Node 13: 
  - No 3-stars have Node 13 as the center.

- For Node 14: 
  - <14, (4, 11, 12)>
  - <14, (4, 11, 13)>
  - <14, (4, 8, 13)>
  - <14, (8, 6, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are:
<1, (13, 7, 4)>
<1, (13, 8, 2)>
<1, (7, 10, 4)>
<1, (4, 14, 8)>
<2, (5, 10, 11)>
<2, (5, 11, 12)>
<2, (5, 13, 12)>
<2, (5, 10, 13)>
<2, (11, 6, 5)>
<3, (9, 0, 4)>
<3, (9, 8, 10)>
<3, (9, 10, 4)>
<3, (8, 6, 12)>
<4, (14, 11, 12)>
<4, (14, 12, 8)>
<4, (14, 3, 10)>
<4, (14, 10, 1)>
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<6, (9, 7, 11)>
<6, (9, 8, 12)>
<6, (11, 5, 14)>
<8, (6, 12, 14)>

<10, (5, 7, 3)>
<10, (5, 3, 2)>
<10, (5, 2, 12)>
<10, (5, 2, 11)>
<11, (6, 5, 14)>
<11, (6, 14, 12)>
<11, (6, 5, 2)>
<11, (6, 2, 12)>
<12, (8, 4, 14)>
<12, (8, 4, 2)>
<12, (8, 6, 14)>
<12, (8, 6, 4)>
<14, (4, 11, 12)>
<14, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (4, 8, 13)>
