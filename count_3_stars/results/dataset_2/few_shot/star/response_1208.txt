Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (10, 2, 7), (10, 5, 8)
2. Node 1: (3, 14, 13), (3, 4, 7)
3. Node 2: (10, 0, 8)
4. Node 3: (1, 5, 8)
5. Node 5: (3, 11, 12), (0, 8, 5), (3, 5, 7)
6. Node 6: (9, 7, 12)
7. Node 7: (1, 9, 5), (0, 7, 5)
8. Node 8: (3, 5, 12), (0, 2, 12)
9. Node 9: (6, 4, 13), (6, 7, 12)
10. Node 10: (1, 11, 2), (1, 0, 8)
11. Node 12: (6, 11, 14)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (10, 2, 7)>, <0, (10, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 14, 13)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (10, 0, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 12)>, <7, (1, 9, 5)>, <7, (0, 7, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 12)>, <8, (0, 2, 12)>, <9, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 7, 12)>, <10, (1, 11, 2)>, <10, (1, 0, 8)>, <12, (6, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
