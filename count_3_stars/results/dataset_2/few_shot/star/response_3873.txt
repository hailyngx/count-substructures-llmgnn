Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. Then, for each central node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 7, 11)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 12, 1)>
<7, (5, 12, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<8, (9, 7, 13)>
<13, (8, 12, 3)>
<12, (4, 7, 11)>
<0, (14, 3, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 10)>
<2, (12, 3, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
