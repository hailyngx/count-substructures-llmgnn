Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

- From the adjacency list, we see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8. Let's check each of these central nodes:

1. For node 1:
    - 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    
2. For node 4:
    - 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 8)>

3. For node 5:
    - 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
    
4. For node 8:
    - 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are total [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
