Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 11, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 13, 14, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 12, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 12, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 12, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 13, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 12, 7, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 13, 1, and node 8

Response:
Following the properties of the 3-star graph, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, 1: <0, (9, 11, 1)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, 2: <4, (9, 6, 2)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, 8: <7, (9, 10, 8)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 12, 14: <8, (5, 12, 14)>
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 12, 7: <10, (11, 12, 7)>
6. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 1: <13, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
