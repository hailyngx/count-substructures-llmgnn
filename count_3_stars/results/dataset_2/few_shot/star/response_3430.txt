Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the other two nodes are not connected directly. These sets will represent the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors since in a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14, and 19 have exactly three neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, find pairs of their neighbors that are not directly connected.
   - For Node 0: (10, 15), (10, 11), (15, 11)
   - For Node 1: (4, 6), (4, 14), (6, 14)
   - For Node 2: (3, 10), (3, 14), (10, 14)
   - For Node 4: (1, 6), (1, 14), (6, 14)
   - For Node 5: (13, 19), (13, 0), (19, 0)
   - For Node 6: (13, 4), (13, 1), (4, 1)
   - For Node 10: (16, 0), (16, 14), (0, 14)
   - For Node 14: (3, 10), (3, 1), (10, 1)
   - For Node 19: (12, 5), (12, 18), (5, 18)

3. Form unique 3-stars considering the center node and the pairs of nodes that are not directly connected.
   - <0, (10, 15, 11)> is a 3-star
   - <1, (4, 6, 14)> is a 3-star
   - <2, (3, 10, 14)> is a 3-star
   - <4, (1, 6, 14)> is a 3-star
   - <5, (13, 19, 0)> is a 3-star
   - <6, (13, 4, 1)> is a 3-star
   - <10, (16, 0, 14)> is a 3-star
   - <14, (3, 10, 1)> is a 3-star
   - <19, (12, 5, 18)> is a 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [9]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (10, 15, 11)>
<1, (4, 6, 14)>
<2, (3, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 6, 14)>
<5, (13, 19, 0)>
<6, (13, 4, 1)>
<10, (16, 0, 14)>
<14, (3, 10, 1)>
<19, (12, 5, 18)>
