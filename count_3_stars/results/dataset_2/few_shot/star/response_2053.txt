Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (17, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 0, 13)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 12, 0)>
<5, (1, 14)>
<6, (7, 16, 18)>
<7, (12, 11, 6)>
<8, (3, 19)>
<9, (3, 17, 19)>
<10, (16, 2)>
<11, (7, 19, 4)>
<12, (7, 16, 18)>
<13, (4, 2)>
<14, (5)>
<15, (2, 17)>
<16, (12, 19, 6)>
<17, (0, 9, 15)>
<18, (12, 6)>
<19, (8, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
