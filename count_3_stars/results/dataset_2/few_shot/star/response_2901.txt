Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars. Let's start by looking at each node's connections.

From the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (10, 13)>
<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<2, (7, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 11, 14)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<5, (1, 6, 14)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 11, 6)>
<8, (14, 9, 12)>
<9, (11, 8, 10)>
<10, (0, 13, 14)>
<11, (7, 3, 6)>
<12, (4, 6, 8)>
<13, (4, 3, 5)>
<14, (4, 3, 5)>

To find the total number of unique 3-stars, we count the unique triples identified above. 
In this case, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
