Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find all 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
