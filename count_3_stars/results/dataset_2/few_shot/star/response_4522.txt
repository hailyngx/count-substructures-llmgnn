Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Given the graph, the 3-stars can be identified by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, n/a)>
<7, (6, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we get a total of [10].
