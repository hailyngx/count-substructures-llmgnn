Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be any of the 15 nodes in the graph. We will go through each node and check its connections to find the 3-stars.

For Node 0:
- Possible 3-star: <0, (12, 10, 3)>
- Possible 3-star: <0, (12, 1, 13)>
- Possible 3-star: <0, (10, 1, 14)>

For Node 1:
- Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 10, 14)>

For Node 2:
- Possible 3-star: <2, (6, 5, 13)>
- Possible 3-star: <2, (6, 11, 2)>

For Node 3:
- Possible 3-star: <3, (6, 12, 0)>
- Possible 3-star: <3, (6, 10, 5)>

For Node 4:
- Possible 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 12)>
- Possible 3-star: <4, (9, 8, 11)>

For Node 5:
- Possible 3-star: <5, (7, 3, 2)>

For Node 6:
- Possible 3-star: <6, (9, 3, 12)>
- Possible 3-star: <6, (9, 2, 13)>

For Node 7: <7, (4, 12, 5)>

For Node 8: No 3-star possible.

For Node 9:
- Possible 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 11)>
- Possible 3-star: <9, (6, 11, 13)>
- Possible 3-star: <9, (6, 13, 14)>

For Node 10: No 3-star possible.

For Node 11: No 3-star possible.

For Node 12: No 3-star possible.

For Node 13: No 3-star possible.

For Node 14: No 3-star possible.

Therefore, there are <0, (12, 10, 3)>, <0, (12, 1, 13)>, <0, (10, 1, 14)>, <1, (0, 10, 14)>, <2, (6, 5, 13)>, <2, (6, 11, 2)>, <3, (6, 12, 0)>, <3, (6, 10, 5)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <4, (9, 8, 11)>, <5, (7, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 12)>, <6, (9, 2, 13)>, <7, (4, 12, 5)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
