Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.  

Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph as follows:

<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 11, 0)>
<4, (7, 13, 10)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<10, (4, 8, -)>
<11, (6, 7, 14)>
<1, (5, 3, 12)>
<3, (5, 1, 13)>
<8, (10, 1, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 11)>
<12, (5, 1, 0)>
<14, (9, 11, 13)>
<13, (4, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
