Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. In the given graph, the central node of a 3-star can't be nodes 6, 11, 12, 14, 17 as these nodes either have less than 3 connections or are connected to nodes that do not form a 3-star configuration.

2. Let's go through each node and check if they are the center of a 3-star:
   - For node 0: <0, (11, 4, 18)> and <0, (11, 4, 18)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 1: <1, (3, 5, 18)> is a 3-star.
   - For node 2: <2, (15, 13, 4)> and <2, (15, 13, 5)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 3: <3, (1, 10, 19)> is a 3-star.
   - For node 4: <4, (8, 7, 0)> and <4, (8, 7, 2)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 5: <5, (15, 1, 13)> is a 3-star.
   - For node 7: No 3-stars centered at node 7.
   - For node 8: <8, (1, 13, 4)> and <8, (1, 13, 18)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 9: No 3-stars centered at node 9.
   - For node 10: <10, (16, 3, 13)> and <10, (16, 3, 7)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 13: <13, (8, 5, 2)> and <13, (8, 5, 18)> are two 3-stars.
   - For node 15: <15, (16, 5, 2)> is a 3-star.
   - For node 16: No 3-stars centered at node 16.
   - For node 18: No 3-stars centered at node 18.
   - For node 19: No 3-stars centered at node 19.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 4, 18)>
<1, (3, 5, 18)>
<2, (15, 13, 4)>
<2, (15, 13, 5)>
<4, (8, 7, 0)>
<4, (8, 7, 2)>
<5, (15, 1, 13)>
<8, (1, 13, 4)>
<8, (1, 13, 18)>
<10, (16, 3, 13)>
