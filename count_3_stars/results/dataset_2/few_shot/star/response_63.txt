Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3)

Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's follow the steps below to find and count all such 3-stars:

1. Examine each node in the graph.
2. Identify if the node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. If a node satisfies the condition, record the 3-star structure with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.
4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<1, (9, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 8, -)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 3, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (6, 2, 5)>
<9, (7, 6, 1)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [10]
