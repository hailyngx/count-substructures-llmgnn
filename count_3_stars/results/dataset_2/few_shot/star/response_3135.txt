Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<8, (13, 10, 18)>
<13, (16, 8, 1)>
<10, (8, 13, 0)>
<7, (16, 12, 3)>
<2, (5, 19, 15)>
<6, (7, 12, 15)>
<18, (8, 15, 14)>
<5, (16, 2, 10)>
<12, (7, 14, 6)>
<9, (11, 0, 3)>

Counting the above unique 3-stars gives us a total of [10].
