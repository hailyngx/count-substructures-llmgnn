Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
