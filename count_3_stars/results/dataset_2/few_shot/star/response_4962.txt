Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this given graph, we need to look for nodes that are at the center of a 3-star. 

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with three connections (since a 3-star has exactly three edges connected to the center). These nodes could potentially be at the center of a 3-star. The nodes with three connections are: 6, 16, and 23.

2. For each of these potential center nodes, we need to check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Let's check:

- Node 6: Node 6 is connected only to node 18, hence it cannot be at the center of a 3-star.
- Node 16: Node 16 is connected only to node 29, hence it also cannot be at the center of a 3-star.
- Node 23: Node 23 is connected to node 24, which already has two connections. Therefore, node 23 also cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Since none of the potential center nodes satisfy the condition of being connected to exactly three other nodes, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the output is: [0].
