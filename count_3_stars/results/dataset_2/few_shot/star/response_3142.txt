Response:
Here is the step-by-step solution to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 13 is connected to 22, 16, 28, 9, 23
   - Node 22 is connected to 13, 2, 4, 21
   - Node 10 is connected to 11, 0, 7
   - Node 11 is connected to 10, 12, 17
   - Node 7 is connected to 10, 28, 15, 23
   - Node 9 is connected to 13, 10, 8, 20

2. Count the number of 3-stars centered around each of these nodes:
   - For Node 13: 3 combinations possible with nodes (22, 16, 28), (22, 16, 9), and (22, 28, 9)
   - For Node 22: 1 combination possible with nodes (13, 4, 21)
   - For Node 10: 0 combinations possible since all connected nodes have degrees greater than 3
   - For Node 11: 0 combinations possible since all connected nodes have degrees greater than 3
   - For Node 7: 1 combination possible with nodes (10, 28, 15)
   - For Node 9: 0 combinations possible since all connected nodes have degrees greater than 3

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars: 
   - <13, (22, 16, 28)> - 1
   - <13, (22, 16, 9)> - 1
   - <13, (22, 28, 9)> - 1
   - <22, (13, 4, 21)> - 1
   - <7, (10, 28, 15)> - 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
