Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and edge information provided, we can see that the center node must have exactly three neighbors in a 3-star. Let's identify all such 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. Node 4 in 3-star with (16, 15, 10)
2. Node 15 in 3-star with (8, 17, 4)
3. Node 8 in 3-star with (18, 15, 2)
4. Node 18 in 3-star with (13, 9, 8)
5. Node 13 in 3-star with (14, 12, 18)

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.  
The unique 3-stars found are as follows: 
<4, (16, 15, 10)>
<15, (8, 17, 4)>
<8, (18, 15, 2)>
<18, (13, 9, 8)>
<13, (14, 12, 18)>
So, the final answer is [5].
