Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 1

Response:
First, let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<0, (6, 2, 1)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<3, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [13].
