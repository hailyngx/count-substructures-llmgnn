Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<4, (22, 27, 19)>
<5, (27, 19, 10)>
<10, (15, 16, 14)>
<13, (29, 20, 22)>
<14, (26, 11, 10)>
<16, (26, 3, 10)>
<17, (22, 20, 19)>
<20, (13, 25, 22)>
<21, (2, 4, 23)>
<22, (4, 20, 17)>
<23, (21, 1, 24)>
<24, (25, 8, 23)>
<25, (29, 1, 24)>
