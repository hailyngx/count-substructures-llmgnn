Response:
We can start counting the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node and its neighbors.  
Let's proceed step by step:

- Node 0: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 1: Forms one 3-star: <1, (15, 9, 16)>.
- Node 2: Forms two 3-stars: <2, (6, 3, 14)> and <2, (2, 11, 18)>.
- Node 3: Forms one 3-star: <3, (5, 13, 2)>.
- Node 4: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 5: Forms one 3-star: <5, (13, 3, 17)>.
- Node 6: Forms one 3-star: <6, (7, 13, 2)>.
- Node 7: Forms three 3-stars: <7, (6, 12, 10)>, <7, (7, 18, 11)>, and <7, (7, 10, 9)>.
- Node 8: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 9: Forms one 3-star: <9, (12, 4, 0)>.
- Node 10: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 11: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 12: Forms one 3-star: <12, (15, 9, 7)>.
- Node 13: Forms one 3-star: <13, (5, 6, 3)>.
- Node 14: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 15: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 16: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 17: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 18: Forms no 3-stars.
- Node 19: Forms no 3-stars.

By counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 9 different 3-stars in the graph. 
Finally, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (15, 9, 16)>, 
<2, (6, 3, 14)>, 
<2, (2, 11, 18)>, 
<3, (5, 13, 2)>, 
<5, (13, 3, 17)>, 
<6, (7, 13, 2)>, 
<7, (6, 12, 10)>, 
<7, (7, 18, 11)>, 
<7, (7, 10, 9)>.
