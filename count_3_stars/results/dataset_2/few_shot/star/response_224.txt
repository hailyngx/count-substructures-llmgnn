Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list and the edges, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all possible 3-star configurations by looking at nodes with exactly three neighbors.
2. Construct the unique 3-stars based on these configurations.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying all the possible 3-star configurations:
- Node 0, 3 neighbors: (9, 4, 1)
- Node 1, 3 neighbors: (6, 3, 2)
- Node 3, 3 neighbors: (9, 4, 1)
- Node 4, 3 neighbors: (7, 5, 3)
- Node 5, 3 neighbors: (6, 7, 2)
- Node 6, 3 neighbors: (9, 5, 1)
- Node 7, 3 neighbors: (9, 4, 8)
- Node 8, 1 neighbor: (7)
- Node 9, 3 neighbors: (6, 2, 3)

Now, let's construct the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 4, 1)>
- <1, (6, 3, 2)>
- <3, (9, 4, 1)>
- <4, (7, 5, 3)>
- <5, (6, 7, 2)>
- <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- <7, (9, 4, 8)>
- <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [8]
