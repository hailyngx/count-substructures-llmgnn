Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 8, 13, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 14, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 6, and node 14

Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 2, 6, 1, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify each 3-star and list them out:

<0, (8, 12, 13)>  
<1, (2, 6, 14)>  
<2, (1, 6, 14)>  
<3, (9, 7, 12)>  
<4, (7, 6, 11)>  
<5, (13, 10, 14)>
