Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are a part of a 3-star.

Node 0 has a 3-star with nodes 11, 8, and 5.
Node 1 has a 3-star with nodes 17, 15, and 7.
Node 5 has a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 7.
Node 6 has a 3-star with nodes 14, 15, and 19.
Node 7 has a 3-star with nodes 17, 2, and 1.
Node 10 has a 3-star with nodes 11, 4, and 16.
Node 11 has a 3-star with nodes 10, 0, and 13.
Node 13 has a 3-star with nodes 11, 18, and 4.
Node 14 has a 3-star with nodes 17, 6, and 18.
Node 15 has a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 6.
Node 16 has a 3-star with nodes 10, 19, and 6.
Node 17 has a 3-star with nodes 14, 7, and 12.
Node 18 has a 3-star with nodes 14, 9, and 13.
Node 19 has a 3-star with nodes 16, 6, and 10.

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (11, 8, 5)>
<1, (17, 15, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<6, (14, 15, 19)>
<7, (17, 2, 1)>
<10, (11, 4, 16)>
<11, (10, 0, 13)>
<13, (11, 18, 4)>
<14, (17, 6, 18)>
<15, (1, 9, 6)>
<16, (10, 19, 6)>
<17, (14, 7, 12)>
<18, (14, 9, 13)>
<19, (16, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
