Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 10, 11, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 14, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 12, 13, 10, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 12, 14, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 10, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 4, 12, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 0, 13, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes such that those three nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (14, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (9, 11, 13)>
<7, (3, 12, 14)>
<9, (8, 10, 3)>
<10, (9, 4, 12)>
<11, (0, 13, 2)>
<13, (6, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
