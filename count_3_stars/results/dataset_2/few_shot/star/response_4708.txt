Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

The 3-stars can be formed around the following nodes: 1, 4, 7, and 8.

For node 1:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
- <7, (4, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 9, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
