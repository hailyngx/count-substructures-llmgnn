Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by first listing all the 3-star patterns we can find:

<0, (8, 14, 7)>
<1, (8, 11, 10)>
<2, (5, 7, 10)>
<3, (4, 14, 5)>
<4, (8, 12, 11)>
<5, (13, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 6, 0)>
<7, (0, 7, 2)>
<8, (4, 12, 5)>
<9, (1, 9, 10)>
<10, (12, 5, 3)>
<11, (8, 1, 11)>
<12, (14, 3, 9)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars we have listed, which is 12. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
