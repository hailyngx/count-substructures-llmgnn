Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list and the provided edges to find all the 3-stars.

Based on the adjacency list and edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<7, (27, 28, 29)>
<9, (3, 6, 23)>
<18, (3, 27, 28)>
<27, (7, 15, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
