Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
The 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (3, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
