Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 8, 13, 5, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 12, 2, 14, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 10, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 11, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 11, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 12, 7, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 9, 10, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 10, 11, 7, 13, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 12, 5, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 5

Response:
There are <6, (1, 7, 11)>, <9, (2, 11, 3)>, <10, (11, 7, 4)>, <4, (10, 8, 13)>, <8, (11, 4, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 12)>, and <12, (6, 10, 11)> unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
