Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:
1. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star:
    - For node 0: No 3-star can be formed since it is connected to exactly 4 nodes.
    - For node 1: <1, (6, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.
    - For node 2: <2, (6, 9, 1)> is a 3-star.
    - For node 3: No 3-star can be formed since it is connected to exactly 2 nodes.
    - For node 4: <4, (9, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.
    - For node 5: No 3-star can be formed since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes.
    - For node 6: <6, (9, 5, 1)> is a 3-star.
    - For node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it is connected to exactly 1 node.
    - For node 8: No 3-star can be formed since it is connected to exactly 4 nodes.
    - For node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)> is a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 2, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 1)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
