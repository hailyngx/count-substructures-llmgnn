Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[0, (4, 1, 5)]>
<[1, (3, 6, 2)]>
<[2, (4, 1, 5)]>
<[3, (4, 7, 8)]>
<[4, (7, 0, 3)]>
<[7, (4, 9, 6)]>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
