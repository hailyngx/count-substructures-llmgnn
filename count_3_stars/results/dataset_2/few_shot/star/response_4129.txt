Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<7, (6, 3, 7)>
<8, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique instances.
