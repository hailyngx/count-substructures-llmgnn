Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three connections:
- Node 18 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to node 11 and node 8.
- Node 14 is connected to node 19.

2. For each of these nodes, check if the nodes they are connected to also form a 3-star configuration. 

Checking Node 18 (with connections to Node 1): 
<18, (1, 6, 7)>

Checking Node 3 (with connections to Node 11 and Node 8): 
<3, (8, 11, 15)>

Checking Node 14 (with connection to Node 19):
<14, (19, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
