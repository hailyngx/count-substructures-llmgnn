Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 can form a 3-star with (7, 0, 2).
2. Node 7 can form a 3-star with (4, 3, 10).
3. Node 1 can form a 3-star with (7, 3, 14).
4. Node 3 can form a 3-star with (7, 1, 9).
5. Node 10 can form a 3-star with (7, 11, 2).
6. Node 11 can form a 3-star with (10, 9, 13).
7. Node 6 can form a 3-star with (11, 5, 15).
8. Node 15 can form a 3-star with (13, 5, 2).
9. Node 16 can form a 3-star with (6, 9, 18).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 10)>, <1, (7, 3, 14)>, <3, (7, 1, 9)>, <10, (7, 11, 2)>, <11, (10, 9, 13)>, <6, (11, 5, 15)>, <15, (13, 5, 2)>, <16, (6, 9, 18)>.
