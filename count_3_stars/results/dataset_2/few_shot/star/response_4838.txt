Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated using the information provided. 

First, let's find all the nodes that are a part of a 3-star structure. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 12
- Node 27

Now, let's find the number of 3-star structures centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (15, 16, 28) and (15, 1, 6).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (17, 2, 20).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (17, 5, 2).
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with (15, 12, 29).
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with (16, 27, 22).

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<1, (15, 16, 28)>
<1, (15, 1, 6)>
<2, (17, 2, 20)>
<5, (17, 5, 2)>
<12, (15, 12, 29)>
