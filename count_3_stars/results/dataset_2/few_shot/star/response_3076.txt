Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes. This forms a 3-star with the central node and three leaves. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all the unique 3-stars.

- From Node 0:
    - <0, (5, 9, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (9, 4, 8)>
    - <0, (9, 2, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 2)>
    - <0, (8, 2, 7)>

- From Node 1:
    - <1, (9, 4, 0)>

- From Node 2:
    - <2, (6, 8, 0)>
    - <2, (6, 0, 7)>
    - <2, (8, 0, 7)>

- From Node 3:
    - <3, (5, 7, 4)>
    - <3, (7, 4, 0)>

- From Node 4:
    - <4, (6, 1, 0)>
    - <4, (6, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (6, 8, 2)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 8, 0)>
    - <4, (3, 8, 0)>
    - <4, (8, 2, 0)>

- From Node 5:
    - <5, (9, 0, 3)>

- From Node 6:
    - <6, (9, 7, 2)>

- From Node 7:
    - <7, (6, 3, 2)>
    - <7, (3, 2, 0)>

- From Node 8:
    - <8, (9, 4, 0)>

- From Node 9:
    - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (5, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
