Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-star graphs. In this case, the nodes are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2. For each potential center node, identify its neighbors. These neighbors will be part of the 3-star graph with the potential center as the central node.

3. Count the 3-stars for each potential center node.

Let's start finding the 3-stars:

For node 2:
- <2, (9, 1, 7)>
- <2, (9, 8, 0)>
Count: 2

For node 3:
- <3, (5, 9, 4)>
- <3, (5, 8, 6)>
Count: 2

For node 4:
- <4, (8, 0, 3)>
Count: 1

For node 5:
- <5, (8, 3, 7)>
- <5, (8, 6, 7)>
Count: 2

For node 6:
- <6, (5, 8, 7)>
Count: 1

For node 7:
- <7, (5, 6, 2)>
Count: 1

For node 8:
- <8, (5, 4, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
Count: 2

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
