Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique combinations of a central node connected to three other nodes.

To find the total number of 3-stars, we can iterate over each node and count the number of 3-stars centered at that node. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (2, 23, 0)>
<9, (0, 16, 7)>
<22, (23, 26, 11)>
<23, (5, 22, 25)>
<4, (8, 24, 10)>
<8, (4, 15, 24)>
<15, (8, 29, 24)>
<20, (17, 29, 12)>
<21, (28, 13, 21)>
<26, (22, 4, 27)>
<13, (21, 0, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
