Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 21: <1, (4, 12, 21)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, and 25: <5, (3, 13, 25)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 15, and 28: <6, (12, 15, 28)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 17, and 25: <8, (2, 17, 25)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 29: <9, (0, 12, 29)>
6. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 18, and 21: <10, (15, 18, 21)>
7. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 16, and 29: <13, (5, 16, 29)>
8. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 26, and 28: <19, (17, 26, 28)>
9. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 20: <23, (16, 17, 20)>
10. Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 11, and 26: <24, (7, 11, 26)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
