Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by checking each node to see how many 3-stars it is a part of. Let's go through each node and count the number of 3-stars it participates in.

- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 0
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 19: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 22: 1
- Node 23: 1
- Node 24: 1
- Node 25: 1
- Node 26: 1
- Node 27: 0
- Node 28: 1
- Node 29: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (29, 17, 8)>
<3, (7, 13, 5)>
<4, (10, 25, 6)>
<5, (10, 3, 25)>
<6, (16, 4, 23)>
<8, (29, 19, 11)>
<10, (26, 14, 4)>
<11, (17, 8, 21)>
<13, (2, 18, 3)>
<14, (29, 26, 24)>
<15, (29, 22, 6)>
<16, (19, 21, 6)>
<17, (29, 22, 20)>
<18, (22, 23, 20)>
<19, (8, 7, 16)>
<20, (18, 17, 28)>
<22, (18, 15, 17)>
