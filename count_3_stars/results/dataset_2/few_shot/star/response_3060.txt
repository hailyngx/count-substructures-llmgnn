Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars by locating the central node and its three connected nodes. 

From the adjacency list and the given edges, we can see that the 3-stars are formed as follows:
1. <0, (4, 5, 2)>
2. <1, (6, 5, 2)>
3. <2, (9, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (8, 0, 2)>
5. <4, (9, 8, 0)>
6. <5, (4, 2, 1)>
7. <6, (9, 1, 8)>
8. <7, (9, 8, 1)>
9. <8, (6, 4, 3)>
10. <9, (6, 4, 2)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
