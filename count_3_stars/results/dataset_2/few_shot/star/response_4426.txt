Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges (leaves) connected to them. These nodes will be the potential central nodes of the 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 0, 3, and 10.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by checking each potential central node:

For Node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 4.
There is no 3-star centered at Node 0 because it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

For Node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 12, 5, and 4.
There is no 3-star centered at Node 3 because it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes as well.

For Node 10:
Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 8.
<10, (11, 0, 8)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <10, (11, 0, 8)>.
