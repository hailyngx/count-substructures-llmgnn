Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three connected nodes for each 3-star pattern. 

Here are the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (9, 8, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (4, 2, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star patterns listed above, we find that there are 10 different 3-star patterns in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
