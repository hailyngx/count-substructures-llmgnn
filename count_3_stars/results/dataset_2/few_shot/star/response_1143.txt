Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 5: <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 5: <3, (7, 9, 5)>

[There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
