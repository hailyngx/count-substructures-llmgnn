Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 8, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 8, 12, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 8, 13, 5, 0, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 13, 2, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, 4, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 2, 14, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 
A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-star patterns we can find in the given graph and their count:

<0, (11, 8, 2)>
<0, (11, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<1, (3, 11, 4)>
<1, (3, 1, 8)>
<1, (11, 0, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 14, 5)>
<7, (10, 8, 13)>
<7, (8, 13, 0)>
<8, (1, 13, 7)>
<12, (6, 14, 12)>
<13, (3, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
