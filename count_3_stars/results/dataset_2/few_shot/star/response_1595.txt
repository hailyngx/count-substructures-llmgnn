Response:
First, we will find all the 3-stars in the given graph. Then we will count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (25, 24, 21)>
<2, (4, 5, 16)>
<3, (20, 10, 17)>
<4, (7, 12, 11)>
<5, (26, 2, 11)>
<6, (18, 13, 11)>
<7, (14, 5, 13)>
<8, (24, 15, 8)>
<9, (27, 12, 3)>
<10, (28, 21, 26)>
<11, (17, 5, 6)>
<12, (10, 27, 23)>
<13, (18, 7, 15)>
<14, (5, 7, 13)>
<15, (22, 15, 13)>
<16, (24, 2, 15)>
<17, (23, 11, 3)>
<18, (13, 6, 11)>
<19, (29, 25, 3)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [19] unique 3-stars.
