Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Based on the adjacency list provided, we find the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 14.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 1.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 11.

2. Now, we construct the 3-stars using these nodes as the center:
   - From Node 4: <4, (8, 14, x)> (x can be any neighbor of node 8 or 14)
   - From Node 5: <5, (0, 12, 7)>
   - From Node 6: <6, (9, 1, x)> (x can be any neighbor of node 9 or 1)
   - From Node 9: <9, (6, 11, x)> (x can be any neighbor of node 6 or 11)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (8, 14, x)>
<5, (0, 12, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, x)>
<9, (6, 11, x)>
