Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the given information, we can identify the central node for each 3-star since it has a degree of 3. We can then list all the leaves connected to each central node.
2. We then check for all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Here's a list of all the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (15, 14, 16)>
<1, (17, 2, 10)>
<2, (13, 4, 14)>
<3, (11, 6, None)>
<4, (8, 19, 11)>
<5, (13, 16, None)>
<6, (3, 0, 18)>
<7, (11, 17, None)>
<8, (13, 10, None)>
<9, (14, 16, 18)>
<10, (8, 1, 9)>
<11, (3, 8, 4)>
<12, (15, 6, None)>
<13, (8, 5, None)>
<14, (0, 9, 2)>
<15, (0, 12, None)>
<16, (0, 5, 19)>
<17, (1, 7, None)>
<18, (9, 6, None)>
<19, (4, 16, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
