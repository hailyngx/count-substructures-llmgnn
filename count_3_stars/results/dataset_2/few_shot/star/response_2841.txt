Response:
Let's find the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 18. This forms a 3-star: <2, (11, 7, 18)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 19, and 12. This forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 19, 12)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 16, and 3. This forms a 3-star: <4, (11, 16, 3)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 18. This forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 10, 18)>
5. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <15, (3, 19, 6)>
6. Node 17 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 0. This forms a 3-star: <17, (15, 2, 0)>
7. Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <18, (4, 7, 2)>
8. Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 12. This also forms a 3-star: <19, (3, 15, 12)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So the final answer is [8].
