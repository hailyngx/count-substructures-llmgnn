Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (14, 4, 1)>
<1, (0, 16, 5)>
<2, (9, 18, -)>
<3, (11, 10, -)>
<4, (9, 0, 17)>
<5, (14, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, -)>
<7, (16, 5, -)>
<8, (18, 11, -)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<10, (16, 6, 3)>
<11, (8, 3, 13)>
<12, (17, 4, 15)>
<13, (17, 11, 19)>
<14, (9, 0, 19)>
<15, (18, 12, 16)>
<16, (1, 7, 10)>
<17, (13, 4, 12)>
<18, (2, 8, 15)>
<19, (14, 13, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
