Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: It forms 2 unique 3-stars.
   - <0, (2, 7, 28)>
   - <0, (2, 7, 23)>

2. Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 1.

3. Node 2: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
   - <2, (1, 24, 28)>

4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
   - <4, (26, 24, 14)>

6. Node 5: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
   - <5, (25, 11, 26)>

7. Node 6: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
   - <6, (25, 26, 22)>

8. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 9.

11. Node 10: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
    - <10, (11, 17, 15)>

12. Node 11: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 11.

13. Node 12: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 12.

14. Node 13: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 13.

15. Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 14.

16. Node 15: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 15.

17. Node 16: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 16.

18. Node 17: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 17.

19. Node 18: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 18.

20. Node 19: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 19.

21. Node 20: It forms 1 unique 3-star.
    - <20, (25, 15, 18)>

22. Node 21: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 21.

23. Node 22: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 22.

24. Node 23: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 23.

25. Node 24: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 24.

26. Node 25: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 25.

27. Node 26: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 26.

28. Node 27: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 27.

29. Node 28: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 28.

30. Node 29: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 29.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
