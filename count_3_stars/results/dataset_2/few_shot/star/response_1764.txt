Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (10, 1, 9)>
2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 9, 6)>
3. Node 2:
   - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
4. Node 3:
   - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
5. Node 4:
   - <4, (7, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (7, 6, 3)>
6. Node 5:
   - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
7. Node 6:
   - <6, (4, 7, 1)>
8. Node 7:
   - No new 3-star as we have already counted it with node 4.
9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
10. Node 9:
    - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
11. Node 10:
    - No new 3-star as we have already counted it with node 0.
12. Node 11:
    - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
13. Node 12:
    - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.
14. Node 13:
    - No new 3-star as we have already counted it with node 4.
15. Node 14:
    - No 3-star as it does not have three connections to other nodes.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (10, 1, 9)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, and <6, (4, 7, 1)>.
