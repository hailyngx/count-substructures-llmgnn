Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. First, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
   - From the given edges, it seems that the nodes involved in 3-stars are the ones that have at least two common neighbors.
   - Let's identify these nodes: Node 5, Node 14, and Node 18 have at least two common neighbors (Nodes 4, 12, and 18).

2. Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars involving each of these nodes:
   - For Node 5: (3, 5, 12), (5, 12, 14), (5, 7, 13), (5, 14, 18), (5, 14, 11), (5, 14, 12), (5, 14, 8), (5, 14, 5), (5, 14, 18), (5, 14, 18), (5, 14, 12), (5, 14, 14), (5, 14, 12)
   - For Node 14: (5, 12, 14), (8, 14, 5), (11, 14, 12), (12, 14, 18), (14, 5, 12), (14, 5, 18), (14, 8, 5), (14, 11, 5), (14, 11, 12), (14, 12, 18), (14, 18, 5), (14, 18, 18), (14, 18, 6), (14, 18, 0), (14, 18, 19), (14, 18, 12)
   - For Node 18: (4, 12, 14), (4, 18, 5), (4, 18, 6), (4, 18, 0), (4, 18, 19), (12, 18, 14), (14, 18, 5), (14, 18, 6), (14, 18, 0), (14, 18, 19)

3. Let's eliminate duplicate 3-stars and list all unique 3-stars:
   - <3, 5, 12>, <5, 7, 13>, <5, 14, 11>, <5, 14, 12>, <5, 14, 18>, <5, 14, 8>, <8, 14, 5>, <11, 14, 12>, <12, 14, 18>, <14, 18, 5>, <14, 18, 6>, <14, 18, 0>, <14, 18, 19>, <18, 4, 12>, <18, 4, 14>, <18, 4, 12>, <18, 6, 4>, <18, 14, 5>, <18, 14, 6>, <18, 14, 0>, <18, 14, 19>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
