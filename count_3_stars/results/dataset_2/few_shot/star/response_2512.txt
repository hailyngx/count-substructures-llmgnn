Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star graph. Let's identify them:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 4, and 0
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, and 2
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 3, and 2
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 1, 2, and 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 0, and 2
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 9, 1, 4, 0, 3, and 7
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 4, and 2
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 9, 3, and 4
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, and 0
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 4

From the above analysis, we can see that the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star graph are: 2, 6, 1, 8. 

Let's count the number of 3-star graphs: 

- For node 2: <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>
- For node 6: <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- For node 1: <1, (5, 4, 2)>
- For node 8: <8, (9, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
