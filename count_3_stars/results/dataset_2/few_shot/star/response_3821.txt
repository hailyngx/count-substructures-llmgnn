Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the central nodes:

Central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Central Nodes: 2, 13, 24, 0, 15, 5, 18, 8, 10, 29

2. Find the leaves connected to each central node:

- Central Node: 2
  Leaves: 3, 0

- Central Node: 13
  Leaves: 26, 11, 23

- Central Node: 24
  Leaves: 26, 17, 21

- Central Node: 0
  Leaves: 2, 16, 29

- Central Node: 15
  Leaves: 29, 9, 6

- Central Node: 5
  Leaves: 29, 21, 27

- Central Node: 18
  Leaves: 7, 8, 13

- Central Node: 8
  Leaves: 18, 6, 12

- Central Node: 10
  Leaves: 27, 1, 28

- Central Node: 29
  Leaves: 5, 0, 15

3. Identify the 3-stars:

- <2, (3, 0)>
- <13, (26, 11, 23)>
- <24, (26, 17, 21)>
- <0, (2, 16, 29)>
- <15, (29, 9, 6)>
- <5, (29, 21, 27)>
- <18, (7, 8, 13)>
- <8, (18, 6, 12)>
- <10, (27, 1, 28)>
- <29, (5, 0, 15)>

Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
