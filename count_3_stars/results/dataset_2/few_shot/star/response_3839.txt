Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars (Connected to 3 nodes)
2. Node 1: 1 possible 3-star <1, (3, 10, 13)>
3. Node 2: 1 possible 3-star <2, (3, 8, 13)>
4. Node 3: 2 possible 3-stars <3, (5, 1, 11)> and <3, (1, 2, 12)>
5. Node 4: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
6. Node 5: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
7. Node 6: 2 possible 3-stars <6, (9, 7, 12)> and <6, (7, 4, 12)>
8. Node 7: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
9. Node 8: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
10. Node 9: No 3-stars (Connected to 1 node)
11. Node 10: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
12. Node 11: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
13. Node 12: 2 possible 3-stars <12, (6, 3, 4)> and <12, (2, 8, 10)>
14. Node 13: No 3-stars (Connected to more than 3 nodes)
15. Node 14: No 3-stars (Connected to 3 nodes)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 2 (from Node 3) + 2 (from Node 6) + 2 (from Node 12) = 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
  
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 10, 13)>
<2, (3, 8, 13)>
<3, (5, 1, 11)>
<3, (1, 2, 12)>
<6, (9, 7, 12)>
<6, (7, 4, 12)>
<12, (6, 3, 4)>
<12, (2, 8, 10)>
