Response:
The nodes in the graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center at node 0: (26, 25, 13) 
2. 3-star with center at node 1: (9, 11, 27)
3. 3-star with center at node 2: (7, 25, 16)
4. 3-star with center at node 3: (28, 29, 19)
5. 3-star with center at node 4: (24, 12, 16)
6. 3-star with center at node 5: (9, 17, 18)
7. 3-star with center at node 6: (21, 13, 25)
8. 3-star with center at node 7: (14, 19, 25)
9. 3-star with center at node 8: (22, 11, 7)
10. 3-star with center at node 9: (5, 17, 1)
11. 3-star with center at node 10: NOT POSSIBLE (only connected to one node)
12. 3-star with center at node 11: (1, 12, 19)
13. 3-star with center at node 12: (4, 20, 11)
14. 3-star with center at node 13: (6, 21, 25)
15. 3-star with center at node 14: NOT POSSIBLE (only connected to one node)
16. 3-star with center at node 15: NOT POSSIBLE (only connected to one node)
17. 3-star with center at node 16: (24, 2, 23)
18. 3-star with center at node 17: (9, 29, 5)
19. 3-star with center at node 18: (25, 5, 18)
20. 3-star with center at node 19: (11, 14, 20)
21. 3-star with center at node 20: (12, 19, 4)
22. 3-star with center at node 21: (6, 13, 23)
23. 3-star with center at node 22: NOT POSSIBLE (only connected to one node)
24. 3-star with center at node 23: (21, 16, 2)
25. 3-star with center at node 24: (26, 16, 4)
26. 3-star with center at node 25: (18, 0, 2)
27. 3-star with center at node 26: (24, 10, 0)
28. 3-star with center at node 27: NOT POSSIBLE (only connected to one node)
29. 3-star with center at node 28: (29, 3, 0)
30. 3-star with center at node 29: (17, 28, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
