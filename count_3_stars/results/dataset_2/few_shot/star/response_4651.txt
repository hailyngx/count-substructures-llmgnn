Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors):
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 10, Node 12

2. For each central node, identify the 3-stars:
   
   For Node 0: None (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
   
   For Node 1:
   - <1, (11, 12, 7)>
   
   For Node 3:
   - <3, (7, 13, 2)>
   
   For Node 10:
   - <10, (11, 12, 7)>
   
   For Node 12:
   - <12, (11, 1, 8)>
   - <12, (10, 11, 8)>
   - <1, (11, 12, 8)>  (repeating, but listing unique combinations)
   - <10, (11, 12, 8)> (repeating, but listing unique combinations)
   
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (11, 12, 7)>, <3, (7, 13, 2)>, <10, (11, 12, 7)>, <12, (11, 1, 8)>, <12, (10, 11, 8)>, <1, (11, 12, 8)>.
