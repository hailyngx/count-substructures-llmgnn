Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that can act as the center node in a 3-star. 

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. Let's identify the unique 3-stars by listing the center node and its 3 connected nodes:

<4, (7, 18, 27)>
<7, (4, 12, 25)>
<12, (7, 20, 24)>
<18, (4, 26, 29)>
<26, (13, 15, 25)>
<1, (25, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 11, -)>
<3, (27, 9, 29)>
<5, (0, 19, 20)>
<6, (19, -, -)>
<8, (28, 10, 1)>
<9, (3, 15, 14)>
<10, (19, 8, 24)>
<11, (7, 2, 1)>
<13, (26, 20, 14)>
<14, (13, 22, 9)>
<15, (26, 23, 9)>
<16, (26, -, -)>
<17, (28, 23, 22)>
<19, (6, 5, 10)>
<20, (12, 13, 28)>
<21, (0, 25, -)>
<22, (17, 14, -)>
<23, (27, 17, 15)>
<24, (7, 12, 10)>
<25, (7, 26, 21)>
<28, (8, 17, 20)>
<29, (18, 3, 23)>

The number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
