Response:
Based on the given information, the number of unique 3-stars in the graph can be computed by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star in the graph. Below are the steps to find the count of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

    - Node 7 is connected to only one node (node 29).
    - Node 9 is connected to one node (node 16).
    - Node 4, 12, 19, and 23 each have only two neighbors, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
    
2. Check nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    
    - Node 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 25 have more or less than three neighbors, so they also cannot be the center of a 3-star.
    - Node 13 has three neighbors: 22, 16, and 11. Thus, a 3-star with center at node 13 and leaves at nodes 22, 16, and 11 is found: <13, (22, 16, 11)>.
    - Node 2, 3, 6, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28, 29 do not have exactly three neighbors, so they are not the center of a 3-star.
    
Hence, the number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [1].
