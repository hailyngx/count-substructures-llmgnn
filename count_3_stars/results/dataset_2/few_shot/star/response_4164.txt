Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 7, 1)>
<0, (9, 2, 8)>
<0, (7, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 0, 9)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 6, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
