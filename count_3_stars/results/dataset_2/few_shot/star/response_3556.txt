Response:
From the given graph, we can identify the number of 3-stars by checking each node and seeing if it forms a 3-star with exactly three neighbors. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph: 

<0, (1, 2, 13)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 11)>
<5, (3, 13, 15)>
<7, (3, 15, 16)>
<9, (6, 7, 17)>
<10, (0, 15, 19)>
<11, (3, 5, 19)>
<12, (4, 13, 18)>
<13, (0, 5, 12)>
<15, (7, 10, 16)>
<16, (7, 15, 17)>
<17, (6, 7, 16)>
<18, (1, 8, 13)>
<19, (10, 11, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
