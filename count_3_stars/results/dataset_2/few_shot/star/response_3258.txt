Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 11, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, 11, 0, 10, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 11, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 14, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 13, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 9, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify each 3-star in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<7, (8, 0, 14)>
<11, (6, 3, 1)>
<13, (9, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
