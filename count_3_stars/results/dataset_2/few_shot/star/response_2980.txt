Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 18, 16)>
<5, (17, 11, 16)>
<7, (12, 15, 19)>
<9, (8, 10, 12)>
<11, (5, 18, 15)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6].
