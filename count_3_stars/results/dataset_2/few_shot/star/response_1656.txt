Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 14: <4, (6, 13, 14)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 4: <7, (3, 9, 4)>
3. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 6: <0, (1, 8, 6)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 14: <3, (10, 11, 14)>
5. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 14: <2, (9, 11, 14)>
6. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 10: <12, (5, 9, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
