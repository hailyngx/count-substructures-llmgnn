Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Reviewing the adjacency list, we can identify the central node and its neighbors connected by edges.
2. For each central node, if it has exactly three neighbors, we have found a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<3, (12, 29, 6)>
<3, (12, 18, 5)>
<4, (9, 28, 10)>
<7, (21, 12, 14)>
<9, (16, 22, 4)>
<10, (15, 26, 2)>
<12, (7, 2, 13)>
<16, (11, 29, 6)>
<18, (17, 23, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
