Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node's adjacency list:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 13: No 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 18 and 6: No 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 10, and 15: <2, (16, 6, 15)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 19, 17, 12, and 4: No 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 11: No 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 11, 16, and 7: <5, (12, 11, 7)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 1: No 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 5, 0, and 15: <7, (18, 5, 15)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 15: No 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 14 and 19: No 3-star.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 12, and 14: <10, (2, 12, 14)>.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 4: No 3-star.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 17, 3, 10, and 11: No 3-star.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0 and 16: No 3-star.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 10: <14, (9, 15, 10)>.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 18, 7, 8, and 14: No 3-star.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 13: No 3-star.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3 and 12: No 3-star.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 1: No 3-star.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9 and 3: No 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are <2, (16, 6, 15)>, <5, (12, 11, 7)>, <10, (2, 12, 14)>, and <14, (9, 15, 10)>.  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
