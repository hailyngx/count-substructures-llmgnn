Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 14, 10, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 14, 5, 10, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 4, 2, 9, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, 2, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 13, 0, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 8, 12, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-star graphs. 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 14, 5, 10, and 12
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 2, 9, 14, and 7
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 14

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the 3-stars they are the center of. Count each unique 3-star.
- For Node 1: 
  - <1, (3, 2, 14)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 10)>
  - <1, (3, 10, 12)>
  - <1, (2, 5, 12)>
  - Total: 4
- For Node 8:
  - <8, (13, 4, 2)>
  - <8, (13, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (13, 9, 7)>
  - Total: 3
- For Node 12:
  - <12, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <12, (1, 3, 14)>
  - <12, (1, 7, 14)>
  - Total: 3

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.
- Total 3-star graphs = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10
