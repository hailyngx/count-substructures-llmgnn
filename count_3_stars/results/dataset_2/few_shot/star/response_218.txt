Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-star configurations. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<10, (9, 0, 4)>
<9, (10, 1, 3)>
<1, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (8, 12, 13)>
<7, (10, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 1, 5)>
<5, (10, 8, _missing_node_)>
<11, (10, 7, 1)>
<12, (11, 2, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 3)>
<4, (6, 10, 13)>
<0, (10, 11, 8)>
<14, (7, 3, _missing_node_)>
<6, (4, 13, _missing_node_)>
<3, (9, 13, 14)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
