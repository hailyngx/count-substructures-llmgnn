Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by examining each node's connections to see where 3-stars exist.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[7]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
