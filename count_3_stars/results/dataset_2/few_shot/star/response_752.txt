Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list out the 3-stars by looking at the adjacency list for each node:
<Node 3, (0, 12, 24)>
<Node 4, (8, 18, 28)>
<Node 5, (9, 19, 27)>
<Node 6, (11, 15, 29)>
<Node 9, (5, 14, 20)>
<Node 10, (25, 14, 21)>
<Node 11, (19, 6)>
<Node 12, (25, 8, 0)>
<Node 13, (21, 6)>
<Node 14, (16, 9, 10)>
<Node 15, (6, 3, 17)>
<Node 16, (14)>
<Node 17, (15, 22, 1)>
<Node 18, (4, 26, 24)>
<Node 19, (11, 5, 20)>
<Node 20, (9, 25, 23)>
<Node 21, (13, 10, 29)>
<Node 22, (2, 3, 17)>
<Node 23, (20, 8, 27)>
<Node 24, (18, 0)>
<Node 25, (20, 27, 12)>
<Node 26, (18, 2)>
<Node 27, (5, 25, 23)>
<Node 28, (4, 18)>
<Node 29, (1, 21, 6)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars. 
There are 26 unique 3-stars in total.
