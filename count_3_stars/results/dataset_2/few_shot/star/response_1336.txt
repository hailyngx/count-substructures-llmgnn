Response:
We need to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edge list and adjacency list, let's analyze each node to find any 3-stars.

1. Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 5 and 10. Potential 3-star: <1, (5, 10)>
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 11, 6, and 3. Potential 3-star: <2, (11, 6, 3)>
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, and 17. No 3-star.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 12, 14, and 3. No 3-star.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 16. No 3-star.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 12, 2, 8, and 13. No 3-star.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 12, 10, and 18. No 3-star.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 14, 17, and 6. No 3-star.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 17, 13, and 12. No 3-star.
11. Node 10: Connected to nodes 7, 11, 1, and 19. No 3-star.
12. Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, 18, and 2. No 3-star.
13. Node 12: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, and 6. Potential 3-star: <12, (9, 4, 7)>
14. Node 13: Connected to nodes 9, 6, 15, and 14. No 3-star.
15. Node 14: Connected to nodes 4, 8, and 13. No 3-star.
16. Node 15: Connected to nodes 19 and 13. No 3-star.
17. Node 16: Connected to node 5. No 3-star.
18. Node 17: Connected to nodes 9, 8, and 3. No 3-star.
19. Node 18: Connected to nodes 7, 11, and 19. No 3-star.
20. Node 19: Connected to nodes 10, 18, and 15. No 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (5, 10)>, <2, (11, 6, 3)>, and <12, (9, 4, 7)>. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
