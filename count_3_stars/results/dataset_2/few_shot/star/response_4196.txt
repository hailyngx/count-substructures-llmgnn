Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 14, 7, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 0, 5, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 0, 5, 12, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 14, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 0, 4, 12, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 13, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 11, 13, 9, 7, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 10, 8, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 6, 8, 4, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 0, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<1, (3, 9, 14)>
<10, (4, 8, 9)>
<11, (0, 8, 10)>
<8, (7, 13, 9)>
<0, (7, 11, 14)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<14, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
