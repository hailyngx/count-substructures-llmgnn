Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see the nodes connected to each central node:
- Node 0 has 3 stars: (0, 11, 19), (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 10)
- Node 1 has 1 star: (1, 0, 7)
- Node 2 has 1 star: (2, 13, 3)
- Node 3 has 1 star: (3, 11, 8)
- Node 4 has 1 star: (4, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 0 stars
- Node 6 has 1 star: (6, 15, 17)
- Node 7 has 1 star: (7, 1, 18)
- Node 8 has 1 star: (8, 11, 15)
- Node 9 has 0 stars
- Node 10 has 0 stars
- Node 11 has 1 star: (11, 8, 15)
- Node 12 has 0 stars
- Node 13 has 0 stars
- Node 14 has 0 stars
- Node 15 has 0 stars
- Node 16 has 0 stars
- Node 17 has 0 stars
- Node 18 has 0 stars
- Node 19 has 0 stars

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (11, 19, 0)>, <0, (1, 7, 0)>, <0, (2, 10, 0)>, <1, (0, 7, 1)>, <2, (13, 3, 2)>, <3, (11, 8, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (15, 17, 6)>, <7, (1, 18, 7)>, <8, (11, 15, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
