Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and its neighbors to see if a 3-star centered at that node can be formed. 

Node 0: (1, 3, 4)
Node 1: (0, 6, 7)
Node 2: (5, 8, 9)
Node 3: (0, 5, 8)
Node 4: (0, 5, 6)
Node 5: (2, 4, 7)
Node 6: (1, 3, 4)
Node 7: (1, 5, 6)
Node 8: (2, 3, 9)
Node 9: (0, 2, 8)

Now, we will list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
