Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the centers of the 3-stars. Here are the nodes that meet this criterion:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 21, and 29.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 24.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 27, and 1.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 21, and 14.
   - Node 20 is connected to nodes 26, 8, and 27.
   - Node 26 is connected to nodes 10, 20, and 28.
   
2. For each of the identified nodes, construct the 3-stars using them as the center node and the nodes they are connected to as the leaves.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 21, 29)>
<9, (6, 4, 24)>
<10, (26, 27, 1)>
<18, (11, 21, 14)>
<20, (26, 8, 27)>
<26, (10, 20, 28)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
