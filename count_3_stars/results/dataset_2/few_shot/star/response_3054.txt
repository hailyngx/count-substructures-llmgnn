Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected:
Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected are: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 17.

2. For each of these nodes, identify the adjacent nodes connected by these 3 edges:
- For Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 17), (1, 7)
- For Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 3)
- For Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 2), (3, 11)
- For Node 17: (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 14)

3. Count the number of 3-stars formed by the identified patterns:
- <1, (7, 17, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 3)>
- <3, (11, 2, 11)>
- <17, (14, 1, 14)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. So, the answer is [4].]
