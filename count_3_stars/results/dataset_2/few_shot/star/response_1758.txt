Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars.

First, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star pattern.

1. Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the possible 3-stars in the graph:
   - Node 0: (0, 3, 8, 7) or (0, 3, 4, 7)
   - Node 1: (1, 3, 6, 8) or (1, 3, 7, 8)
   - Node 2: (2, 5, 8, 6)
   - Node 3: (3, 1, 0, 8), (3, 1, 6, 8), or (3, 4, 9, 0)
   - Node 4: (4, 5, 9, 3) or (4, 5, 0, 3)
   - Node 5: (5, 2, 4, 7)
   - Node 6: (6, 1, 3, 7) or (6, 2, 3, 7)
   - Node 7: (7, 5, 1, 8) or (7, 5, 0, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 1, 3, 0) or (8, 2, 3, 6)

Let's count the total number of unique 3-star patterns.

The total number of 3-stars: [8]

<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
