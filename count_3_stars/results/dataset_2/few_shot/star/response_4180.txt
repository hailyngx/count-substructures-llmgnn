Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 18, 1)>
2. Node 1: No 3-star
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 8, 13)>
4. Node 3: <3, (11, 19, 8)>
5. Node 4: No 3-star
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 14)>
7. Node 6: <6, (15, 14, 19)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star
9. Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 2)>
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 10, 16)>
11. Node 10: <10, (9, 14, 2)>
12. Node 11: <11, (3, 7, 17)>
13. Node 12: No 3-star
14. Node 13: No 3-star
15. Node 14: No 3-star
16. Node 15: No 3-star
17. Node 16: No 3-star
18. Node 17: No 3-star
19. Node 18: No 3-star
20. Node 19: <19, (3, 11, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 18, 1)>, <2, (5, 8, 13)>, <3, (11, 19, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 14)>, <6, (15, 14, 19)>, <10, (9, 14, 2)>, <11, (3, 7, 17)>. Hence, the final answer is [7].
