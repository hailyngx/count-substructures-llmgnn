Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's break down the graph structure and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, 7, and 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 2, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, 8, and 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 1
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 2, and 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 7, and 0

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (1, 8, 6)>
<9, (4, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<2, (8, 3, 4)>

Considering the uniqueness of the identified 3-stars, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
