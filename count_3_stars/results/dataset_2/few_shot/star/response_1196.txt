Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly 3 leaves, we can identify each 3-star by looking at each node's connections.

Here are the 3-star structures in the given graph:
<0, (16, 8, 15)>
<0, (8, 15, 3)>
<1, (14, 6, 15)>
<2, (15, 10, 17)>
<4, (8, 6, 17)>
<4, (17, 9, 11)>
<5, (12, 1, 18)>
<6, (11, 4, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 17)>
<9, (7, 13, 17)>
<9, (13, 9, 19)>
<10, (8, 2, 17)>
<12, (5, 13, 1)>
<14, (1, 6, 15)>
<15, (16, 2, 19)>
<16, (7, 0, 15)>
<17, (11, 8, 4)>
<18, (8, 6, 5)>
<19, (9, 15, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
