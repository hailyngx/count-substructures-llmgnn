Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 15. So, one 3-star is centered at Node 11: <11, (10, 8, 15)>.

Similarly, we can find 3-stars centered at other nodes:
- <10, (11, 7, 19)>
- <16, (7, 2, 6)>
- <2, (16, 18, 9)>
- <18, (15, 4, 2)>
- <4, (18, 19, 0)>
- <5, (10, 13, 5)>
- <6, (1, 16, 8)>
- <7, (16, 10, 9)>
- <8, (11, 9, 0)>
- <9, (2, 17, 8)>
- <15, (11, 18, 17)>
- <19, (10, 4, 3)>
- <1, (6, 12, 1)>
- <12, (13, 1, 12)>
- <14, (3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15].
