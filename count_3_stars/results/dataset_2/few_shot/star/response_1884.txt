Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 14, 3, 4, 5, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 10, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 13, 3, 7, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 0, 7, 10, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 12, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 10, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, 14, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 1, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 14, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 2, 9, 13, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 2, 0, 11, 6, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 10

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (8, 14, 3)>
2. Node 2: <2, (8, 13, 3)>
3. Node 3: <3, (2, 0, 7)>
4. Node 5: <5, (8, 0, 3)>
5. Node 7: <7, (2, 8, 14)>
6. Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 0)>
7. Node 10: <10, (14, 3, 1)>
8. Node 11: <11, (2, 9, 13)>
9. Node 12: <12, (11, 4, 5)>
10. Node 13: <13, (2, 0, 11)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10]
