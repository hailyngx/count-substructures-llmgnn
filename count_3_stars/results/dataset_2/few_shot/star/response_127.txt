Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that there are several potential 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them as <Center, (Leaf 1, Leaf 2, Leaf 3)>:

<5, (9, 3, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<12, (9, 7, 4)>
<0, (6, 14, 4)>
<14, (13, 0, 2)>
<7, (8, 12, 1)>
<13, (9, 2, 14)>
<4, (12, 0, 11)>
<10, (5, 12, 3)>
<1, (7, 12, 10)>
<2, (6, 13, 14)>
<11, (9, 4, 2)>

Based on the listed 3-stars above, we can count the total number of 3-stars as [15].
