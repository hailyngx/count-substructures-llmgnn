Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is the center of a 3-star with exactly three other nodes connected to it. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars centered at node 0.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars centered at node 1.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars centered at node 2.
4. Node 3: <3, (8, 13, 11)>
5. Node 4: No 3-stars centered at node 4.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars centered at node 5.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars centered at node 6.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars centered at node 7.
9. Node 8: <8, (9, 13, 14)>
10. Node 9: No 3-stars centered at node 9.
11. Node 10: No 3-stars centered at node 10.
12. Node 11: <11, (14, 3, 4)>
13. Node 12: No 3-stars centered at node 12.
14. Node 13: No 3-stars centered at node 13.
15. Node 14: No 3-stars centered at node 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
