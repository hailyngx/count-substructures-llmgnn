Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
    - From Node 0: <0, (5, 1, 2)>
    - From Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 2)>
    - From Node 2: <2, (9, 7, 8)>
    - From Node 3: <3, (5, 9, 0)>
    - From Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
    - From Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 0)>
    - From Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 2)>
    - From Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
