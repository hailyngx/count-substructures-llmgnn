Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique 3-star configurations (center node and its connected leaves). Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
    - No 3-star configuration.

2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (4, 24, 25)>
    - <1, (4, 24, 0)>
    - <1, (4, 25, 19)>
    - <1, (24, 25, 0)>
    - <1, (24, 25, 19)>
    - <1, (24, 0, 15)>
    - <1, (25, 0, 15)>
    - <1, (25, 19, 11)>

3. For Node 2:
    - No 3-star configuration.

4. For Node 3:
    - No 3-star configuration.

5. For Node 4:
    - <4, (1, 24, 12)>
