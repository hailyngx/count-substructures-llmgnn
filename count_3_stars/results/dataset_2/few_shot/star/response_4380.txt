Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 8: <0, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 8: <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 3: <2, (6, 4, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 8: <3, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, and 3: <4, (8, 1, 3)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 7: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 2: <7, (9, 6, 2)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 0: <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
