Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the center node of each potential 3-star.  
Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that:
- Node 5 can be the center of a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 4.  
- Node 6 can be the center of a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7.  
- Node 1 can be the center of a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 0.  
- Node 3 can be the center of a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 1.  
- Node 9 can be the center of a 3-star with nodes 6, 3, and 7.  
- Node 2 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, so it can't be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 0 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, so it can't be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 4 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, so it can't be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 7 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, so it can't be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 8 doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, so it can't be the center of a 3-star.

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we have the following:
- <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- <1, (5, 3, 0)>
- <3, (9, 6, 1)>
- <9, (6, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
