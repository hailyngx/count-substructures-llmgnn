Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 3, 13)>
- <1, (9, 2, 14)>
- <2, (7, 12, 1)>
- <3, (6, 9, 0)>
- <4, (5, 13, -)>
- <5, (7, 12, 8)>
- <6, (9, -,-)>
- <7, (12, 10, 2)>
- <8, (9, 5, 14)>
- <9, (6, 8, 10)>
- <10, (7, 3, 1)>
- <12, (7, 2, 5)>
- <13, (6, 7, 0)>
- <14, (12, 8, 3)>

Since we have identified 14 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [14].
