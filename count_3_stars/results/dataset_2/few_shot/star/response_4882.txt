Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present.

First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 5)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
