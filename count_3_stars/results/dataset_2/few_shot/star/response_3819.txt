Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 6, 14, 11), (0, 6, 3, 4)
2. Node 1: (1, 12, 5, 2)
3. Node 2: (2, 9, 8, 14)
4. Node 3: (3, 6, 7, 12), (3, 6, 5, 4)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 3, 11)
6. Node 5: (5, 13, 1, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 9, 7, 3), (6, 9, 2, 14)
8. Node 7: (7, 6, 8, 3), (7, 6, 0, 14)
9. Node 8: (8, 9, 13, 2), (8, 9, 7, 12)
10. Node 9: (9, 6, 8, 2), (9, 6, 14, 12)
11. Node 10: (10, 13, 1, 11)
12. Node 11: (11, 13, 0, 4)
13. Node 12: (12, 9, 8, 3)
14. Node 13: (13, 8, 5, 11)
15. Node 14: (14, 9, 7, 0), (14, 9, 2, 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
Total number of 3-stars: 15
