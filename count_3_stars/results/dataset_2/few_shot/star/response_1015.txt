Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

1. Node 1 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 3, 6, and 13.
2. Node 2 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 6, 8, and 14.
3. Node 3 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 1, 7, and 11.
4. Node 7 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 3, 10, and 14.
5. Node 8 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 1, 9, and 13.
6. Node 10 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 7, 8, and 11.
7. Node 11 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 3, 10, and 12.
8. Node 13 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
9. Node 14 is the center of the 3-star connected to nodes 2, 7, and 1.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and they are:
<1, (3, 6, 13)>
<2, (6, 8, 14)>
<3, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (3, 10, 14)>
<8, (1, 9, 13)>
<10, (7, 8, 11)>
<11, (3, 10, 12)>
<13, (1, 5, 8)>
<14, (2, 7, 1)>
