Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs in the given graph, based on the definition provided. Each node must have exactly three neighbors to form a 3-star.

The nodes that can act as the center of the 3-stars are: 11, 6, 9, 5, 15, and 16.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in this graph that have the above nodes as centers:

<11, (16, 19, 7)>
<6, (16, 9, 5)>
<5, (11, 6, 15)>
<15, (5, 7, 14)>
<16, (11, 13, 6)>
<9, (6, 17, 14)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
