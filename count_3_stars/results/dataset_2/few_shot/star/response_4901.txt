Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes that act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. Let's find all the unique 3-star structures:

- Node 0: (20, 14, 16) <0, (20, 14, 16)>
- Node 1: (27, 15, 6) <1, (27, 15, 6)>
- Node 3: (2, 18, 20) <3, (2, 18, 20)>
- Node 6: (18, 17, 1) <6, (18, 17, 1)>
- Node 9: (26, 7, 23) <9, (26, 7, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
