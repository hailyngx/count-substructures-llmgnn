Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 9, 1, 2
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 9, 2, 7

2. For each node identified above, find the 3-star configurations:

- For Node 0: (0, 9, 1, 2)
- For Node 5: (5, 9, 2, 7)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (9, 1, 2)>
<5, (9, 2, 7)>

4. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
