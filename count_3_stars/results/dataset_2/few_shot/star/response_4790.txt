Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 14, 3, 13, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 12, 2, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 13, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 12, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 10, 14, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 8, 7, 1, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 3, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 11, 4, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 14, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 12, and node 13

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (8, 7, 2)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (8, 11, 12)>
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (8, 7, 1)>
4. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 10, 3)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (9, 11, 4)>
6. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (0, 1, 2)>
7. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.  
So, the final answer is [7].
