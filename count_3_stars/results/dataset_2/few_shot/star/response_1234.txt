Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 13, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 11, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 14, 7, 12, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 10, 11, 13, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 13, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 12, 7, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 6, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 10, 6, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (9, 8, 3)>
<1, (11, 13, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 12)>
<3, (0, 13, 2)>
<4, (1, 11, 14)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (14, 7, 12)>
<7, (10, 11, 13)>
<8, (5, 1, 13)>
<9, (5, 14, 0)>
<10, (11, 12, 14)>
<11, (1, 10, 7)>
<12, (10, 6, 2)>
<13, (1, 3, 8)>
<14, (9, 10, 4)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
