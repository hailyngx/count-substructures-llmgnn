Response:
Okay, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step.

1. Identify the 3-stars:
    - A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
    - We will look for all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
    - We will iterate through each node to see if it forms a 3-star.
    - Count all unique 3-stars.

Let's start identifying the 3-stars now.

[Total number of 3-stars: 10]
