Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the following potential 3-stars:
- Node 1: (17, 10, 19) and (12, 14, 18)
- Node 14: (17, 18, 12) and (2, 3, 0)

Please note that we do not consider nodes where the center node has less than three neighbors. Let's count the total number of such 3-stars in the graph.
