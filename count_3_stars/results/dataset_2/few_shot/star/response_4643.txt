Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
- 3-star: <0, (7, 6, 13)> 
- 3-star: <0, (7, 1, 13)> 

2. For Node 1:
- 3-star: <1, (4, 7, 13)> 
- 3-star: <1, (4, 11, 1)> 

3. For Node 2: 
- No 3-stars centered at Node 2.

4. For Node 3:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 3. 

5. For Node 4:
- 3-star: <4, (7, 1, 3)> 
- 3-star: <4, (7, 12, 1)> 

6. For Node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (8, 11, 3)> 
- 3-star: <5, (8, 14, 3)> 

7. For Node 6:
- 3-star: <6, (4, 9, 10)> 
- 3-star: <6, (4, 9, 14)> 

8. For Node 7:
- 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 1)> 

9. For Node 8:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 8. 

10. For Node 9:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 9. 

11. For Node 10:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 10. 

12. For Node 11:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 11.

13. For Node 12:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 12.

14. For Node 13:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 13. 

15. For Node 14:
- No 3-stars centered at Node 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 6, 13)>
<0, (7, 1, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 11, 1)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 12, 1)>
<5, (8, 11, 3)>
<5, (8, 14, 3)>
<6, (4, 9, 10)>
<6, (4, 9, 14)>
