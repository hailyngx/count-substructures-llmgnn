Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration. Let's start by looking at the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (11, 16, 15)>
2. <1, (11, 12, 13)>
3. <2, (4, 17, 14)>
4. <3, (14, 9)>
5. <4, (8, 2)>
6. <5, (13, 15, 14)>
7. <6, (10, 8, 18)>
8. <7, (12, 14, 13)>
9. <8, (4, 6, 18)>
10. <9, (3, 17, 1)>
11. <10, (6)>
12. <11, (1, 19, 0)>
13. <12, (7, 1)>
14. <13, (7, 5, 1)>
15. <14, (7, 5, 3)>
16. <15, (11, 5, 0)>
17. <16, (0)>
18. <17, (7, 9, 19)>
19. <18, (8, 0, 15)>
20. <19, (11, 17)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
