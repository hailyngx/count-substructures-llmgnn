Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 4, 13)>
<0, (5, 14, 11)>
<0, (5, 13, 0)>
<0, (5, 14, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (7, 5, 1)>
<1, (7, 6, 1)>
<2, (9, 14, 4)>
<2, (9, 14, 2)>
<2, (9, 2, 4)>
<2, (9, 2, 10)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<3, (5, 13, 3)>
<3, (10, 3, 12)>
<3, (10, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 11)>
<4, (0, 13, 4)>
<4, (0, 14, 2)>
<4, (11, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 5, 13)>
<5, (3, 10, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 1, 6)>
<6, (7, 5, 1)>
<6, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (14, 11, 7)>
<7, (14, 0, 7)>
