Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list all the 3-stars and then count them:

<5, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<5, (7, 6, 1)>
<5, (0, 9, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>
<9, (8, 3, 0)>
<9, (2, 8, 0)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 0, 3)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 0, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (9, 5, 2)>
<8, (9, 3, 0)>
<8, (9, 2, 0)>
<8, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (3, 9, 0)>
