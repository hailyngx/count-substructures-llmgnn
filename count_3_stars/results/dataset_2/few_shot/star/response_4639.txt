Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. 

From the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<3, (1, 11, 4)>
<11, (1, 10, 13)>
<4, (9, 3, 13)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 10, 14)>
<8, (9, 2, 12)>
<10, (6, 11, 7)>
<12, (5, 3, 8)>
<13, (5, 1, 11)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<14, (9, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[14]
