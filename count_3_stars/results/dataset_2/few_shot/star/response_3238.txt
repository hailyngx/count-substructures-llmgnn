Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can simply look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (8, 4, 6)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<9, (8, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
