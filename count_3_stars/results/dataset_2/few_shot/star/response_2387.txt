Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can easily identify the 3-stars by locating the central node and its three connected nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<25, (29, 14, 21)>
<14, (27, 4, 26)>
<11, (7, 6, 21)>
<21, (25, 16, 11)>
<16, (15, 11, 17)>
<17, (24, 16, 29)>
<18, (3, 5, 24)>
<29, (25, 10, 3)>
<3, (1, 29, 18)>
<5, (8, 18, 28)>
<26, (15, 14, 2)>
<7, (20, 11, 0)>
<0, (12, 7, 6)>
<10, (19, 29, 1)>
<2, (21, 26, 28)>
<12, (6, 0, 23)>
<23, (18, 12, 9)>
<4, (15, 24, 14)>
<8, (25, 5, 28)>
<27, (14, 3, 27)>
<22, (14, 22)>
<13, (25, 23, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [22] 3-stars in the graph.
