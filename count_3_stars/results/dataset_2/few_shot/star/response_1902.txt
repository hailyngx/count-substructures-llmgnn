Response:
First, identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Nodes with exactly three neighbors can be centers of 3-stars. 

- The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 1, 3, and 5.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will check how many 3-stars they are part of.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 10.
- So, <1, (10, X, X)> is the only 3-star with center at node 1.
  
For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to node 4, 11, and 14.
- So, <3, (4, 11, 14)> is the only 3-star with center at node 3.
  
For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and 0.
- So, <5, (7, 8, 0)> is the only 3-star with center at node 5.

Combining all the unique 3-stars found, we get: <1, (10, X, X)>, <3, (4, 11, 14)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
