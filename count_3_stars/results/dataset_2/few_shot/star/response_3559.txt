Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any of the 30 nodes in the graph. Let's iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star:

1. For each node, check its neighbors to find pairs of neighbors that are also connected to each other. These pairs of neighbors with a common connection to the central node form 3-stars.
2. Count and list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start checking and counting the 3-stars:
