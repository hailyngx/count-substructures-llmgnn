Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Here are the unique 3-star patterns found in the graph:

<0, (25, 19, 21)>
<1, (10, 24, 29)>
<2, (20, 6, 0)>
<3, (26, 22, -)>
<4, (18, -, -)>
<5, (21, -, -)>
<7, (12, 6, 22)>
<8, (23, 16, -)>
<9, (28, 14, 0)>
<11, (10, -, -)>
<13, (24, 29, 28)>
<14, (21, 19, 9)>
<15, (23, 20, 17)>
<16, (8, 27, -)>
<18, (4, 26, 27)>
<25, (0, -, -)>
<26, (3, 18, 19)>
<27, (18, 16, -)>
<29, (10, 6, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
