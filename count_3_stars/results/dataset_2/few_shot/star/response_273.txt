Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 8, and 6.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 0 as the central node.

2. For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 2.
- There is no 3-star with Node 1 as the central node.

3. For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 8.
- There is a 3-star with Node 2 as the central node: <2, (7, 1, 8)>.

4. For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0.
- There is no 3-star with Node 3 as the central node.

5. For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 0, 6, and 3.
- There is no 3-star with Node 4 as the central node.

6. For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4.
- There is a 3-star with Node 5 as the central node: <5, (9, 1, 4)>.

7. For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 0.
- There is no 3-star with Node 6 as the central node.

8. For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 0, and 2.
- There is no 3-star with Node 7 as the central node.

9. For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, and 0.
- There is no 3-star with Node 8 as the central node.

10. For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 3, 1, and 7.
- There is no 3-star with Node 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (7, 1, 8)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>.
