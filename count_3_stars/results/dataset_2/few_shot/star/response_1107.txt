Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
