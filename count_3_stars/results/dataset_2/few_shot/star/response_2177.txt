Response:
Let's find the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (0, 10, 17)>
<7, (10, 17, 4)>
<5, (10, 19, 16)>
<13, (5, 15, 14)>
<3, (10, 11, 9)>
<11, (1, 19, 3)>
<19, (11, 18, 2)>
<10, (7, 5, 0)>
<15, (12, 13, 2)>
<8, (16, 19, 5)>
<9, (3)>
<1, (11, 14, 6)>
<6, (1, 2)>
<12, (15, 16, 14)>
<18, (19, 14, 13)>
<0, (4, 10)>
<2, (15, 6, 19)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [17].
