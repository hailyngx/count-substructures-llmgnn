Response:
The 3-star structures can be found by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:

<4, (1, 15, 18)>
<7, (9, 10, 14)>
<14, (7, 16, 19)>
<16, (1, 13, 8)>
<15, (4, 5, 17)>
<18, (4, 11, 9)>
<1, (4, 16, 19)>
<2, (0, 12, 19)>
<5, (15, 19, -)>
<6, (9, 11, -)>
<9, (6, 7, 11)>
<10, (7, 13, 8)>
<11, (6, 18, 13)>
<12, (2, 17, -)>
<17, (12, 15, -)>
<19, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are [15] unique 3-star structures in the given graph.
