Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center. Let's find all such 3-stars:

<0, (7, 6, 15)>
<0, (7, 6, 18)>
<0, (7, 15, 18)>
<0, (6, 15, 18)>
<1, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<1, (4, 13, 11)>
<1, (7, 13, 11)>
<4, (9, 5, 14)>
<4, (9, 5, 1)>
<4, (9, 14, 1)>
<4, (5, 14, 1)>
<8, (13, 19, 10)>
<8, (13, 19, 16)>
<8, (13, 10, 16)>
<13, (12, 9, 19)>
<13, (12, 9, 18)>
<13, (12, 19, 18)>
<13, (9, 19, 18)>
<15, (0, 5, 13)>
<15, (0, 5, 18)>
<15, (0, 13, 18)>
<15, (5, 13, 18)>
<18, (0, 19, 15)>
<18, (0, 19, 12)>
<18, (0, 15, 12)>
<18, (19, 15, 12)>

Thus, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
