Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Now, let's identify and count the 3-stars in the graph:

<14, (17, 27, 28)>
<17, (14, 12, 26)>
<10, (15, 27, 19)>
<27, (14, 29, 21)>
<29, (7, 27, 5)>
<24, (11, 15, 0)>
<12, (6, 9, 21)>
<3, (5, 23, 27)>
<22, (6, 8, 26)>
<21, (25, 27, 12)>
<13, (16, 20, 1)>
<19, (10, 6, 13)>
<0, (11, 24, 28)>
<25, (9, 19, 21)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
