Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since this is a 3-star graph, we are interested in nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

From the adjacency list given, the following nodes have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 8, 11)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 6, 3, 0)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 5, 3, 8)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 8)

We can form the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8, 11)>
<1, (6, 3, 0)>
<13, (5, 3, 8)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
