Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars.

Count of 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 17, 5)>
<1, (3, 10, 19)>
<2, (8, 18, 19)>
<3, (1, 16, 6)>
<5, (13, 0, 16)>
<15, (10, 9, 18)>
<18, (15, 2, 17)>
