Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Next, we will count the occurrences of each unique 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the possible 3-stars:

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 0**:
<0, (4, 13, 5)>
<0, (4, 13, 6)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 2**:
<2, (17, 16, 6)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 3**:
<3, (8, 18, 12)>
<3, (8, 18, 14)>
<3, (8, 12, 14)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 4**:
<4, (8, 9, 5)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 5**:
<5, (4, 0, 10)>
<5, (4, 10, 14)>
<5, (4, 13, 14)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 6**:
<6, (19, 16, 0)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 7**:
<7, (17, 10, 15)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 9**:
<9, (4, 18, 14)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 10**:
<10, (8, 5, 7)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 12**:
<12, (17, 14, 19)>
<12, (17, 9, 19)>
<12, (17, 3, 14)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 13**:
<13, (17, 19, 0)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 16**:
<16, (19, 2, 6)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 17**:
<17, (13, 12, 7)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 18**:
<18, (9, 3, 14)>

Three-star configurations with center node as **node 19**:
<19, (13, 16, 6)>
<19, (13, 16, 12)>
<19, (13, 2, 6)>
<19, (13, 2, 12)>

Now, let's count the occurrences of each unique three-star:

[<0, (4, 13, 5)> <0, (4, 13, 6)> <2, (17, 16, 6)> <3, (8, 18, 12)> <3, (8, 18, 14)> <3, (8, 12, 14)> <4, (8, 9, 5)> <5, (4, 0, 10)> <5, (4, 10, 14)> <5, (4, 13, 14)> <6, (19, 16, 0)> <7, (17, 10, 15)> <9, (4, 18, 14)> <10, (8, 5, 7)> <12, (17, 14, 19)> <12, (17, 9, 19)> <12, (17, 3, 14)> <13, (17, 19, 0)> <16, (19, 2, 6)> <17, (13, 12, 7)> <18, (9, 3, 14)> <19, (13, 16, 6)> <19, (13, 16, 12)> <19, (13, 2, 6)> <19, (13, 2, 12)>]
