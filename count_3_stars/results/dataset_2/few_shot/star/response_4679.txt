Response:
1. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
    - In a 3-star graph, each central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
    - Since there are 15 nodes and each 3-star consists of 4 nodes (1 central node and 3 leaves), we can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:
        Total number of 3-stars = Total nodes - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14

2. Identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    - We will look for 3-stars by checking each node and its connections to see if it forms a 3-star pattern.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (7, 10, 14)>
    - <1, (6, 14, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 9, 5)>
    - <3, (7, 12, 14)>
    - <4, (7, 9, 2)>
    - <5, (0, 13, 2)>
    - <6, (1, 14, 7)>
    - <7, (4, 0, 11)>
    - <8, (10, 12, 0)>
    - <9, (4, 6, 2)>
    - <10, (0, 7, 12)>
    - <11, (0, 13, 7)>
    - <12, (5, 13, 10)>
    - <13, (0, 5, 12)>
    - <14, (1, 6, 3)>
