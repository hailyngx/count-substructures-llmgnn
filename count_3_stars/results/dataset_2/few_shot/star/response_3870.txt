Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes have a degree of exactly 3:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 2, and 11
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 16, 13, and 19
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 5, and 10
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 18, 16, and 14
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 15, 13, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars.
For each of the nodes above, we can form a 3-star with the node itself as the center and each of its neighbors as the leaves.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 2, 11)>
<3, (16, 13, 19)>
<4, (6, 5, 10)>
<7, (18, 16, 14)>
<17, (15, 13, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [5].
