Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's first list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (2, 8, 7)>
<6, (3, 6, 0)>
<7, (9, 8, 4)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (8, 7, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
