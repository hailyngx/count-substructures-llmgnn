Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify patterns where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure. Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information:

Nodes with their connections:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 2, 1, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 6, 3, 0}
- Node 3: {9, 7, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 1}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {2, 0, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {4, 3, 1, 0}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (5, 9, 1)>
- <0, (5, 7, 2)>
- <0, (5, 1, 6)>
- <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- <1, (5, 7, 0)>
- <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- <2, (5, 3, 0)>
- <3, (9, 7, 2)>
- <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- <5, (2, 8, 1)>
- <6, (2, 0, 3)>
- <7, (4, 0, 3)>
- <8, (5, 0, 1)>
  
There are [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
