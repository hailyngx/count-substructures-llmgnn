Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon analyzing the graph, the following nodes meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star:
- Node 1: connected to nodes 6, 3, 5, and 4
- Node 2: connected to nodes 6, 0, and 8
- Node 3: connected to nodes 1, 7, and 0
- Node 5: connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 8: connected to nodes 9, 5, and 2

Let's list the unique 3-star graphs:
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<2, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
