Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These are the nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes that meet this criteria are: 5, 7, 12, and 13. 

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars using these center nodes:
1. For the center node 5: <5, (9, 13, 1)>, <5, (9, 11, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 5)>, <5, (13, 8, 5)>, <5, (13, 4, 3)>, <5, (13, 12, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (11, 3, 5)>, <5, (7, 14, 5)>
2. For the center node 7: <7, (5, 12, 11)>, <7, (5, 11, 3)>, <7, (12, 13, 7)>, <7, (12, 2, 7)>, <7, (11, 3, 7)>, <7, (11, 5, 7)>, <7, (6, 4, 7)>, <7, (6, 14, 7)>
3. For the center node 12: <12, (9, 13, 7)>, <12, (9, 13, 2)>, <12, (13, 5, 7)>, <12, (13, 4, 6)>, <12, (7, 5, 12)>, <12, (7, 11, 12)>, <12, (2, 0, 12)>
4. For the center node 13: <13, (5, 8, 12)>, <13, (5, 4, 3)>, <13, (5, 12, 7)>, <13, (8, 0, 13)>, <13, (4, 6, 13)>, <13, (4, 3, 13)>, <13, (12, 7, 13)>, <13, (12, 2, 13)>, <13, (14, 7, 13)>

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the given graph.
