Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Considering each node as the center of the 3-star:
    - Node 0: (12, 1, 2), (12, 2, 5), (12, 0, 13) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 1: (12, 1, 6), (12, 1, 9), (12, 1, 0) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 2: (12, 2, 5), (12, 2, 9), (12, 2, 3) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 3: (4, 3, 14), (4, 3, 13), (4, 3, 9) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 4: (5, 4, 7) [1 distinct 3-star]
    - Node 5: (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 2), (4, 5, 0) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 6: (7, 6, 14), (7, 6, 13), (7, 6, 1) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 7: (10, 7, 12), (10, 7, 6), (10, 7, 14) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 8: (10, 8, 11), (10, 8, 7) [2 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 9: (10, 9, 1), (10, 9, 2), (10, 9, 3) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 10: (11, 10, 8), (11, 10, 7), (11, 10, 13) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 11: (10, 11, 8) [1 distinct 3-star]
    - Node 12: (7, 12, 2), (7, 12, 0), (7, 12, 1) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 13: (10, 13, 6), (10, 13, 3), (10, 13, 14) [3 distinct 3-stars]
    - Node 14: (7, 14, 6), (7, 14, 3), (7, 14, 13) [3 distinct 3-stars]

2. Summing up the distinct 3-stars found for each center node:
    3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (12, 1, 2)>
<1, (12, 1, 6)>
<2, (12, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 3, 14)>
<4, (5, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (7, 6, 14)>
<7, (10, 7, 12)>
<8, (10, 8, 11)>
<9, (10, 9, 1)>
<10, (11, 10, 8)>
<11, (10, 11, 8)>
<12, (7, 12, 2)>
<13, (10, 13, 6)>
<14, (7, 14, 6)>
