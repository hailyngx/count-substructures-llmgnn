Response:
There are several 3-stars in the graph you provided. Let's find them step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 23, and 17. So, the 3-star centered at node 5 is <5, (9, 23, 17)>.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 22, and 18. So, the 3-star centered at node 9 is <9, (5, 22, 18)>.
3. Node 20 is connected to nodes 25, 13, and 0. So, the 3-star centered at node 20 is <20, (25, 13, 0)>.
4. Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 26, and 15. So, the 3-star centered at node 25 is <25, (20, 26, 15)>.
5. Node 28 is connected to nodes 9, 29, and 4. So, the 3-star centered at node 28 is <28, (9, 29, 4)>.
6. Node 29 is connected to nodes 28, 19, and 13. So, the 3-star centered at node 29 is <29, (28, 19, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
