Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 8, and 5.
   - This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 4, 3, and 8 as the leaves. <0, (4, 3, 8)>
   - Similarly, this also forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 4, 8, and 5 as the leaves. <0, (4, 8, 5)>
   - Finally, this forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 3, 8, and 5 as the leaves. <0, (3, 8, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 9.
   - This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 7, 5, and 9 as the leaves. <1, (7, 5, 9)>

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 8.
   - This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 3, 9, and 8 as the leaves. <2, (3, 9, 8)>

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 3 since it has more than three connections.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 0, and 6.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 4 since it has more than three connections.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 3, 2, and 0.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 5 since it has more than three connections.

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is only connected to nodes 4.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 6 since it has less than three connections.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 5, and 1.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 7 since it has more than three connections.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 9, 2, and 0.
   - No 3-stars are formed around node 8 since it has more than three connections.

10. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 8, and 2.
    - No 3-stars are formed around node 9 since it has more than three connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] as we found 4 unique 3-stars.
