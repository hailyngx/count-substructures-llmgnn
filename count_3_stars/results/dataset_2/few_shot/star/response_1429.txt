Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that a 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <0, (8, 10, 3)>
2. <1, (9, 8, 5)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 5)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 13)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 12)>
6. <5, (8, 2, 1)>
7. <6, (14, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 3, 10)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 5)>
10. <9, (8, 1)>
11. <10, (4, 7, 0)>
12. <11, (4, 5)>
13. <12, (4, 10, 14)>
14. <13, (7, 3)>
15. <14, (6, 12, 11)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
