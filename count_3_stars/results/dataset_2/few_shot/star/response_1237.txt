Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like shape.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 5: (1, 8, 0) - It forms a 3-star with central node 5 and leaves 1, 8, and 0.
- Node 9: (2, 4, 3) - It forms a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 2, 4, and 3.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<9, (2, 4, 3)>
