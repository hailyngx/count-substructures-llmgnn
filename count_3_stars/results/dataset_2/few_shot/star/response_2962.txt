Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph are nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph based on the adjacency list.

Based on the adjacency list provided:
- Node 5 is connected to 1 neighbor.
- Node 12 is connected to 1 neighbor.
- Node 15 is connected to 1 neighbor.
- Node 25 is connected to 1 neighbor.
- Node 28 is connected to 1 neighbor.
- Node 29 is connected to 1 neighbor.

Now, let's focus on the remaining nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars. The remaining nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 10
- Node 14
- Node 20
- Node 23
- Node 24

Let's check for each of these nodes if they form a 3-star with their neighbors:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 23.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 25, and 26.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 22, and 28.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 20, and 21.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 14, and 21.
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 26, and 27.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (2, 6, 23)>
<7, (2, 25, 26)>
<10, (18, 22, 28)>
<14, (16, 20, 21)>
<20, (3, 14, 21)>
<23, (0, 4, 6)>
<24, (22, 26, 27)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
