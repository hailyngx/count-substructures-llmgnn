Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the adjacency list to identify these 3-star structures.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly three connections are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 2.
- Node 7: Connected to node 18.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 13, 10, and 13.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3 and 20.
- Node 11: Connected to node 21.
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 16 and 5.
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 20, 16, and 24.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:
<1, (2, 5, 2)>
<8, (13, 10, 13)>
<21, (16, 5, 16)>
<22, (20, 16, 24)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
