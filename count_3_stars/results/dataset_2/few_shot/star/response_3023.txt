Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the triangles, which are complete subgraphs of size 3.

The triangles in the graph are:
<4, 8, 2>
<4, 9, 10>
<5, 11, 1>
<3, 7, 6>
<0, 9, 10>
<5, 13, 12>
<2, 6, 14>
<7, 5, 14>

Now, for each triangle, we need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star can be formed by selecting one node as the central node and the other two nodes as leaves.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<4, (8, 9, 10)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<2, (8, 12, 6)>
<3, (11, 7, 6)>
<0, (9, 10, 7)>
<5, (11, 13, 12)>
<6, (4, 2, 14)>
<7, (3, 5, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<10, (9, 2, 13)>
<11, (3, 1, 5)>
<12, (10, 13, 5)>
<13, (5, 12, 10)>
<14, (2, 7, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are 14 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [14].
