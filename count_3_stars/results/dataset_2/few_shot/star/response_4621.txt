Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars:
<2, (29, 3, 4)>
<3, (29, 26, 23)>
<4, (29, 3, 25)>
<5, (23, 27, 5)>
<6, (0, 14, 25)>
<7, (11, 13, 24)>
<8, (9, 12, 22)>
<9, (27, 12, 18)>
<10, (16, 13, 1)>
<11, (23, 28, 7)>
<12, (0, 21, 8)>
<13, (10, 11, 1)>
<14, (6, 15, 0)>
<15, (14, 6, 25)>
<16, (10, 20, 25)>
<17, (26, 21, 27)>
<18, (19, 9, 27)>
<19, (2, 18, 26)>
<20, (22, 16, 25)>
<21, (17, 12, 25)>
<22, (20, 8, 16)>
<23, (11, 29, 3)>
<24, (7, 28, 11)>
<25, (21, 0, 4)>
<26, (28, 19, 17)>
<27, (5, 17, 9)>
<28, (24, 11, 26)>
<29, (2, 4, 23)>

There are [29] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
