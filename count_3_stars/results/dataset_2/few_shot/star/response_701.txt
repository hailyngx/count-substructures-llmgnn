Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
