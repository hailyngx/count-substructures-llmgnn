Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can determine which nodes are directly connected to each node. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 19, 28)>
<2, (1, 19, 22)>
<3, (13, 14, 18)>
<4, (5, 6, 15)>
<5, (4, 6, 24)>
<6, (4, 5, 20)>
<8, (4, 12, 28)>
<10, (11, 12, 17)>
<11, (10, 13, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 18)>
<13, (3, 10, 11)>
<14, (3, 20, 29)>
<15, (4, 27, 19)>
<16, (7, 26, 28)>
<17, (10, 29, 11)>
<18, (3, 6, 21)>
<19, (0, 1, 24)>
<20, (0, 6, 14)>
<22, (1, 19, 21)>
<24, (5, 19, 25)>
<27, (9, 15, 19)>
<28, (1, 7, 8)>
<29, (8, 14, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
