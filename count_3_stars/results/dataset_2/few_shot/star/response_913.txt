Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 12, and node 4

Node 3 is connected to node 14, 2, 12, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 3, 9, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 14, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 14, 12, 7, and node 4
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 7, 0, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 3, 8, 9, and node 13

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node and summing them up. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars around each node: 

Around Node 0: None
Around Node 1: None
Around Node 2: None
Around Node 3: None
Around Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 1)>
Around Node 5: None
Around Node 6: None
Around Node 7: None
Around Node 8: None
Around Node 9: <9, (14, 12, 4)>
Around Node 10: None
Around Node 11: None
Around Node 12: None
Around Node 13: None
Around Node 14: None

Adding these up, we get a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph: <4, (2, 3, 1)> and <9, (14, 12, 4)>.
