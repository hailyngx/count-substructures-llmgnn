Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step by step:

1. Consider each node in the graph as the potential center of a 3-star.
2. Check if the node has exactly three neighbors connected to it. If it does, then it forms a 3-star.
3. List all unique 3-stars found.

Based on the provided information, let's start identifying the 3-stars:

<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
