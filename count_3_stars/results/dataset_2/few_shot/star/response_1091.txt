Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list and the edges provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<9, (2, 7, 13)>
<26, (1, 28, 14)>
<3, (28, 24, 16)>
<15, (23, 0, 14)>
<1, (26, 21, 20)>
<0, (15, 27, 18)>
<27, (0, 2, 16)>
<21, (1, 20, 5)>
<22, (21, 25, 4)>
<10, (6, 29, 5)>
<17, (28, 25, 12)>
<14, (26, 15, 23)>
<16, (3, 27, 18)>
<12, (17, 6, 25)>
<5, (21, 10, 22)>
<18, (0, 16, 7)>
<19, (1)>
<20, (1)>
<24, (3, 28, 5)>
<23, (9, 15, 14)>
<11, (25, 2)>
<29, (10, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
