Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2)

Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the number of 3-stars.

1. Node 0: Possible 3-stars involving node 0 are:
   - <0, (6, 9, 7)>
   - <0, (6, 9, 8)>
   [2 possible 3-stars]

2. Node 1: Possible 3-stars involving node 1 are:
   - <1, (6, 9, 2)>
   - <1, (6, 9, 5)>
   [2 possible 3-stars]

3. Node 2: Possible 3-stars involving node 2 are:
   - <2, (9, 1, 5)>
   [1 possible 3-star]

4. Node 3: Possible 3-stars involving node 3 are:
   - <3, (9, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (9, 5, 7)>
   [2 possible 3-stars]

5. Node 4: Possible 3-stars involving node 4 are:
   - <4, (6, 9, 7)>
   - <4, (6, 9, 3)>
   [2 possible 3-stars]

6. Node 5: Possible 3-stars involving node 5 are:
   - <5, (1, 3, 2)>
   [1 possible 3-star]

7. Node 6: Possible 3-stars involving node 6 are:
   - <6, (9, 1, 7)>
   - <6, (9, 4, 7)>
   - <6, (9, 7, 8)>
   [3 possible 3-stars]

8. Node 7: Possible 3-stars involving node 7 are:
   - <7, (6, 4, 0)>
   - <7, (6, 4, 3)>
   [2 possible 3-stars]

9. Node 8: Node 8 has only two connections, so no 3-stars can be formed with this node.

10. Node 9: Possible 3-stars involving node 9 are:
    - <9, (6, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 1, 2)>
    [2 possible 3-stars]

Summing up the possible unique 3-stars from each node gives:
[2 (from node 0) + 2 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 2 (from node 3) + 2 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 3 (from node 6) + 2 (from node 7) + 2 (from node 9) = 17]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
