Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can deduce the following 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 9, 13)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 14)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<3, (8, 12, 18)>
<4, (0, 8, 14)>
<5, (3, 10, 18)>
<7, (2, 12, 14)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 14, 18)>
<9, (1, 12, 14)>
<10, (5, 17, 3)>
<11, (16, 17, 18)>
<12, (2, 3, 7)>
<13, (0, 17, 9)>
<14, (2, 8, 9)>
<15, (19)>
<16, (11, 7, 19)>
<17, (10, 11, 13)>
<18, (3, 11, 19)>
<19, (15, 16, 18)>
