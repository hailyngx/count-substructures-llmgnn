Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph and count them.

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- For node 3: <3, (1, 10, 18)>
- For node 15: <15, (3, 7, 0)>
- For node 1: <1, (3, 6, 11)>
- For node 5: <5, (6, 12, 10)>
- For node 6: <6, (1, 5, 10)>
- For node 10: <10, (3, 5, 4)>
- For node 14: <14, (13, 11, 4)>
- For node 17: <17, (2, 12, 4)>
- For node 18: <18, (3, 12, 12)>
- For node 19: <19, (13, 7, 0)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars mentioned above gives us a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
