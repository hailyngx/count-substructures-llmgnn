Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find every instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. Node 5: <5, (6, 2, 15)>
2. Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 4)>
3. Node 12: <12, (8, 4, 15)>
4. Node 15: <15, (5, 12, 18)>
5. Node 18: <18, (8, 16, 19)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
