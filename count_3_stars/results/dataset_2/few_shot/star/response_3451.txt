Response:
There are [20] nodes and [60] edges in the given graph.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (17, 10, 15)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 12)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 13)>
4. <4, (7, 2, 12)>
5. <6, (12, 14, 0)>
6. <7, (15, 4, 10)>
7. <10, (13, 1, 7)>
8. <11, (19, 12, 13)>
9. <12, (4, 1, 11)>
10. <14, (6, 18, 16)>
11. <15, (7, 1, 16)>
12. <18, (5, 15, 14)>
13. <19, (4, 11, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
