Response:
The 3-star graph can be created by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-star configurations:

<0, (6, 2, 12)>
<1, (17, 13, 16)>
<2, (0, 7, 2)>
<3, (11, 10, 16)>
<4, (3, 19, 13)>
<5, (19, 8, 12)>
<6, (12, 0, 13)>
<7, (14, 18, 16)>
<8, (5, 3, 8)>
<9, (18, 9, 17)>
<10, (3)>
<11, (3, 15, 15)>
<12, (6, 5, 1)>
<13, (6, 1, 4)>
<14, (7, 19, 14)>
<15, (11, 17, 15)>
<16, (3, 4, 7)>
<17, (9, 5, 1)>
<18, (9, 18, 7)>
<19, (5, 14, 4)>

Based on the given configurations, we have a total of [19] unique 3-star structures.
