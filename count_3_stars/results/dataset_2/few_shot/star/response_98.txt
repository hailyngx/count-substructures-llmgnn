Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 2, 3, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 7, 12, 8, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 13, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 10, 3, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 11, 13, 0, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 0, 2, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that fit the criteria of a center of a 3-star are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 12, 2, and 13)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 11, 8, and 12)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 9 and 14)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (12, 2, 13)>
<1, (11, 8, 12)>
<4, (9, 14, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [3].
