Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 

<1, (3, 7, 19)>
<2, (4, 9, 18)>
<3, (1, 5, 17)>
<4, (2, 9, 18)>
<5, (3, 8, 15)>
<6, (8, 13, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 17)>
<8, (5, 6, 15)>
<9, (2, 4, 18)>
<10, (6, 12, 15)>
<11, (0, 17, 18)>
<12, (10, 14, 15)>
<13, (0, 6, 16)>
<14, (6, 12, 19)>
<15, (5, 12, 19)>
<16, (13, 18, 0)>
<17, (1, 11, 15)>
<18, (2, 4, 16)>
<19, (1, 14, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
