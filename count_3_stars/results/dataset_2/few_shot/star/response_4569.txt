Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<2, (16, 10, 8)>
<3, (15, 19, 18)>
<4, (7, 19, 0)>
<8, (11, 16, 10)>
<9, (16, 13, 19)>
<11, (18, 10, 8)>
<13, (6, 9, 14)>
<14, (17, 7, 12)>
<15, (3, 19, 18)>
<16, (8, 2, 10)>
<17, (14, 0, 5)>
<18, (11, 15, 17)>
<19, (4, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
