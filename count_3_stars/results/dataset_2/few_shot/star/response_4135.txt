Response:
Okay, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 9, 12, and 25.
   - Node 28 is connected to nodes 13, 29, 10, and 23.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 18, 19, and 25.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 29, and 26.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 1, and 27.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 17, and 19.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 28, 29, 2, and 12.
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 23, 7, and 14.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 27, and 24.
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 27, 5, and 14.
   - Node 20 is connected to nodes 0, 26, 23, and 11.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - Let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each possible 3-star by considering each node as the center.

3. Compute the total number of 3-stars:   
   - The total number of 3-stars is [5].

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<22, (13, 9, 12)>
<2, (4, 18, 25)>
<4, (8, 2, 29)>
<15, (23, 7, 14)>
<19, (2, 27, 5)>
