Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 5)>
<2, (9, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (3, 0, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13].
