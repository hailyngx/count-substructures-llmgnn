Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

The possible 3-stars can be formed by selecting a central node and its three connected nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars:  
<1, (6, 7, 27)>  
<2, (6, 10, 27)>  
<3, (14, 15, 21)>  
<4, (5, 12, 13)>  
<5, (4, 8, 23)>  
<6, (1, 2, 26)>  
<7, (1, 9, 16)>  
<9, (7, 10, 16)>  
<10, (0, 2, 9)>  
<11, (14, 15, 28)>  
<12, (2, 13, 17)>  
<15, (0, 11, 21)>  
<16, (7, 9, 16)>  
<17, (12, 18, 25)>  
<18, (17, 25, 27)>  
<19, (0, 20, 27)>  
<20, (6, 19, 24)>  
<21, (3, 15, 29)>  
<22, (12, 15, 22)>  
<23, (0, 5, 24)>  
<24, (20, 23, 24)>  
<25, (18, 25, 27)>  
<26, (6, 21, 29)>  
<27, (1, 25, 27)>  
<29, (9, 21, 26)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
