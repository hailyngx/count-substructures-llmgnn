Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (9, 4, 6)>
   - 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (9, 1, 8)>
   - 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 6, 3)>
   - 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 2, 3)>
   - 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 2, 3)>
   
2. Node 1:
   - No 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.

3. Node 2:
   - 3-star with Node 2 as the center: <2, (9, 4, 7)>
   - 3-star with Node 2 as the center: <2, (9, 6, 7)>
   
4. Node 3:
   - No 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.

5. Node 4:
   - 3-star with Node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 6, 2)>
   
6. Node 5:
   - No 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.

7. Node 6:
   - 3-star with Node 6 as the center: <6, (9, 4, 7)>
   
8. Node 7:
   - No 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
   
9. Node 8:
   - No 3-stars with Node 8 as the center.

10. Node 9:
   - No 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (9, 4, 6)>, <0, (9, 1, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 3)>, <0, (4, 2, 3)>, <0, (6, 2, 3)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, and <4, (7, 6, 2)>.
