Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all the 3-stars first. 

<0, (14, 7, 2)>
<1, (7, 4, 12)>
<2, (17, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 11, 16)>
<4, (17, 12, 1)>
<5, (14, 8, 3)>
<6, (17, 10, 3)>
<7, (0, 16, 1)>
<8, (2, 5, 11)>
<10, (6, 15, 18)>
<11, (8, 3, 19)>
<12, (9, 4, 1)>
<13, (3, 5)>
<14, (17, 0, 5)>
<15, (10, 18, 16)>
<16, (3, 7, 15)>
<17, (6, 14, 2)>
<18, (10, 15, 19)>
<19, (11, 18)>

Now we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph. By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found that there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
