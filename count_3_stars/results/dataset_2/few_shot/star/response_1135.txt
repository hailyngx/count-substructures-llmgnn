Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Find all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (less than 3).
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 20 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 23 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors (more than 3).
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors (exactly 3).

2. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- <16, (11, 25, 10)>
- <11, (16, 25, 6)>
- <26, (29, 0, 12)>
- <0, (26, 28, 9)>
- <15, (19, 25, 8)>
- <8, (15, 9, 17)>
- <9, (8, 0, 23)>
- <10, (16, 24, 3)>
- <12, (26, 24, 17)>
- <29, (26, 7, 13)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   
- [9]

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [9]
