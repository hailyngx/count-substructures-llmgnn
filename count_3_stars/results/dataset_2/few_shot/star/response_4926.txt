Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Observing the adjacency list, we can see that the following 3-stars exist:
1. Node 0 is the center connected to nodes 5, 7, and 12. (<0, (5, 7, 12)>)
2. Node 1 is the center connected to nodes 5, 11, and 14. (<1, (5, 11, 14)>)
3. Node 3 is the center connected to nodes 0, 10, and 12. (<3, (0, 10, 12)>)
4. Node 4 is the center connected to nodes 2, 5, and 11. (<4, (2, 5, 11)>)
5. Node 6 is the center connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9. (<6, (2, 3, 9)>)
6. Node 7 is the center connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. (<7, (0, 8, 9)>)
7. Node 8 is the center connected to nodes 5, 7, and 14. (<8, (5, 7, 14)>)
8. Node 9 is the center connected to nodes 6, 7, and 14. (<9, (6, 7, 14)>)
9. Node 10 is the center connected to nodes 3, 5, and 14. (<10, (3, 5, 14)>)
10. Node 11 is the center connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. (<11, (1, 4, 9)>)
11. Node 12 is the center connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3. (<12, (0, 1, 3)>)
12. Node 13 is the center connected to nodes 6, 10, and 14. (<13, (6, 10, 14)>)
13. Node 14 is the center connected to nodes 1, 9, and 13. (<14, (1, 9, 13)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
