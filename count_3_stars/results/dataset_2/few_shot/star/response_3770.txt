Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2)

Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can start by checking each node and its connections:

- For Node 0, it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. So, a 3-star centered at Node 0 is <0, (5, 9, 1)>.
- For Node 1, it is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 8. So, a 3-star centered at Node 1 is <1, (6, 0, 8)>.
- For Node 2, it is connected to nodes 6 and 0. Since it does not form a 3-star, we skip Node 2.
- For Node 3, it is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0. So, a 3-star centered at Node 3 is <3, (5, 7, 0)>.
- For Node 4, it is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8. So, a 3-star centered at Node 4 is <4, (3, 7, 8)>.
- For Node 5, it is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 0. So, a 3-star centered at Node 5 is <5, (6, 8, 0)>.
- For Node 6, it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. So, a 3-star centered at Node 6 is <6, (5, 9, 1)>.
- For Node 7, it is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3. So, a 3-star centered at Node 7 is <7, (9, 1, 3)>.
- For Node 8, it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6. So, a 3-star centered at Node 8 is <8, (5, 9, 6)>.
- For Node 9, it is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7. So, a 3-star centered at Node 9 is <9, (6, 8, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
