Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given information, the 3-star patterns in this graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 3, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 2, 6)>
<5, (8, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
