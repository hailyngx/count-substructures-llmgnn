Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. We will then list unique 3-stars that we find. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 12), <0, (5, 1, 13)> [3-stars: 3]
2. Node 1: (1, 5, 10), (1, 5, 14), <1, (5, 0, 8)> [3-stars: 2]
3. Node 2: (2, 9, 11), (2, 9, 3), <2, (9, 8, 12)> [3-stars: 2]
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 8), (3, 2, 12), <3, (2, 8, 4)>, <3, (8, 12, 4)> [3-stars: 3]
5. Node 4: (4, 14, 3) [3-stars: 1]
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 10), <5, (1, 0, 8)> [3-stars: 2]
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 7), <6, (5, 0, 12)> [3-stars: 2]
8. Node 7: (7, 11, 6), (7, 11, 12), <7, (11, 8, 13)>, <7, (8, 12, 13)> [3-stars: 3]
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 7), (8, 2, 3), <8, (2, 9, 12)> [3-stars: 2]
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 12) [3-stars: 1]
11. Node 10: (10, 1, 13) [3-stars: 1]
12. Node 11: (11, 7, 14), <11, (7, 8, 13)> [3-stars: 2]
13. Node 12: (12, 9, 6), <12, (9, 8, 7)>, <12, (8, 7, 3)> [3-stars: 3]
14. Node 13: (13, 10, 0), <13, (10, 1, 14)>, <13, (0, 1, 7)> [3-stars: 3]
15. Node 14: (14, 11, 4), <14, (11, 1, 13)> [3-stars: 2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
