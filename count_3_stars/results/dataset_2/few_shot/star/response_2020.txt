Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Based on the adjacency list, it's clear that the possible central nodes are 1, 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 25, and 29. 
- We will then check each central node to find its 3-star configurations.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (7, 9, 23)>
<3, (8, 19, 26)>
<8, (13, 16, 29)>
<12, (13, 17, 27)>
<13, (8, 12, 29)>
<14, (4, 5, 27)>
<16, (13, 20, 28)>
<19, (3, 21, 26)>
<20, (16, 25, 18)>
<21, (15, 19, 7)>
<25, (6, 7, 12)>
<29, (18, 13, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [12].
