Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:
<0, (6, 11, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<3, (11, 7, 12)> 
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 13)>
<7, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 10, 9)>
<10, (4, 12, 10)>
<11, (5, 7, 11)>
<12, (3, 2, 12)>
<13, (6, 2, 13)>
<14, (11, 7, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
