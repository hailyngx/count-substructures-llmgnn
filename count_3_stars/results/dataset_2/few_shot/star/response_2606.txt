Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <2, (15, 10, 5)>
2. <3, (15, 7, 17)>
3. <4, (13, 18, 1)>
4. <5, (13, 2, 14)>
5. <6, (16, 7, 12)>
6. <7, (3, 10, 6)>
7. <8, (13, 18, 8)>
8. <9, (15, 17, 9)>
9. <10, (0, 7, 2)>
10. <11, (16, 0, 15)>
11. <12, (6, 19, 12)>
12. <13, (8, 5, 4)>
13. <14, (18, 5, 19)>
14. <15, (11, 3, 1)>
15. <16, (11, 1, 6)>
16. <17, (3, 4, 9)>
17. <18, (8, 4, 14)>
18. <19, (13, 14, 12)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [18]
