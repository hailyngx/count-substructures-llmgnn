Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. So, <5, (9, 6, 8)> forms a 3-star.
2. Similarly, Node 9 has connections to nodes 5, 1, and 0, forming <9, (5, 1, 0)>.
3. Node 1 has edges to nodes 9, 3, and 11, forming <1, (9, 3, 11)>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 8, forming <4, (1, 11, 8)>.
5. Node 2 has connections to nodes 4, 8, and 13, forming <2, (4, 8, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
