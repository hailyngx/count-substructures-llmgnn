Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 8, and 17.
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 7, and 0.
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 12, and 2.
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 11, and 18.
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 11, and 13.
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 10.
7. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 19.
8. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 7, and 19.
9. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 0.
10. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 17.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (15, 8, 17)>
<3, (15, 7, 0)>
<4, (8, 12, 2)>
<5, (19, 11, 18)>
<6, (16, 11, 13)>
<9, (14, 1, 10)>
<10, (9, 4, 19)>
<11, (8, 7, 19)>
<15, (3, 7, 0)>
<18, (5, 10, 17)>
