Response:
First, we identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list given, we can find the following 3-stars: 
<5, (1, 29, 0)>
<7, (16, 3, 23)>
<13, (17, 24, 0)>
<16, (28, 1, 7)>
<19, (12, 6, 8)>
<24, (13, 9, 18)>
<25, (27, 28, 8)>
<26, (28, 29, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 
[8]
