Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in the adjacency list:
   - Node 0: (7, 11, 8, 3)
   - Node 1: (4, 7, 10, 13, 2)
   - Node 2: (11, 5, 12, 1)
   - Node 3: (4, 7, 5, 0, 14)
   - Node 4: (7, 1, 3)
   - Node 5: (6, 7, 10, 2, 3)
   - Node 6: (9, 5, 12, 8)
   - Node 7: (4, 0, 3, 5, 1)
   - Node 8: (6, 9, 13, 0, 12)
   - Node 9: (6, 8)
   - Node 10: (12, 1, 13, 5)
   - Node 11: (0, 2)
   - Node 12: (6, 10, 8, 13, 2)
   - Node 13: (10, 8, 12, 1, 14)
   - Node 14: (13, 3)

2. Consider each node as the potential central node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes connected to it.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are as follows:
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 12, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, -)>
<10, (1, 5, 13)>
<12, (2, 10, 8)>
<13, (1, 14, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
