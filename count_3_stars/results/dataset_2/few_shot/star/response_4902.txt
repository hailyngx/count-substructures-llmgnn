Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
We will analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars present in it. 

Let's start by checking each node and its neighbors. A 3-star can be formed if a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

From the information provided and the definitions of a 3-star graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <5, (9, 6, 4)>
- <9, (5, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
