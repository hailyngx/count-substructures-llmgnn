Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star.

Given the adjacency list:
- Node 0: 5, 2, 1
- Node 1: 5, 7, 6, 2, 0
- Node 2: 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 9, 4, 7, 2
- Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 7, 1
- Node 7: 4, 3, 6, 2, 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 5, 4, 2, 3

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 0: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 6)>
- Node 2: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- Node 6: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: None (Doesn't have 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 7, 6)> and <4, (5, 9, 7)>.
