Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can observe that the nodes {1, 3, 5} form a 3-star with the central node 1 and leaves 3 and 5.
- Similarly, the nodes {3, 8, 10} form another 3-star with the central node 3 and leaves 8 and 10.
- The nodes {4, 8, 14} form a 3-star with the central node 8 and leaves 4 and 14.
- The nodes {6, 7, 13} form a 3-star with the central node 6 and leaves 7 and 13.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 5)> 
<3, (8, 10)> 
<4, (8, 14)> 
<6, (7, 13)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
