Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars around each node.

Let's count the 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: None
- Node 1: (1, 9, 13) -> <1, (9, 8, 6)>
- Node 2: None
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: (5, 9, 18) -> <5, (9, 14, 18)>
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: (8, 9, 15) -> <8, (9, 1, 15)>
- Node 9: (9, 8, 16) and (9, 5, 1) -> <9, (8, 16, 1)> and <9, (5, 18, 1)>
- Node 10: None
- Node 11: (11, 7, 19) -> <11, (7, 19, 2)>
- Node 12: None
- Node 13: None
- Node 14: None
- Node 15: (15, 7, 16) -> <15, (7, 16, 14)>
- Node 16: None
- Node 17: None
- Node 18: None
- Node 19: None

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<5, (9, 14, 18)>
<8, (9, 1, 15)>
<9, (8, 16, 1)>
<9, (5, 18, 1)>
<11, (7, 19, 2)>
<15, (7, 16, 14)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
