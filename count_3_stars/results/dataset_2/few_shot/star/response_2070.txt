Response:
To count the number of 3-stars present in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the possible 3-stars based on the given edges and adjacency list:
   
   - Possible 3-star configurations based on the edges:
     - (11, 16, 3) - Central node: 11
     - (8, 13, 17) - Central node: 8
     - (4, 8, 1) - Central node: 4
     - (2, 11, 19) - Central node: 2
     - (0, 7, 6) - Central node: 0
     - (7, 10, 5) - Central node: 7
     - (19, 12, 9) - Central node: 19

2. Let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
   
<11, (16, 3, 2)>
<8, (13, 17, 4)>
<2, (11, 19, 3)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<7, (10, 5, 0)>
<19, (12, 9, 18)>

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:
