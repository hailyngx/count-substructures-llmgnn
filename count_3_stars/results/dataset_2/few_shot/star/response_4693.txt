Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If it is, then those nodes form a 3-star with the current node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (8, 11, 10)>
<4, (5, 12, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 13)>
<14, (9, 8, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
