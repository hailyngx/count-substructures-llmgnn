Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do that looking for each central node in the graph.

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (9, 11, 14)>
<1, (13, 7, 14)>
<2, (9, 11, 13)>
<3, (9, 8, 5)>
<4, (6, 12, *)>
<5, (6, 10, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 14)>
<7, (12, 3, 2)>
<8, (6, 5, 14)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<10, (6, 13, 5)>
<11, (0, 2, *)>
<12, (7, 4, 2)>
<13, (9, 10, 2)>
<14, (6, 10, 8)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. We can see there are 14 unique instances. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
