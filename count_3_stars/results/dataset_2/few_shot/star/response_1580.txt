Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Let's start by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

- For Node 11: <11, (16, 7, 0)>
- For Node 16: <16, (11, 1, 19)>
- For Node 7: <7, (11, 12, 13)>
- For Node 0: <0, (11, 14, 8)>
- For Node 14: <14, (13, 0, 11)>
- For Node 8: <8, (0, 9, 5)>
- For Node 9: <9, (12, 8, 15)>
- For Node 12: <12, (7, 4, 9)>
- For Node 10: No 3-star
- For Node 15: <15, (9, 10, 18)>
- For Node 4: No 3-star
- For Node 1: No 3-star
- For Node 6: <6, (15, 17, 2)>
- For Node 2: No 3-star
- For Node 3: No 3-star
- For Node 5: No 3-star
- For Node 17: <17, (9, 6, 19)>
- For Node 18: No 3-star
- For Node 19: <19, (16, 17, 3)>
- For Node 13: <13, (11, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:

<11, (16, 7, 0)>
<16, (11, 1, 19)>
<7, (11, 12, 13)>
<0, (11, 14, 8)>
<14, (13, 0, 11)>
<8, (0, 9, 5)>
<9, (12, 8, 15)>
<12, (7, 4, 9)>
<15, (9, 10, 18)>
<6, (15, 17, 2)>
<17, (9, 6, 19)>
<19, (16, 17, 3)>
<13, (11, 7, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [(13)] 3-stars in the given graph.
