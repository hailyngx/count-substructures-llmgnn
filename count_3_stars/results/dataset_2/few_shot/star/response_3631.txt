Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 2.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 8.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 9.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 5 is not a part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 8.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (7, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
