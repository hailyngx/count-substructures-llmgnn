Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by identifying the nodes which form 3-stars in the graph by checking all the nodes and their connections.

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 14, and 5. 
Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 25, and 19.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 24, and 17.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 12, and 28.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 20, and 28.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 21, and 27.
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 12, and 10.
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 22, and 20.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 2, and 19.
Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 6, and 7.
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 17, and 25.
Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 21.
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 24, and 17.
Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 28.
Node 15 does not form a 3-star.
Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 4, and 20.
Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 24, and 13.
Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 22, and 29.
Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 25, and 9.
Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 8, and 3.
Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 10.
Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 28 and 1.
Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 29, and 5.
Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 3, and 17.
Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 2, and 18.
Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 8, and 6.
Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 6, and 21.
Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 22, and 3.
Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 18, and 23.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (7, 14, 5)>
<2, (9, 25, 19)>
<3, (28, 24, 17)>
<4, (16, 12, 28)>
<5, (14, 20, 28)>
<6, (26, 21, 27)>
<7, (21, 12, 10)>
<8, (26, 22, 20)>
<9, (25, 2, 19)>
<11, (19, 17, 25)>
<12, (4, 7, 21)>
<13, (3, 24, 17)>
<16, (23, 4, 20)>
<18, (21, 22, 29)>
<19, (11, 25, 9)>
<20, (16, 8, 3)>
<21, (7, 6, 10)>
<22, (18, 28, 1)>
<23, (16, 29, 5)>
<24, (8, 3, 17)>
<25, (19, 2, 18)>
<26, (15, 8, 6)>
<27, (29, 6, 21)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [24].
