Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 2, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<0, (7, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
