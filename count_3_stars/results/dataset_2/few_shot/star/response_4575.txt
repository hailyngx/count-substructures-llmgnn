Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<3, (5, 0, 4)>
<4, (5, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
