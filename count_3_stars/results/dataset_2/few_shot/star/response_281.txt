Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph: 

1. <6, (9, 2, 4)>
2. <9, (6, 4, 0)>
3. <3, (6, 1, 7)>
4. <4, (6, 9, 7)>
5. <8, (6, 1, 5)>
6. <0, (6, 9, 3)>
7. <2, (6, 9, 5)>
8. <5, (1, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
