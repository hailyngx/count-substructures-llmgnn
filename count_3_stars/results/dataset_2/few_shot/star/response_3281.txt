Response:
Let's start by identifying 3-stars in the given graph.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
We will go through each node and check if it is a part of any 3-star, and then count the total number of 3-stars at the end.

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 1). No 3-star.

2. Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 4), (1, 0). <1, (8, 7, 12)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 2: (2, 8), (2, 11), (2, 14). No 3-star.

4. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 7). No 3-star.

5. Node 4: (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 12), (4, 0), (4, 14), (4, 1). <4, (10, 5, 12)> is a 3-star.

6. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 11), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 14). <5, (6, 13, 11)>, <5, (4, 0, 14)> are 3-stars.

7. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 3). No 3-star.

8. Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 1). No 3-star.

9. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 1). <8, (9, 13, 2)> is a 3-star.

10. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 13). No 3-star.

11. Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 4). No 3-star.

12. Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 5), (11, 2). No 3-star.

13. Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 14), (12, 1). No 3-star.

14. Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 5). No 3-star.

15. Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 5), (14, 2), (14, 12), (14, 4). No 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 3
[3]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (8, 7, 12)>
<4, (10, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 13, 11)>
<5, (4, 0, 14)>
