Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that the center node 0 has neighbors 17, 22, 21, 28, and 29. The triangles here are (0, 17, 22), (0, 21, 28), and (0, 21, 29).
- Similarly, the triangles involving center node 2 are (2, 13, 26) and (2, 6, 1).
- For center node 3, the triangle is (3, 9, 21).
- For center node 4, the triangle is (4, 26, 18).
- For center node 5, the triangle is (5, 25, 14).
- For center node 6, the triangle is (6, 2, 13).
- For center node 7, the triangle is (7, 26, 18).
- For center node 9, the triangle is (9, 22, 18).
- For center node 10, the triangle is (10, 22, 27).
- For center node 11, the triangle is (11, 2, 13).
- For center node 14, the triangle is (14, 17, 0).
- For center node 15, the triangle is (15, 22, 23).
- For center node 18, the triangle is (18, 22, 10).
- For center node 20, the triangle is (20, 28, 0).
- For center node 21, the triangle is (21, 29, 0).
- For center node 26, the triangle is (26, 18, 22).
- For center node 27, the triangle is (27, 8, 14).
- For center node 28, the triangle is (28, 0, 17).
- For center node 29, the triangle is (29, 12, 21).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 22, 21)>, <0, (21, 28, 29)>, <2, (13, 26, 6)>, <3, (9, 21, 7)>, <4, (26, 18, 10)>, <5, (25, 14, 10)>, <6, (13, 2, 1)>, <7, (26, 18, 3)>, <9, (22, 18, 10)>, <10, (22, 27, 5)>, <11, (2, 13, 6)>, <14, (17, 0, 25)>, <15, (22, 23, 6)>, <18, (22, 10, 26)>, <20, (28, 0, 24)>, <21, (29, 0, 12)>, <26, (18, 22, 7)>, <27, (8, 14, 10)>, <28, (0, 17, 25)>, <29, (12, 21, 0)>.

There are a total of [19] 3-star graphs present in the given graph.
