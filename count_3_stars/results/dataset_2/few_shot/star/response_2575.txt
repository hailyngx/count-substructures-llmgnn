Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. If it does, then it is the center of a 3-star graph. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (3, 2, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [10].
