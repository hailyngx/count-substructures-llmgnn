Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

In this graph:
- Node 0 has the neighbors 9, 7, and 1.
- Node 1 has the neighbors 5, 3, and 0.
- Node 2 has the neighbors 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 has the neighbors 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 4 has the neighbors 9, 8, and 6.
- Node 5 has the neighbors 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 has the neighbors 4, 8, and 2.
- Node 7 has the neighbors 9, 0, and 3.
- Node 8 has the neighbors 5, 9, and 4.
- Node 9 has the neighbors 8, 4, and 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (9, 7, 1)>
2. 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (5, 3, 0)>
3. 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (5, 9, 7)>
5. 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (9, 8, 6)>
6. 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (8, 1, 3)>
7. 3-star with center at node 6: <6, (4, 8, 2)>
8. 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (9, 0, 3)>
9. 3-star with center at node 8: <8, (5, 9, 4)>
10. 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (8, 4, 3)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
