Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can scan through the graph and find all such instances.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 13)>
<13, (9, 8, 14)>
<10, (1, 11, 12)>
<7, (6, 4, 12)>
<5, (6, 3, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and output the final answer inside brackets:
