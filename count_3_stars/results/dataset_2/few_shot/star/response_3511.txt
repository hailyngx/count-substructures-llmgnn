Response:
First, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency lists, we see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
Node 0 (connected to 7, 2, 16), 
Node 1 (connected to 9, 4, 2), 
Node 6 (connected to 9, 5), 
Node 9 (connected to 6, 4, 17), 
Node 15 (connected to 1, 19, 14), 
Node 16 (connected to 8, 10, 0), 
Node 17 (connected to 9, 7, 10), and 
Node 19 (connected to 5, 15, 11). 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

[
By examining the provided edges and using the information from the adjacency list, we get the following count: 

<0, (7, 2, 16)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 17)>
<15, (1, 19, 14)>
<16, (8, 10, 0)>
<17, (9, 7, 10)>
<19, (5, 15, 11)>

Count = 8
