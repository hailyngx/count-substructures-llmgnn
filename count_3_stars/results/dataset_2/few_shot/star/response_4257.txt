Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by examining each node. Remember, a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 6, 13, and 1.
    <0, (6, 13, 1)>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 10, 23, and 0.
    <1, (10, 23, 0)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 1, so we don't count it again.

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 15, 16, and 10.
    <2, (15, 16, 10)>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 28 and 17.

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 17, 10, and 29.
    <4, (6, 17, 10)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 4, so we don't count it again.

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 22 and 13.

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0.
    <6, (9, 4, 0)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 6, so we don't count it again.

8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 21, 23, 26, and 13.

9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 14, 19, and 10.

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 22, 18, 25, and 20.
    <9, (22, 18, 25)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 9, so we don't count it again.

11. Node 10: Connected to nodes 13, 4, 1, 8, and 2.
    <10, (13, 4, 1)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 10, so we don't count it again.

12. Node 11: Connected to node 21.

13. Node 12: Connected to nodes 14, 19, and 20.

14. Node 13: Connected to nodes 7, 5, 10, and 0.

15. Node 14: Connected to nodes 17, 8, 12, and 20.

16. Node 15: Connected to nodes 29, 24, and 2.
    <15, (29, 24, 2)>
    Notice the previous 3-star we counted shares node 15, so we don't count it again.

17. Node 16: Connected to nodes 27, 26, and 2.

18. Node 17: Connected to nodes 3, 14, and 4.

19. Node 18: Connected to nodes 9 and 21.

20. Node 19: Connected to nodes 8, 12, and 23.

21. Node 20: Connected to nodes 9, 14, 26, and 12.

22. Node 21: Connected to nodes 7, 28, 11, and 18.

23. Node 22: Connected to nodes 9, 25, 5, and 29.

24. Node 23: Connected to nodes 7, 1, and 19.

25. Node 24: Connected to node 15.

26. Node 25: Connected to nodes 9 and 22.

27. Node 26: Connected to nodes 7, 20, and 16.

28. Node 27: Connected to node 16.

29. Node 28: Connected to nodes 21 and 3.

30. Node 29: Connected to nodes 22, 4, and 15.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 13, 1)>
<2, (15, 16, 10)>
<4, (6, 17, 10)>
<9, (22, 18, 25)>
<10, (13, 4, 1)>
<15, (29, 24, 2)>
<19, (8, 12, 23)>
