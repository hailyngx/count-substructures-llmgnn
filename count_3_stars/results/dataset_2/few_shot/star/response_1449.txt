Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (9, 8, 7)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (13, 10, 4)>
  
3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.

4. For Node 3:
    - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.
  
5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (5, 11, 9)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 1)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 0)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 11, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 11, 1)>

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.

7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (10, 7, 4)>
  
8. For Node 7:
    - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.
    
9. For Node 8:
    - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.

10. For Node 9:
   - <9, (5, 11, 4)>
   - <9, (5, 11, 0)>
   
11. For Node 10:
   - <10, (13, 11, 6)>
  
12. For Node 11:
   - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.
   
13. For Node 12:
    - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.
   
14. For Node 13:
   - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.
   
15. For Node 14:
    - No 3-star as the node has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
