Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes directly connected to each node. We can now find the 3-stars which are structures formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (17, 2, 16)>
<27, (22, 9, 16)>
<20, (25, 14, 22)>
<8, (23, 10, 18)>
<23, (26, 18, 1)>
<28, (29, 14, 22)>
<17, (18, 7, 0)>
<19, (26, 4, 28)>
<6, (21, 7, 12)>
<5, (29, 24, 8)>
<21, (12, 15, 6)>
<16, (24, 15, 27)>
<10, (1, 18, 7)>
<29, (5, 12, 28)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
