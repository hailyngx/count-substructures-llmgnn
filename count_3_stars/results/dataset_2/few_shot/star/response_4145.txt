Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We will start by looking for the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Central nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 5: (2,17,0)
- Node 10: (17,0,8)
- Node 1: (10,6,14)
- Node 16: (0,2,19)
- Node 17: (5,10,3)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5,(2,17,0)>
<10,(17,0,8)>
<1,(10,6,14)>
<16,(0,2,19)>
<17,(5,10,3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
