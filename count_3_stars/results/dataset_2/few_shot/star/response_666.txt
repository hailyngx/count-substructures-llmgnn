Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. For each node identified in step 1, list all possible 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through these steps:

Step 1: Nodes with three neighbors (central nodes):
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, only Node 2 can be the central node of 3-stars.

Step 2: List all possible 3-stars with Node 2 as the center:
- <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- <2, (5, 6, 3)>
- <2, (5, 0, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- There are 3 unique 3-stars formed with Node 2 as the center.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- <2, (5, 6, 3)>
- <2, (5, 0, 3)>
