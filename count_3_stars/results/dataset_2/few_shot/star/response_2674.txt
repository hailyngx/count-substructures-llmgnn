Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will first identify the central nodes and check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Considering the adjacency list, we find the central nodes as follows:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 6 (3 leaves).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 13 (3 leaves).
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 2 (3 leaves).
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 14 (3 leaves).
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 5 (3 leaves).
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 1 (3 leaves).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (14, 11, 6)>
<3, (4, 10, 13)>
<6, (13, 4, 2)>
<10, (7, 11, 14)>
<11, (4, 10, 5)>
<5, (7, 11, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [6].
