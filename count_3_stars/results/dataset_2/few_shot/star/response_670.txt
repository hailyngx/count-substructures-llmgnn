Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 0, 4, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 7, 12, and node 14

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars we find:

<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (8, 0, 4)>
<2, (10, 7, 12)>
<3, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (10, 7, 14)>
<6, (3, 11, 4)>
<7, (9, 0, 5)>
<8, (10, 12, 0)>
<9, (4, 11, 3)>
<10, (11, 8, 2)>
<11, (6, 9, 12)>
<12, (11, 2, 13)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<14, (10, 2, 5)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
