Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 13, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 14, 11, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 10, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 12, 11, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 3, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 14, 2, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, 13, 3, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 11, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 7, 11, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Considering the adjacency list provided and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8, 14)>
- <1, (6, 4, 13)>
- <2, (4, 10, 14)>
- <3, (9, 8, 14)>
- <4, (7, 12, 10)>
- <5, (13, 11, 12)>
- <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (6, 0, 12)>
- <9, (6, 11, 3)>
- <10, (4, 14, 2)>
- <11, (5, 9, 13)>
- <12, (5, 4, 8)>
- <13, (5, 7, 11)>
- <14, (0, 3, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
