Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can go through each node and see if it forms a 3-star. Since a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for each node that has exactly three neighboring nodes.
2. For each node found in step 1, check if its neighbors form a 3-star structure.

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.

We can see that nodes 6 and 7 do not have exactly three neighboring nodes, so they do not form 3-stars.

Let's continue looking for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighboring nodes: 10, 12, 5.
- Node 0, along with its neighbors (10, 12, 5), forms a 3-star. <0, (10, 12, 5)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 8, 12, 4.
- Node 1, along with its neighbors (8, 12, 4), forms a 3-star. <1, (8, 12, 4)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 3 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 4 has 5 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 5 has 5 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 8 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 9 has 5 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 10 has 6 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 11 has 5 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 12 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 13 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 14 has 4 neighboring nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (10, 12, 5)> and <1, (8, 12, 4)>.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
