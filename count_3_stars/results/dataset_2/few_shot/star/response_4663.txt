Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars.

1. For each node in the graph, find all unique 3-stars where the node serves as the center with exactly three connected nodes. 

After identifying all the 3-stars, count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 2, 13)>
<1, (6, 13, 11)>
<2, (8, 6, 14)>
<3, (8, 5, 14)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<5, (8, 6, 13)>
<6, (2, 5, 10)>
<7, (8, 10, 14)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
