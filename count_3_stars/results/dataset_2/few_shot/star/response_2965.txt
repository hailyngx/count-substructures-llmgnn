Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Since the center of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can go through each node and identify if it has exactly three neighbors. 

2. We will then check if those three neighbors are connected to each other, forming a 3-star shape.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's proceed: 

<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 12, 3)>
<8, (5, 13, 0)>
<13, (8, 4, 14)>
<4, (5, 13, 10)>
<12, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (9, 11, 6)>
<10, (4, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 14, 3)>
<1, (12, 0, 6)>
<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<14, (13, 0, 11)>
<7, (13, 10, 6)>
<6, (8, 3, 11)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us [14].
