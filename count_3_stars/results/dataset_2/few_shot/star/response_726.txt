Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's identify the 3-star patterns:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 29, and 13. 
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, and 22.
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 25, and 19.
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 11, and 5.
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 21, and 10.
6. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 2, and 29.
7. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 22.
8. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 26, and 11.
9. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 7, and 25.
10. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 20, and 4.
11. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 19, and 0.
12. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 18.
13. Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 6, and 19.
14. Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 29, and 23.
15. Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 27, and 11.

There are 15 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
