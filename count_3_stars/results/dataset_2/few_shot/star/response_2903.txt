Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <0, (7, 22, 28)> 
2. <1, (25, 21, 29)> 
3. <2, (16, 24, 28)> 
4. <3, (23, 9, 19)> 
5. <4, (7, 17, 26)> 
6. <5, (23, 18, 14)> 
7. <6, (7, 9, 24)> 
8. <8, (21, 29, 20)> 
9. <10, (12, 16, 28)> 
10. <11, (24, 19, 13)> 
11. <12, (16, 18, 26)> 
12. <15, (11, 26, 15)> 
13. <22, (0, 24, 25)> 
14. <27, (29, 20, 8)> 

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [14]
