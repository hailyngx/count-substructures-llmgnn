Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
In this graph, the possible center nodes are 2, 4, and 8. 

Step 2: For each center node, identify the leaves that are connected to the center node. 
For center node 2: Leaves are 6, 9, 4, 7, and 3
For center node 4: Leaves are 9, 8, and 3
For center node 8: Leaves are 6, 4, 5, and 1

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars formed for each center node. 
For node 2: 3-stars = 3 (if center node) * 5 (number of leaves) = 15
For node 4: 3-stars = 3 (if center node) * 3 (number of leaves) = 9
For node 8: 3-stars = 3 (if center node) * 4 (number of leaves) = 12

[Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 15 (from node 2) + 9 (from node 4) + 12 (from node 8) = 36]

Therefore, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 9, 4, 7, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 4, 5, 1)>
