Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. We will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star.

Starting from Node 0:
- <0, (6, 10, 14)>
- <0, (6, 10, 2)>
- <0, (6, 14, 13)>
Total: 3

Moving to Node 1:
- No 3-star centered at Node 1.

Checking Node 2:
- <2, (5, 4, 3)>
- <2, (5, 4, 0)>
Total: 2

Processing Node 3:
- No 3-star centered at Node 3.

Examining Node 4:
- <4, (5, 10, 3)>
Total: 1

Looking at Node 5:
- No 3-star centered at Node 5.

Analyzing Node 6:
- <6, (9, 7, 10)>
- <6, (9, 7, 11)>
Total: 2

Checking Node 7:
- No 3-star centered at Node 7.

Looking at Node 8:
- No 3-star centered at Node 8.

Processing Node 9:
- No 3-star centered at Node 9.

Checking Node 10:
- No 3-star centered at Node 10.

Examining Node 11:
- No 3-star centered at Node 11.

Looking at Node 12:
- <12, (5, 9, 13)>
Total: 1

Processing Node 13:
- No 3-star centered at Node 13.

Analyzing Node 14:
- No 3-star centered at Node 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 10, 14)>, <0, (6, 10, 2)>, <0, (6, 14, 13)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <4, (5, 10, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 10)>, <6, (9, 7, 11)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>.
