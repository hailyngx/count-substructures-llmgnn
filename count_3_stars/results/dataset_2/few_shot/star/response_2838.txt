Response:
Looking at the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the central node for each potential 3-star. Then, we will confirm if the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes are: 13, 22, 27, 8, 20, 5, 26, 17, 1, 4, 10, 28.

Now, let's check if these central nodes are indeed connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Central node 13 is connected to 21, 16, 29, 10 <13, (21, 16, 29)>
- Central node 22 is connected to 26, 4, 5, 10 <22, (26, 4, 5)>
- Central node 27 is connected to 15, 14, 17 <27, (15, 14, 17)>
- Central node 8 is connected to 23, 29, 11 <8, (23, 29, 11)>
- Central node 20 is connected to 17, 3, 24 <20, (17, 3, 24)>
- Central node 5 is connected to 22, 6, 14 <5, (22, 6, 14)>
- Central node 26 is connected to 14, 2, 29 <26, (14, 2, 29)>
- Central node 17 is connected to 27, 20, 1 <17, (27, 20, 1)>
- Central node 1 is connected to 17, 9, 18 <1, (17, 9, 18)>
- Central node 4 is connected to 26, 9, 24 <4, (26, 9, 24)>
- Central node 10 is connected to 13, 22, 15 <10, (13, 22, 15)>
- Central node 28 is connected to 0, 16, 9 <28, (0, 16, 9)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: <13, (21, 16, 29)>, <22, (26, 4, 5)>, <27, (15, 14, 17)>, <8, (23, 29, 11)>, <20, (17, 3, 24)>, <5, (22, 6, 14)>, <26, (14, 2, 29)>, <17, (27, 20, 1)>, <1, (17, 9, 18)>, <4, (26, 9, 24)>, <10, (13, 22, 15)>, <28, (0, 16, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars: [12]
