Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (4, 3, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<1, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (4, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 1)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 21.]
