Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these instances:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 22, 27, and 0. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 22, 27, and 0 as the leaves. <4, (22, 27, 0)>

2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 25, 2, and 1. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 25, 2, and 1 as the leaves. <7, (25, 2, 1)>

3. Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 15. This forms a 3-star with node 10 as the center and nodes 3, 2, and 15 as the leaves. <10, (3, 2, 15)>

4. Node 16 is connected to nodes 27, 29, and 1. This forms a 3-star with node 16 as the center and nodes 27, 29, and 1 as the leaves. <16, (27, 29, 1)>

5. Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 29, and 17. This forms a 3-star with node 21 as the center and nodes 3, 29, and 17 as the leaves. <21, (3, 29, 17)>

6. Node 24 is connected to nodes 22, 23, and 29. This forms a 3-star with node 24 as the center and nodes 22, 23, and 29 as the leaves. <24, (22, 23, 29)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (22, 27, 0)>
<7, (25, 2, 1)>
<10, (3, 2, 15)>
<16, (27, 29, 1)>
<21, (3, 29, 17)>
<24, (22, 23, 29)>
