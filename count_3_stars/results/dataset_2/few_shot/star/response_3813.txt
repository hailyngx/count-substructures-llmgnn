Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we check if these nodes form a 3-star graph. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7 and 14.

2. Check if these nodes form a 3-star graph:
- Node 0 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 2 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 10 is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <>
