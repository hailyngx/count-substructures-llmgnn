3. Node 2: (6, 2, 8), (2, 8, 13), (2, 8, 14)
4. Node 3: (7, 3, 4)
5. Node 4: (6, 4, 10), (14, 4, 10), (3, 4, 10), (1, 4, 10), (4, 1, 8)
6. Node 5: (12, 5, 8), (1, 5, 8)
7. Node 6: (10, 6, 2)
8. Node 7: (9, 7, 12), (7, 12, 8), (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 11)
9. Node 8: (7, 8, 12), (0, 8, 10), (1, 8, 5), (1, 8, 4), (2, 8, 13)
10. Node 9: (12, 9, 13), (0, 9, 1)
11. Node 10: (0, 10, 6), (14, 10, 4), (4, 10, 1), (13, 10, 6)
12. Node 11: (14, 11, 3)
13. Node 12: (7, 12, 8), (13, 12, 2), (5, 12, 8)
14. Node 13: (10, 13, 9), (12, 13, 2), (13, 2, 8)
15. Node 14: (2, 14, 10), (11, 14, 4)
