Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<3, (5, 15, 19)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (3, 15, 1)>
<6, (17, 13, 19)>
<8, (4, 18, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<11, (14, 18, 17)>
<13, (6, 10, 7)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
