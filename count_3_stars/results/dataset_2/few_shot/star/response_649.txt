Response:
The given graph represents a network with 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 22, 7)>
<2, (11, 7, 0)>
<3, (15, 24, 8)>
<4, (27, 18, 21)>
<5, (11, 6, 28)>
<6, (15, 21, 0)>
<7, (16, 2, 22)>
<8, (16, 3, None)>
<9, (11, 29, 13)>
<10, (28, None, None)>
<11, (22, 5, 2)>
<12, (20, 23, None)>
<13, (9, 23, 24)>
<14, (27, 19, None)>
<15, (3, 6, None)>
<16, (7, 8, 18)>
<17, (27, 24, 23)>
<18, (16, 4, None)>
<19, (21, 14, 24)>
<20, (12, 27, None)>
<21, (6, 4, 19)>
<22, (11, 7, 1)>
<23, (12, 17, 26)>
<24, (3, 17, 19)>
<25, (5, 13, 22)>
<26, (29, 23, None)>
<27, (4, 14, 20)>
<28, (5, 10, None)>
<29, (9, 26, None)>

Count of 3-stars: [29]
