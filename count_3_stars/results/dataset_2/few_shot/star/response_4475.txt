Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3: (3, 9, 2)
2. Node 15: (15, 27, 23), (15, 27, 5)
3. Node 18: (18, 22, 5), (18, 22, 12)
4. Node 22: (22, 18, 29), (22, 18, 7)
5. Node 10: (10, 11, 2), (10, 11, 26)
6. Node 11: (11, 10, 13)
7. Node 28: (28, 16, 20), (28, 16, 19)
8. Node 29: (29, 22, 17), (29, 22, 0), (29, 22, 25)
