Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, and 9: <0, (7, 2, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 6: <1, (7, 5, 6)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 1: <3, (4, 8, 1)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 6: <4, (7, 5, 6)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 3: <8, (6, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
