Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars, and the nodes connected to them via an edge will be the leaves.

From the adjacency list provided, we can determine the 3-stars:
1. Node 15: <15, (26, 0, 18)>
2. Node 16: <16, (25, 21, 12)>
3. Node 18: <18, (28, 16, 19)>
4. Node 19: <19, (28, 16, 23)>
5. Node 21: <21, (15, 29, 8)>
6. Node 22: <22, (26, 28, 5)>
7. Node 26: <26, (22, 14, 15)>
8. Node 28: <28, (4, 22, 19)>
9. Node 29: <29, (9, 20, 27)>

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
