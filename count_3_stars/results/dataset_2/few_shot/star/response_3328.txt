Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, and node 2

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step. 

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 
- Node 0: 4, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 5, 0
- Node 2: 7, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 6, 2, 8
- Node 4: 7, 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6, 2
- Node 6: 4, 1, 3, 5, 0
- Node 7: 4, 2, 9, 8
- Node 8: 7, 3, 0, 9
- Node 9: 7, 0, 8, 2

Step 2: For each node, check if there is a 3-star centered at that node.
- Node 0: No 3-star.
- Node 1: No 3-star.
- Node 2: No 3-star.
- Node 3: No 3-star.
- Node 4: <4, (7, 1, 6)>
- Node 5: No 3-star.
- Node 6: <6, (4, 1, 5)>
- Node 7: No 3-star.
- Node 8: No 3-star.
- Node 9: No 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 1, 6)> and <6, (4, 1, 5)>.
