Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be determined by counting the number of paths of length 2 that contain the node as the center. In other words, we need to count the number of triplets where each pair of nodes has a direct edge between them.

The numbers of triangles may not be obvious to calculate directly. To find all triangles, we will consider each node as the center of a 3-star and identify the leaves connected to it. We will then count the unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows: 
<1, (6, 18, 25)>
<2, (15, 18, 19)>
<3, (5, 8, 25)>
<4, (14, 22, 23)>
<6, (1, 23, 25)>
<7, (21, 24, 17)>
<9, (17, 27, 28)>
<10, (9, 11, 18)>
<11, (25, 20, 29)>
<13, (19, 24, 26)>
<14, (4, 8, 29)>
<15, (2, 23, 27)>
<16, (5, 19, 27)>
<17, (9, 19, 21)>
<18, (1, 2, 26)>
<19, (2, 13, 20)>
<20, (11, 23, 29)>
<21, (7, 17, 24)>
<22, (4, 5, 14)>
<23, (4, 6, 15)>
<24, (7, 13, 21)>
<25, (3, 11, 6)>
<26, (3, 13, 18)>
<27, (13, 15, 16)>
<29, (11, 14, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
