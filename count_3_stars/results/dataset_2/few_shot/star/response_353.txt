Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list and edges, we can see that the possible 3-stars involving each node are:
   - Node 0: <0, (7, 6, 2)>
   - Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 3)>
   - Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (2, 8, 0)>
   - Node 3: <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (3, 2, 0)>
   - Node 4: <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (4, 6, 0)>
   - Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (5, 3, 7)>
   - Node 6: <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (6, 8, 0)>
   - Node 7: <7, (5, 7, 3)>, <7, (7, 0, 2)>
   - Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 2)>
   - Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>

2. Now, we count the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (7, 6, 2)>
   - <1, (5, 9, 3)>
   - <2, (4, 7, 3)>
   - <2, (2, 8, 0)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 1)>
   - <3, (3, 2, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 8, 2)>
   - <4, (4, 6, 0)>
   - <5, (9, 6, 1)>
   - <5, (5, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 4)>
   - <6, (6, 8, 0)>
   - <7, (5, 7, 3)>
   - <7, (7, 0, 2)>
   - <8, (4, 6, 2)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [16]
