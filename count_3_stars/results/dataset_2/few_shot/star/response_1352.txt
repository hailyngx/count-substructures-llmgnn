Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to determine all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to each node. 
Let's go through each node and list out the 3-stars present in the graph:

- For Node 0: <0, (9, 3, 2)> and <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- For Node 1: No 3-stars since it has 2 leaves connected to it.
- For Node 2: <2, (9, 6, 8)> and <2, (9, 4, 0)>
- For Node 3: <3, (5, 0, 6)> and <3, (5, 8, 0)>
- For Node 4: <4, (9, 1, 2)> and <4, (9, 0, 7)>
- For Node 5: <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- For Node 6: <6, (7, 3, 5)>
- For Node 7: No 3-stars since it has 2 leaves connected to it.
- For Node 8: <8, (9, 1, 3)>
- For Node 9: <9, (8, 4, 2)> and <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>
<3, (5, 0, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 3, 5)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>
