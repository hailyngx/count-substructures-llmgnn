Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking at each node as the potential center node and checking if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Here is the list of all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (7, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [10]
