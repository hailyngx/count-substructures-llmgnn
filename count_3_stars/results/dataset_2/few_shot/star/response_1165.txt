Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list and the edges given, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
