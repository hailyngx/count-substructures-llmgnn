Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Identify all possible 3-stars:

    Possible 3-stars centered at each node:
    - Node 0: <0, (10, 25)>
    - Node 1: <1, (2, 7, 27)>, <1, (24, 15, 28)>
    - Node 2: No 3-star since it only has one connection.
    - Node 3: <3, (26, 6, 19)>
    - Node 4: No 3-star since it only has one connection.
    - Node 5: <5, (18, 13, 21)>, <5, (16, 23, 5)>
    - Node 6: <6, (13, 3, 19)>, <6, (11, 3, 26)>
    - Node 7: No 3-star since it only has one connection.
    - Node 8: <8, (4, 20, 12)>
    - Node 9: <9, (23, 10, 13)>
    - Node 10: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 11: <11, (22, 26, 27)>, <11, (6, 13, 3)>
    - Node 12: <12, (17, 8, 19)>
    - Node 13: <13, (28, 5, 9)>, <13, (6, 11, 3)>
    - Node 14: No 3-star since it only has one connection.
    - Node 15: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 16: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 17: <17, (14, 29, 22)>
    - Node 18: <18, (20, 21, 5)>
    - Node 19: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 20: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 21: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 22: No 3-star since it has three connections but all connecting nodes are the same.
    - Node 23: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 24: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 25: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 26: <26, (12, 3, 11)>
    - Node 27: No 3-star since it only has two connections.
    - Node 28: <28, (14, 13, 15)>
    - Node 29: No 3-star since it only has two connections.

2. Counting unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (10, 25)>
    - <1, (2, 7, 27)>
    - <1, (24, 15, 28)>
    - <3, (26, 6, 19)>
    - <5, (18, 13, 21)>
    - <5, (16, 23, 5)>
    - <6, (13, 3, 19)>
    - <6, (11, 3, 26)>
    - <8, (4, 20, 12)>
    - <9, (23, 10, 13)>
    - <11, (22, 26, 27)>
    - <11, (6, 13, 3)>
    - <12, (17, 8, 19)>
    - <13, (28, 5, 9)>
    - <13, (6, 11, 3)>
    - <17, (14, 29, 22)>
    - <18, (20, 21, 5)>
    - <26, (12, 3, 11)>
    - <28, (14, 13, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
