Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information:

1. Node 1: (3, 6, 8)
2. Node 3: (1, 5, 4)
3. Node 7: (5, 9, 8)

Now, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>] 
[Total number of 3-stars: 3]
