Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by a central node and three leaves connected to it. Let's go through each node and see if any of them form a 3-star with their neighbors:

1. Node 0: (0, 4, 12), (0, 14, 12)
2. Node 1: (1, 14, 15)
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it has 3 neighbors but they do not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 12), (4, 7, 11)
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
7. Node 6: No connections to form a 3-star.
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 11), (7, 13, 16)
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 14), (9, 10, 13)
11. Node 10: No 3-star as it has 3 neighbors, but they do not form a 3-star.
12. Node 11: No 3-star as it has 3 neighbors, but they do not form a 3-star.
13. Node 12: (12, 0, 13)
14. Node 13: (13, 9, 12), (13, 7, 18)
15. Node 14: (14, 9, 15)
16. Node 15: (15, 1, 14)
17. Node 16: (16, 7, 17), (16, 19, 1)
18. Node 17: No 3-star as it has 4 neighbors, but they do not form a 3-star.
19. Node 18: No 3-star as it has 2 neighbors, but they do not form a 3-star.
20. Node 19: No 3-star as it has 4 neighbors, but they do not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 12, 14)>, <0, (4, 12, 0)>, <4, (0, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (13, 16, 7)>, <9, (2, 14, 9)>, <9, (10, 13, 9)>, <12, (0, 13, 9)>, <13, (9, 12, 13)>, <13, (7, 18, 13)>, <14, (9, 15, 14)>, <15, (1, 14, 15)>, <16, (7, 17, 16)>, <16, (19, 1, 16)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
