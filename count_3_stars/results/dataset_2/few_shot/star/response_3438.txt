Node 18 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 2
Node 19 is connected to node 3, 15, 13, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
    - Node 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 are not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
    - Nodes 1, 5, 6, 13 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
    - Nodes 3, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19 are connected to more than 3 other nodes.
    - Node 11 and 14 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Step 2: For each node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, identify the 3-stars.
    - For Node 1: (17, 12, 6)
    - For Node 5: (14, 0, 10)
    - For Node 6: (11, 1, 19)
    - For Node 13: (3, 19, 15)
    - For Node 11: (16, 14, 18)
    - For Node 14: (17, 8, 9)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
    - There are 6 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
Unique 3-stars: <1, (17, 12, 6)>, <5, (14, 0, 10)>, <6, (11, 1, 19)>, <13, (3, 19, 15)>, <11, (16, 14, 18)>, <14, (17, 8, 9)>
