Response:
We can start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and list down all the 3-stars we find:

1. Node 0: (1, 28, 19), (1, 5, 0), (1, 28, 17)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 28), (1, 5, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 13, 3), (2, 3, 19), (2, 16, 15)
4. Node 3: (3, 25, 4)
5. Node 5: (5, 11, 12), (5, 12, 1)
6. Node 6: (6, 13, 22), (6, 28, 1), (6, 12, 5)
7. Node 8: (8, 23, 28), (8, 28, 17)
8. Node 10: (10, 25, 11)
9. Node 11: (11, 10, 23), (11, 14, 7)
10. Node 12: (12, 4, 6), (12, 5, 1), (12, 29, 19)
11. Node 13: (13, 22, 6), (13, 2, 3)
12. Node 14: (14, 11, 26)
13. Node 15: (15, 2, 21), (15, 21, 16)
14. Node 16: (16, 13, 14), (16, 2, 15)
15. Node 17: (17, 8, 21)
16. Node 19: (19, 18, 2), (19, 12, 0)
17. Node 21: (21, 26, 15)
18. Node 22: (22, 13, 6)
19. Node 25: (25, 3, 29)
20. Node 27: (27, 14, 7)
21. Node 28: (28, 8, 6), (28, 6, 0)
22. Node 29: (29, 25, 12)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [22] and they are:
<1, (28, 19, 0)>, <1, (28, 6, 0)>, <1, (5, 0, 1)>, <2, (16, 15, 2)>, <2, (3, 19, 2)>, <2, (13, 3, 2)>, <5, (12, 1, 5)>, <5, (11, 12, 5)>, <6, (13, 22, 6)>, <6, (12, 5, 1)>, <6, (28, 1, 6)>, <8, (23, 28, 8)>, <8, (28, 17, 8)>, <10, (25, 11, 10)>, <11, (14, 7, 11)>, <11, (10, 23, 11)>, <12, (29, 19, 12)>, <12, (5, 1, 12)>, <12, (4, 6, 12)>, <13, (2, 3, 13)>, <13, (22, 6, 13)>, <16, (2, 15, 16)>, <16, (13, 14, 16)>
