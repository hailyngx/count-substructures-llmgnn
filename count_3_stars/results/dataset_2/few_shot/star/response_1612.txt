Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph based on the definition provided.

The central nodes in a potential 3-star pattern are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will check each node and its connections to see if there are any 3-star patterns.
- Node 0: (0, 5, 3, 6) forms a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6) forms a 3-star.
- Node 2: (2, 5, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.
- Node 3: No 3-star pattern found.
- Node 4: (4, 7, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 5: No 3-star pattern found.
- Node 6: No 3-star pattern found.
- Node 7: No 3-star pattern found.
- Node 8: No 3-star pattern found.
- Node 9: No 3-star pattern found.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [3]
