Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 13, 7, 27, and 29 are the central nodes of some potential 3-stars because each of these nodes is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find all the unique 3-stars:

<13, (22, 12, 29)>
<7, (13, 17, 21)>
<27, (14, 12, 1)>
<29, (18, 1, 23)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
