Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 12) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 10, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 12, 2, 10, and node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 12, 1, 13, 14, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 12, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 10, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 14, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, 5, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 14, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 2, 13, 1, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 12, 1, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 2

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-star subgraphs found in the graph:
<0, (7, 9, 10)>
<1, (6, 9, 12)>
<2, (7, 12, 13)>
<3, (12, 5, 0)>
<4, (5, 14, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<7, (0, 2, 13)>
<8, (5, 6, 10)>
<9, (0, 1, 14)>
<10, (0, 1, 5)>
<12, (8, 2, 13)>
<13, (7, 12, 2)>
<14, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
