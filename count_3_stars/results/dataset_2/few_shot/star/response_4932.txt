Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can manually identify the central node and its connected nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (3, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 14)>
<2, (4, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<6, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 2)>
<8, (5, 13, 14)>
<9, (5, 11, 13)>
<10, (11, 13, 14)>
<11, (5, 9, 12)>
<12, (4, 7, 11)>
<13, (9, 10, 8)>
<14, (1, 10, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
