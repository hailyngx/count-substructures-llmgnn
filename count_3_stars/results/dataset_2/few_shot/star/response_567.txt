Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 16, 18)>
<1, (7, 3, 13)>
<2, (1, 6, 11)>
<3, (9, 1, 10)>
<4, (7, 16, -)>
<5, (8, 17, -)>
<6, (10, 2, 19)>
<7, (4, 15, -)>
<8, (5, 9, 11)>
<9, (8, 3, -)>
<10, (17, 3, 6)>
<11, (8, 2, -)>
<12, (15, 19, -)>
<13, (14, 1, -)>
<14, (17, 19, 13)>
<15, (17, 7, 18)>
<16, (4, 10, 0)>
<17, (5, 14, 10)>
<18, (15, 0, 16)>
<19, (14, 12, 6)>

Based on the listed 3-stars, we observe that each unique 3-star has been accounted for. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
