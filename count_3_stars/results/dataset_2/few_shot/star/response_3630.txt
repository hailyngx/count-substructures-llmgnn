Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 5, 0, and 1. This means that Node 2 is the center of two 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 5)> and <2, (0, 1, 5)>.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 7, 6, and 3. This implies that Node 8 is the center of one 3-star: <8, (4, 2, 7)>.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3, and 2. This means that Node 4 is the center of one 3-star: <4, (8, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, and <8, (4, 2, 7)>.
