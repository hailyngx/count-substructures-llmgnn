Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Given that our graph has 10 nodes, we will examine each node to determine if it is the central node of a 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (8, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<3, (6, 2, -)>

Here, we have listed the unique 3-stars found in the graph. The last entry '<3, (6, 2, -)>' indicates that node 3 does not form a complete 3-star since it is only connected to 2 out of the required 3 nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
