Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node forms a 3-star with three other nodes connected to it. 

Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (7, 1, 15)>
2. <1, (3, 11, 0)>
3. <2, (11, 8, 18)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <5, (3, 12, 15)>
6. <6, (3, 14, 9)>
7. <7, (4, 12, 9)>
8. <9, (7, 3, 6)>
9. <11, (1, 14, 0)>
10. <12, (7, 5, 19)>
11. <15, (7, 9, 18)>
12. <16, (10, 19, 16)>
13. <18, (17, 6, 15)>
14. <19, (13, 12, 16)>

The total number of distinct 3-stars in this graph is [14].
