Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be determined by finding all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17.

Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (14, 19, 5)>
<1, (19, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 11)>
<3, (13, 10, 16)>
<4, (1, 11, 3)>
<5, (19, 0, 2)>
<6, (10, 2, 18)>
<7, (12, 15, 14)>
<8, (13, 11, 17)>
<9, (10, 17, 16)>
<11, (8, 2, 4)>
<12, (7, 18, 16)>
<13, (8, 3, 10)>
<14, (7, 0, 16)>
<16, (14, 3, 18)>
<17, (8, 9, 18)>
<18, (17, 12, 16)>
<19, (10, 0, 5)>

There are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [17].
