Response:
Given the graph, we will identify 3-stars, which are subgraphs with one central node and exactly three connected nodes to it. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (4, 16, 2)>
2. <9, (1, 13, 19)>
3. <4, (5, 7, 0)>
4. <7, (4, 14, 17)>
5. <14, (7, 17, 3)>
6. <17, (14, 10, 0)>
7. <10, (17, 11, 3)>
8. <11, (10, 19, 15)>
9. <2, (12, 16, 15)>
10. <3, (14, 10, 12)>
11. <0, (4, 17, 18)>
12. <6, (1, 8, 0)>
13. <12, (2, 13, 3)>
14. <1, (9, 19, 6)>
15. <8, (10, 11, 12)>
16. <13, (9, 12, 16)>
17. <18, (16, 0, 0)>
18. <19, (11, 1, 1)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [18]
