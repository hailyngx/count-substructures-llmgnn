Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of nodes that have exactly 3 edges emanating from them, forming a 3-star structure. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can easily identify the central nodes for each 3-star. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 14)>
<12, (0, 3, 13)>
<13, (4, 8, 12)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we can see that there are [6] 3-stars.
