Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of 3-star configurations around each node. Since a 3-star has 4 nodes (1 as the center and 3 as leaves), we need to go through each node to check if any 3-stars are formed around it. Below are the 3-stars found for each node:

<0, (17, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 19)>
<2, (19, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 14, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 4)>
<5, (0, 8, 16)>
<6, (3, 2, 16)>
<7, (10, 0, 9)>
<8, (19, 5, 2)>
<9, (3, 11, 7)>
<10, (11, 17, 12)>
<11, (10, 9, 18)>
<12, (1, 10, 16)>
<14, (3, 18, 6)>
<15, (17, 19, 9)>
<16, (12, 5, 6)>
<17, (10, 0, 15)>
<18, (14, 11, 9)>
<19, (1, 2, 15)>

There are a total of [18] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
