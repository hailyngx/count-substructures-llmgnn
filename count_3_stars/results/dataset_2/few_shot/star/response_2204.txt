Response:
Let's find the unique 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For node 11:
   - <11, (16, 19, 16)>
   - <11, (16, 19, 19)>
   - <11, (16, 19, 5)>

2. For node 16:
   - <16, (11, 19, 11)>
   - <16, (11, 19, 19)>
   - <16, (11, 19, 14)>

3. For node 19:
   - <19, (11, 16, 11)>
   - <19, (11, 16, 16)>
   - <19, (11, 16, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
