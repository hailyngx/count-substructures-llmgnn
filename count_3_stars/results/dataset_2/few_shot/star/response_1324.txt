Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

- Node 0 forms 2 3-stars: <0, (6, 10, 3)> and <0, (6, 11, 1)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (12, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (7, 13, 14)> and <2, (4, 13, 14)>
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)> and <3, (5, 0, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 13, 2)>
- Node 5 forms 5 3-stars: <5, (6, 13, 8)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (13, 4, 2)>, <5, (8, 7, 12)>, and <5, (3, 0, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (5, 14, 3)>, <6, (5, 12, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 13)>, and <6, (3, 0, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (5, 12, 3)> and <7, (12, 1, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (5, 12, 3)> and <8, (5, 7, 13)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (8, 1, 12)>
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (14, 6, 0)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star: <11, (14, 6, 0)>
- Node 12 forms 2 3-stars: <12, (7, 1, 8)> and <12, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (5, 4, 2)>
- Node 14 forms 2 3-stars: <14, (6, 10, 0)> and <14, (6, 11, 0)>
