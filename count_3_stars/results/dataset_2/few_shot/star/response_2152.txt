Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the central node and its connected nodes.
2. List out all the possible 3-stars by considering each node as the center and its connected nodes as the leaves.
3. Count the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 12, 2)>
<0, (9, 12, 4)>
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<0, (12, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<4, (11, 12, 5)>
<4, (11, 5, 14)>
<4, (12, 5, 14)>
<4, (0, 5, 11)>
<4, (0, 5, 14)>
<4, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 11)>
<5, (0, 4, 14)>
<5, (4, 11, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (6, 13, 10)>
<9, (7, 12, 9)>
<11, (1, 5, 14)>
<13, (1, 10, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
