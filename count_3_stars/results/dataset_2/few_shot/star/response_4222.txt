Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then form 3-stars using these nodes.

Based on the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 6, and 1
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 6
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 6, and 3
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 9, 0, and 3
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 2
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[6]

<0, (7, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
