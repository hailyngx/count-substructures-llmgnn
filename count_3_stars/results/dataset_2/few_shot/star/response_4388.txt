Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 11, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 10, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 10, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 11, 0, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 11, 12, 14, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 1, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 11, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 10, 14, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, 2, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 11, 8, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 7, and 14: <5, (11, 7, 14)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, and 1: <9, (4, 10, 1)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 10, and 0: <1, (3, 10, 0)>
4. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 11, and 2: <10, (3, 11, 2)>
5. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 14: <11, (0, 7, 14)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 14, and 13: <7, (12, 14, 13)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 12, and 1: <8, (14, 12, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
