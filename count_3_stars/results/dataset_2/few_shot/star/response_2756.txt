Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern.

Upon analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 0, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<6, (1, 8, 5)>
<7, (1, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (3, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
