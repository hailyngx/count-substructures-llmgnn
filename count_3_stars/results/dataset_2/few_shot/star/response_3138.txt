Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes (3-stars pattern).
- If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, form a 3-star with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.
- Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 14, 12)>
<1, (6, 4, 13)>
<2, (14, 5, 1)>
<3, (6, 11, 8)>
<4, (9, 14, 1)>
<5, (11, 0, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<7, (13, 11, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 11)>
<9, (6, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 12)>
<11, (10, 3, 13)>
<12, (6, 10, 0)>
<13, (9, 7, 11)>
<14, (6, 4, 0)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
