Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has a 3-star: <0, (7, 1, 6)>
- Node 1 has a 3-star: <1, (9, 2, 10)>
- Node 3 has a 3-star: <3, (17, 10, 6)>
- Node 5 has a 3-star: <5, (18, 11, 15)>
- Node 7 has a 3-star: <7, (0, 19, 15)>
- Node 9 has a 3-star: <9, (18, 14, 1)>
- Node 10 has a 3-star: <10, (4, 19, 2)>
- Node 11 has a 3-star: <11, (5, 12, 15)>
- Node 14 has a 3-star: <14, (9, 18, 6)>
- Node 16 has a 3-star: <16, (13, 8, 17)>
- Node 18 has a 3-star: <18, (5, 9, 19)>
- Node 19 has a 3-star: <19, (7, 18, 15)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find [12].
