Response:
By observing the given graph information, we can find the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

There are multiple ways to find the 3-stars, but a systematic way could be: 
1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If it is, then form a 3-star using that node as the center node and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Let's go through the nodes to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (7, 10, 26)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star <26, (9, 18, 21)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (2, 12, 20)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star <18, (22, 26, -)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star <10, (8, 9, 11)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star <11, (2, 13, 19)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (10, 24, -)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star <22, (2, 12, 19)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star <12, (4, 22, 25)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star <15, (14, 17, 21)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (17, 19, 27)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star <17, (1, 5, 24)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (17, 19, -)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star <14, (7, 15, 29)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (6, 21, 24)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (2, 20, 24)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star <20, (0, 4, -)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star <21, (15, 3, 26)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star <13, (11, 23, -)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (3, 7, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 19.
