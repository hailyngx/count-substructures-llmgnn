Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 13.
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 12, and 13.
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 18, and 19.
4. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 5, and 7.
5. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 13.
6. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 11.
7. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (4, 12, 13)>
<10, (17, 18, 19)>
<12, (11, 5, 7)>
<17, (1, 10, 13)>
<18, (1, 3, 11)>
<19, (3, 6, 10)>
