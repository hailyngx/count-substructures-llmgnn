Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern) and count them. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 0, forming a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 0)>
5. Node 4 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
6. Node 5 does not have three connections to form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
8. Node 7 has three connections to nodes 1, 3, and 8, forming a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
9. Node 8 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
10. Node 9 does not have three connections to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
