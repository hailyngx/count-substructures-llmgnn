Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can act as the central node in a 3-star configuration.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors can act as the central node of a 3-star. Let's list these nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 1, 5, 4
- Node 1: Connected to 2, 10, 9
- Node 3: Connected to 7, 14, 12
- Node 5: Connected to 12, 11, 0
- Node 7: Connected to 3, 2, 6
- Node 8: Connected to 2, 11, 6
- Node 9: Connected to 1, 2, 12
- Node 10: Connected to 1, 13, 12
- Node 13: Connected to 2, 4, 10
- Node 14: Connected to 3, 5, 12

Now, let's count the 3-stars using each of these nodes as the central node:
- Using Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 4)>
- Using Node 1: <1, (2, 10, 9)>
- Using Node 3: <3, (7, 14, 12)>
- Using Node 5: <5, (12, 11, 0)>
- Using Node 7: <7, (3, 2, 6)>
- Using Node 8: <8, (2, 11, 6)>
- Using Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 12)>
- Using Node 10: <10, (1, 13, 12)>
- Using Node 13: <13, (2, 4, 10)>
- Using Node 14: <14, (3, 5, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
