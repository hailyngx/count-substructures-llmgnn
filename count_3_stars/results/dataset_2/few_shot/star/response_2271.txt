Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star graph. The nodes are:
- Node 4 with neighbors 3, 6, 0
- Node 7 with neighbors 6, 9, 5
- Node 2 with neighbors 3, 5, 8

Now, for each potential center node, we check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. We find that:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 1, 0)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (3, 1, 0)>, 
<7, (6, 9, 5)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 8)>.
