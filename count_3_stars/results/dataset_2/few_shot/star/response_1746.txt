Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6)

Node 18 is connected to node 11, 6, and node 3
Node 19 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 10

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Considering the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<8, (1, 2, 17)>
<1, (8, 10, 19)>
<10, (1, 13, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
