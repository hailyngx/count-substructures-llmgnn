Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:
- Each 3-star is uniquely defined by the center node and three connected leaf nodes.
- We will iterate through each node in the graph and check if there are exactly three edges connected to the node. If yes, we will check if these three connections form a 3-star. 
- We will increment the count whenever we find a valid 3-star.
- At the end, we will output the count.

Now, let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0 (connected to 9, 3, 8, and 12):
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star with (9, 8, 12). <0, (9, 8, 12)>

2. For Node 1 (connected to 3, 11, 14, 4, and 8):
    - Node 1 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 8). <1, (3, 4, 8)>

3. For Node 2 (connected to 9, 4, 11, 12, and 7):
    - No 3-stars formed because Node 2 has more than three edges.

4. For Node 3 (connected to 1, 0, and 13):
    - No 3-stars formed because Node 3 has less than three edges.

5. For Node 4 (connected to 5, 1, 8, 6, and 2):
    - Node 4 forms a 3-star with (5, 8, 1). <4, (5, 8, 1)>

6. For Node 5 (connected to 9, 4, and 14):
    - No valid 3-stars formed because Node 5 has less than three edges.

7. For Node 6 (connected to 4, 10, and 14):
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star with (4, 10, 14). <6, (4, 10, 14)>

8. For Node 7 (connected to 9, 8, 13, and 2):
    - Node 7 forms a 3-star with (9, 8, 13). <7, (9, 8, 13)>

9. For Node 8 (connected to 1, 13, 4, 14, 0, and 7):
    - No 3-stars formed because Node 8 has more than three edges.

10. For Node 9 (connected to 5, 2, 7, 0, and 12):
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star with (5, 0, 12). <9, (5, 0, 12)>

11. For Node 10 (connected to 13 and 6):
    - No valid 3-stars formed because Node 10 has less than three edges.

12. For Node 11 (connected to 1 and 2):
    - No valid 3-stars formed because Node 11 has less than three edges.

13. For Node 12 (connected to 9, 0, and 2):
    - No valid 3-stars formed because Node 12 has less than three edges.

14. For Node 13 (connected to 3, 8, 10, 14, and 7):
    - Node 13 forms a 3-star with (3, 14, 7). <13, (3, 14, 7)>

15. For Node 14 (connected to 5, 1, 8, 13, and 6):
    - Node 14 forms a 3-star with (5, 13, 6). <14, (5, 13, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (9, 8, 12)> <1, (3, 4, 8)> <4, (5, 8, 1)> <6, (4, 10, 14)> <7, (9, 8, 13)> <9, (5, 0, 12)>
