Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, formulating a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-star patterns:

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes.
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
5. Node 4: 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 0)>
6. Node 5: 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
10. Node 9: 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 13)>
11. Node 10: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
12. Node 11: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
13. Node 12: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
14. Node 13: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
15. Node 14: No 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-star patterns in the given graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 7, 13)>
