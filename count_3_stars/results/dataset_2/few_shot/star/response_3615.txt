Response:
At first glance, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the center of 3-star graphs. 

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to 3, 12, 14)
- Node 2 (connected to 3, 8, 13)
- Node 6 (connected to 4, 7, 14)
- Node 11 (connected to 0, 12)
- Node 13 (connected to 1, 5, 2)

Now we check each of these nodes if they form a 3-star graph. 

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (12, 14, 2)>
    - <0, (12, 11, 4)>
    - <0, (14, 8, 6)>

2. Node 2:
    - <2, (3, 1, 13)>

3. Node 6:
    - <6, (4, 10, 7)>

4. Node 11:
    - No 3-star can be formed as it only has two neighbors.

5. Node 13:
    - <13, (1, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
