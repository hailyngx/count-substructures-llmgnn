Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-star patterns in the graph are as follows:
<8, (13, 9, 14)>
<13, (8, 1, 0)>
<0, (13, 6, 7)>
<6, (8, 5, 2)>
<7, (13, 0, 2)>
<9, (8, 1, 4)>
<4, (11, 5, 0)>
<5, (11, 8, 6)>
<10, (11, 7, N)>
<11, (10, 9, 5)>
<12, (6, 3, 14)>
<14, (8, 1, 12)>

Counting all the unique 3-star patterns identified above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
