Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These central nodes will form the center of the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The central nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 4: connected to nodes 5, 18, and an extra neighbor
- Node 5: connected to nodes 9, 13, and an extra neighbor
- Node 8: connected to nodes 18, 16, and an extra neighbor
- Node 11: connected to nodes 14, 2, and an extra neighbor
- Node 15: connected to nodes 9, 18, and an extra neighbor
- Node 19: connected to nodes 12, and an extra neighbors

Next, let's list the 3-star graphs based on the given central nodes:

<4, (5, 18, X)>
<5, (9, 13, X)>
<8, (18, 16, X)>
<11, (14, 2, X)>
<15, (9, 18, X)>
<19, (12, X, Y)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-star graphs:
