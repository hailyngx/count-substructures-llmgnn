Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 14, 10, and 19.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 13.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 11.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 14.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 11, and 10.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 7 and 16.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 4.
   - Node 16 is connected to nodes 12, 15, and 17.

2. For each of these nodes, count the number of 3-stars they are part of:
   - Node 1 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 3 participates in 0 3-stars.
   - Node 4 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 5 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 6 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 7 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 12 participates in 0 3-stars.
   - Node 14 participates in 1 3-star.
   - Node 16 participates in 0 3-stars.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 14) = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (14, 10, 19)>
<4, (8, 19, 13)>
<5, (3, 2, 11)>, 
<6, (9, 14)>
<7, (12, 11, 10)>
<14, (6, 1, 4)>
