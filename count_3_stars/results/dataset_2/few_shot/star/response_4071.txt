Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are two 3-stars in the graph.
[2]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
