Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding the central node and its three adjacent nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 13, 7)>
<0, (9, 13, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (13, 7, 3)>
<0, (13, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 11, 2)>
<4, (5, 11, 1)>
<4, (5, 11, 13)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 8, 13)>
<6, (9, 8, 5)>
<6, (9, 8, 10)>
<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<6, (8, 13, 5)>
<6, (8, 13, 10)>
<6, (13, 12, 7)>
<8, (9, 13, 5)>
<8, (9, 13, 10)>
<8, (13, 12, 7)>
<13, (12, 7, 14)>
<1, (0, 11, 5)>
<1, (11, 4, 2)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<3, (3, 0, 5)>
<3, (14, 7, 5)>
<7, (12, 14, 10)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph gives us: [27].
