Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node as a potential center of a 3-star.

For each node, we will check if it has exactly three neighbors, then we will list the 3-stars with that node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars identified:
<0, (8, 12, 13)>
<1, (14, 29, 13)>
<2, (23, 12, 24)>
<3, (17, 16, 19)>
<4, (16, 20, 15)>
<5, (15)>
<6, (9, 10, 25)>
<7, (29, 22, 18)>
<8, (10, 23, 24)>
<9, (26, 6, 27)>
<10, (6, 8, 19)>
<11, (29)>
<12, (21, 2, 0)>
<13, (0, 1, 28)>
<14, (1)>
<15, (4, 24, 5)>
<16, (4, 21, 3)>
<17, (3, 19)>
<18, (22, 28, 29)>
<19, (17, 10)>
<20, (4, 6, 27)>
<21, (4, 23, 16)>
<22, (26, 7, 18)>
<23, (8, 2, 21)>
<24, (8, 2, 15)>
<25, (26, 6, 15)>
<26, (9, 22, 25)>
<27, (9, 20)>
<28, (18, 23, 13)>
<29, (7, 11, 18, 21, 1)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [29]
