Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 7 connected to nodes 24, 19, and 7
- Node 4 connected to nodes 3, 29, and 4
- Node 6 connected to nodes 27, 29, and 6
- Node 10 connected to nodes 22, 12, and 10
- Node 21 connected to nodes 28, 29, and 21

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<7, (24, 19, 7)>
<4, (3, 29, 4)>
<6, (27, 29, 6)>
<10, (22, 12, 10)>
<21, (28, 29, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
