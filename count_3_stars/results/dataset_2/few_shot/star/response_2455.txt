Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Starting with Node 0:  
  Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, and 8.  
  There is one 3-star centered at Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>.

- Moving on to Node 1:  
  Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 0.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 1.

- Proceeding to Node 2:  
  Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, and 9.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.

- Analyzing Node 3:  
  Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 0, 6, and 2.  
  There is one 3-star centered at Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 6)>.

- Examining Node 4:  
  Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 7, 9, 3, 1, and 6.  
  There is one 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (7, 9, 3)>.

- Moving to Node 5:  
  Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 7, 6, and 2.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 5.

- Proceeding to Node 6:  
  Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 5, 2, and 8.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 6.

- Analyzing Node 7:  
  Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 3, 6, 9, and 5.  
  There is one 3-star centered at Node 7: <7, (4, 3, 6)>.

- Examining Node 8:  
  Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 0.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 8.

- Finally, analyzing Node 9:  
  Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, and 2.  
  There are no 3-stars centered at Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>  
<3, (4, 7, 6)>  
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
