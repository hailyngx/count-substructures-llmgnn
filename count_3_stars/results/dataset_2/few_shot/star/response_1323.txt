Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to find these 3-stars:

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes**:
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 1, and 2
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8

2. **Build 3-Stars**:
   - <4, (5, 6, 2)>
   - <1, (9, 6, 2)>
   - <8, (5, 1, 2)>
   - <0, (9, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is: **[4]**.
