Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

<1, (21, 15, 8)>
<3, (13, 26, 25)>
<4, (27, 25, 11)>
<10, (6, 23, 14)>
<14, (10, 24, 5)>
<15, (13, 1, 21)>
<17, (29, 26, 25)>
<20, (12, 8, 5)>
<26, (18, 17, 29)>
<29, (17, 26, 25)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, therefore the total number of 3-stars is [10].
