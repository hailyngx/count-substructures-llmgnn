Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by analyzing each node and counting the number of 3-stars it is a part of. Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. These are the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

2. For each potential center node, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with it. A 3-star can be formed with the center and any 3 of its neighbors.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Potential center nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 10, 11}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 11, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {9, 4, 1, 11, 12, 2}
- Node 11: neighbors {5, 4, 7, 10, 2}
- Node 14: neighbors {7, 6, 1, 12, 2, 0}

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each potential center node:
- Node 4: 1 3-star
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
  
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
<7, (4, 11, 14)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 13, 14)>
<7, (11, 13, 14)>

- Node 10: 15 3-stars
<10, (9, 12, 2)>
<10, (9, 1, 12)>
<10, (9, 1, 2)>
<10, (9, 11, 2)>
<10, (9, 4, 11)>
<10, (4, 1, 2)>
<10, (4, 11, 2)>
<10, (4, 11, 12)>
<10, (4, 1, 12)>
<10, (1, 2, 12)>
<10, (1, 11, 12)>
<10, (4, 1, 11)>
<10, (1, 2, 11)>
<10, (1, 11, 2)>
<10, (1, 11, 4)>

- Node 11: 4 3-stars
<11, (4, 7, 2)>
<11, (4, 2, 10)>
<11, (4, 10, 2)>
<11, (10, 4, 7)>

- Node 14: 15 3-stars
<14, (7, 12, 0)>
<14, (7, 2, 0)>
<14, (7, 1, 0)>
<14, (7, 6, 0)>
<14, (7, 2, 12)>
<14, (7, 1, 12)>
<14, (7, 6, 12)>
<14, (6, 1, 0)>
<14, (6, 2, 0)>
<14, (6, 2, 12)>
<14, (6, 1, 12)>
<14, (1, 2, 0)>
<14, (1, 12, 0)>
<14, (2, 12, 0)>
<14, (2, 1, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars we found gives us the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39][].
