Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 14, 11, 13, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 14, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 10, 2, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 13, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 12, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 0, 14, 2, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 10, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 0, 11, and node 8

Response:
There are two 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 5, 14)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
