Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of uniquely connected 3-stars. Let's start by checking each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[<5, (2, 18, 19)>, <13, (1, 16, 21)>, <21, (4, 10, 16)>, <24, (12, 13, 28)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
