Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars we find in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 8)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<2, (9, 5, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 0, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 0)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
