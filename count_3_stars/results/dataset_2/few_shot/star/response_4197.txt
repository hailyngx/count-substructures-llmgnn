Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances correspond to 3-stars.

Analyzing the given graph and adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 4)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<2, (9, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
