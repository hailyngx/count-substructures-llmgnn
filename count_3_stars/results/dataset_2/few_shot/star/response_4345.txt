Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star by looking at its neighbors.
2. If a node has exactly three neighbors, then it is the center of a 3-star.
3. List all the unique 3-stars found.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (11, 13, 19)>
<3, (1, 6, 13)>
<4, (1, 2, 15)>
<5, (8, 16, 19)>
<6, (3, 15, 15)>
<7, (0, 12, 13)>
<8, (5, 16, 19)>
<9, (10, 15, 15)>
<10, (0, 9, 19)>
<11, (2, 4, 17)>
<12, (1, 7, 16)>
<13, (2, 3, 7)>
<15, (4, 6, 17)>
<16, (5, 8, 12)>
<17, (11, 15, 18)>
<18, (0, 17, 0)>
<19, (1, 2, 5)>

There are a total of [18] unique 3-stars in the graph.
