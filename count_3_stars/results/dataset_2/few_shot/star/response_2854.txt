Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

First, let's identify the central nodes. From the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 9, connected to nodes 25, 15, and 28.
- Node 16, connected to nodes 9, 20, and 22.
- Node 17, connected to nodes 3, 15, and 2.
- Node 24, connected to nodes 20, 19, and 7.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<9, (25, 15, 28)>
<16, (9, 20, 22)>
<24, (20, 19, 7)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
