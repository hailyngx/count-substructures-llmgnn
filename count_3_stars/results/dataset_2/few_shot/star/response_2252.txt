Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following connections for each node:
- Node 0: (4, 9, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (9, 3), (9, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5)
- Node 1: (4, 2), (2, 1), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 1)
- Node 3: (9, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8), (0, 5), (0, 8), (5, 8)
- Node 4: (8, 9), (8, 1), (9, 6), (6, 4)
- Node 5: (7, 3), (7, 8), (3, 8)
- Node 6: (4, 7), (7, 8), (4, 9), (9, 6)
- Node 7: (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8)
- Node 8: (4, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 3), (3, 0), (3, 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. We have:
- Node 4: <4, (8, 9, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (7, 8, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (7, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:  <4, (8, 9, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, <8, (7, 6, 5)>.
