Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 2), (5, 9, 4), (5, 9, 7), (5, 2, 4), (5, 2, 7), (5, 4, 7)
2. Node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 8), (9, 5, 4), (9, 5, 7), (9, 6, 8), (9, 6, 4), (9, 6, 7), (9, 8, 4), (9, 8, 7), (9, 4, 7)
3. Node 6: (6, 9, 2), (6, 9, 4), (6, 2, 4)
4. Node 1: (1, 3, 2)
5. Node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 8), (3, 1, 7), (3, 2, 8), (3, 2, 7), (3, 8, 7)
6. Node 4: (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 0), (4, 9, 6), (4, 9, 8), (4, 9, 0), (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 0), (4, 8, 0)
7. Node 8: (8, 9, 3), (8, 9, 4), (8, 9, 2), (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 2), (8, 4, 2)
8. Node 2: (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 1), (2, 6, 1), (2, 5, 3), (2, 6, 3), (2, 1, 3)

There are total of 26 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [26].
