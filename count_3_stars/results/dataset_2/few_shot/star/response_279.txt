Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 12, 2)>
<1, (5, 13, 12)>
<2, (6, 13, 12)>
<5, (10, 13, 1)>
<9, (15, 7, 0)>
<11, (4, 18, 2)>
<12, (17, 0, 2)>
<13, (5, 2, 1)>
<16, (14, 19, 7)>
<17, (12, 4, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 12, 2)>
<1, (5, 13, 12)>
<2, (6, 13, 12)>
<5, (10, 13, 1)>
<9, (15, 7, 0)>
<11, (4, 18, 2)>
<12, (17, 0, 2)>
<13, (5, 2, 1)>
<16, (14, 19, 7)>
<17, (12, 4, 18)>
