Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of 3-stars. Let's identify them and the corresponding leaves.

The nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 6: Connected to 9, 7, 18
- Node 7: Connected to 6, 10, 14
- Node 10: Connected to 8, 12, 7
- Node 11: Connected to 13, 12, 17
- Node 12: Connected to 10, 11, 15
- Node 13: Connected to 5, 2, 11
- Node 15: Connected to 13, 19, 12
- Node 17: Connected to 5, 8, 19
- Node 18: Connected to 6, 1, 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 7, 18)>
<7, (6, 10, 14)>
<10, (8, 12, 7)>
<11, (13, 12, 17)>
<12, (10, 11, 15)>
<13, (5, 2, 11)>
<15, (13, 19, 12)>
<17, (5, 8, 19)>
<18, (6, 1, 7)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
