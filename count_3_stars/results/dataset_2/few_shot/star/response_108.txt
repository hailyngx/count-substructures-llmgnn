This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3)

Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by locating central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 edges) and their connected nodes (leaves). Let's start by listing the central nodes in the graph:

1. Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 2)
2. Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 9)
3. Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2)
4. Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 9)
5. Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1)
6. Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1)

Now, let's construct the 3-stars for each central node:

1. Central Node 4:
   <4, (8, 6, 2)>
   
2. Central Node 7:
   <7, (0, 6, 9)>
   
3. Central Node 1:
   <1, (3, 6, 2)>
   
4. Central Node 3:
   <3, (1, 0, 9)>
   
5. Central Node 8:
   <8, (4, 7, 1)>
   
6. Central Node 6:
   <6, (4, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
