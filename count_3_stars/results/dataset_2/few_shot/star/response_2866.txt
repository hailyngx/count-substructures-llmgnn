Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can list all the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (3, 6, 2)>
- <1, (5, 7, 3)>
- <2, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 0, 6)>
- <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- <5, (9, 1, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (4, 2, 1)>
- <8, (9, 4, 3)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
