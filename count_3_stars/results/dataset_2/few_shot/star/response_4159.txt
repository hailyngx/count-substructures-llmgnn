Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Counting the number of 3-stars can be done by identifying each node's neighbors and finding nodes that form 3-star configurations with them.

The nodes that have 3 neighbors are: 6, 7, 8, 16, and 18.

1. For Node 6: 
<6, (11, 15, 10)>
<6, (11, 3, 15)>
<6, (11, 15, 6)>
<6, (3, 15, 6)>
<6, (3, 15, 10)>
<6, (15, 3, 6)>
<6, (15, 3, 10)>
<6, (10, 15, 6)>
<6, (10, 15, 3)>
<6, (10, 15, 14)>

2. For Node 7: 
<7, (5, 0, 19)>
<7, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (0, 7, 19)>
<7, (0, 7, 5)>
<7, (19, 7, 5)>
<7, (19, 7, 14)>
<7, (19, 7, 8)>
<7, (14, 7, 5)>
<7, (14, 7, 19)>
<7, (14, 7, 6)>

3. For Node 8: 
<8, (16, 5, 8)>
<8, (16, 5, 8)>
<8, (16, 8, 19)>
<8, (5, 16, 8)>
<8, (5, 16, 8)>
<8, (5, 16, 4)>
<8, (5, 16, 0)>
<8, (8, 16, 5)>
<8, (8, 16, 4)>
<8, (8, 16, 19)>

4. For Node 16: 
<16, (11, 13, 8)>
<16, (11, 13, 5)>
<16, (11, 13, 16)>
<16, (13, 11, 16)>
<16, (13, 11, 8)>
<16, (13, 11, 6)>
<16, (13, 18, 4)>
<16, (8, 13, 4)>
<16, (8, 13, 16)>
<16, (8, 13, 5)>

5. For Node 18: 
<18, (4, 0, 18)>
<18, (4, 0, 12)>
<18, (4, 18, 13)>
<18, (0, 4, 18)>
<18, (0, 4, 12)>
<18, (0, 4, 1)>
<18, (0, 12, 1)>
<18, (0, 12, 4)>
<18, (13, 4, 18)>
<18, (13, 4, 12)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
