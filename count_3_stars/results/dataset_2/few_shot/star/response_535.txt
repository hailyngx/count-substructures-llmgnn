Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Here they are listed inside <>: 
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<3, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 2, 9)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<5, (8, 4, 0)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
