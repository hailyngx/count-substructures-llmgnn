Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 14, making <3, (15, 7, 14)> a 3-star.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 5, making <10, (11, 4, 5)> a 3-star.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 14, making <16, (0, 2, 14)> a 3-star.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 12, making <17, (11, 6, 12)> a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 13, and 19, making <1, (5, 13, 19)> a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [5].
