Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 12, 17, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 13, 15, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 19, 12, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 17, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 13, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 3, and node 19
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 1, 15, 0, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 18, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 2, 16, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 19
Node 14 is connected to node 1, and node 10
Node 15 is connected to node 1, and node 10
Node 16 is connected to node 12
Node 17 is connected to node 18, 19, 0, and node 5
Node 18 is connected to node 11, and node 17
Node 19 is connected to node 9, 13, 2, and node 17

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (10, 12, 17)>
<1, (13, 15, 14)>
<2, (6, 19, 3)>
<10, (8, 1, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
