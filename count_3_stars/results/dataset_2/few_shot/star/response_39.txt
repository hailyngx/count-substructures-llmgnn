Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the potential 3-stars in the graph. The central nodes will have exactly three neighbors since it's a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 10: neighbors 11, 6, 12
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 9, 14
- Node 6: neighbors 10, 5, 14

Now, let's check the connections between the central nodes and their neighbors to confirm the presence of 3-stars.

For Node 10:
- <10, (11, 6, 12)>
- <10, (11, 2, 9)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (2, 9, 14)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (10, 5, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (11, 6, 12)>
<10, (11, 2, 9)>
<6, (10, 5, 14)>
