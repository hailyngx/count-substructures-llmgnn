Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by identifying the 3-stars one by one.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 10)>
<2, (15, 18, 8)>
<3, (0, 13, 18)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (9, 18, 1)>
<6, (8, 17, 14)>
<11, (9, 8, 12)>
<13, (3, 15, 4)>
<18, (5, 2, 14)>
<19, (12, 17, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
