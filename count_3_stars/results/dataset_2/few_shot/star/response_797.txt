Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Observing the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, we can see that a 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph: 

1. <0, (5, 6, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 2)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 6)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 3)>
6. <5, (9, 8, 0)>
7. <6, (5, 4, 1)>
8. <7, (5, 3, 2)>
9. <8, (5, 7, 3)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 2)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
