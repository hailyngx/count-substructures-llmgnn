Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 6, 12, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 11, 6, 12, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 13, 10, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 14, and node 2

Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 12, 1, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 12, 1, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 1, 0, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 13, 10, 0, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 12, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 10, and node 2

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<4, (2, 7, 14)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<10, (1, 12, 14)>
<12, (4, 10, 13)>
<1, (6, 11, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
