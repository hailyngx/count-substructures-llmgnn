Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 14, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 13, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a star) and then count the unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (1, 3, 14)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (11, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 10, 5)>
<13, (1, 10, 5)>
<11, (6, 9, 12)>
<4, (10, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 14, 0)>
<12, (8, 9, 11)>
<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<10, (13, 11, 3)>
<1, (13, 6, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
