Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 12, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<9, (7, 6, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (6, 10, 0)>
<8, (10, 13, 5)>
<13, (7, 9, 8)>
<12, (7, 10, 0)>
<0, (11, 12, 5)>
<1, (4, 0, 13)>
<2, (6, 11, 14)>
<5, (7, 10, 8)>
<3, (9, 8, 3)>
<14, (13, 2, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
