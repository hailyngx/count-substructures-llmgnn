Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 19

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. For Node 0, the 3-stars are:
   - <0, (4, 16, 5)>
   - <0, (4, 16, 9)>
   (2 3-stars for Node 0)

2. For Node 1, the 3-stars are:
   - <1, (18, 12, 14)>
   (1 3-star for Node 1)

3. For Node 2, the 3-stars are:
   - <2, (11, 12, 14)>
   - <2, (9, 12, 14)>
   (2 3-stars for Node 2)

4. For Node 4, the 3-stars are:
   - <4, (8, 13, 0)>
   (1 3-star for Node 4)

5. For Node 5, the 3-stars are:
   - <5, (11, 6, 14)>
   (1 3-star for Node 5)

6. For Node 6, the 3-stars are:
   - <6, (3, 15, 19)>
   (1 3-star for Node 6)

7. For Node 8, the 3-stars are:
   - <8, (13, 14, 4)>
   (1 3-star for Node 8)

8. For Node 9, the 3-stars are:
   - <9, (0, 2, 16)>
   (1 3-star for Node 9)

9. For Node 11, the 3-stars are:
   - <11, (5, 12, 14)>
   (1 3-star for Node 11)

10. For Node 12, the 3-stars are:
    - <12, (11, 2, 1)>
   (1 3-star for Node 12)

11. For Node 13, the 3-stars are:
    - <13, (8, 4, 0)>
   (1 3-star for Node 13)

12. For Node 14, the 3-stars are:
    - <14, (8, 2, 6)>
   (1 3-star for Node 14)

13. For Node 15, the 3-stars are:
    - <15, (19, 18, 6)>
   (1 3-star for Node 15)

14. For Node 16, the 3-stars are:
    - <16, (3, 17, 0)>
   (1 3-star for Node 16)

15. For Node 17, the 3-stars are:
    - <17, (3, 16, 0)>
   (1 3-star for Node 17)

16. For Node 18, the 3-stars are:
    - <18, (15, 19, 1)>
   (1 3-star for Node 18)

17. For Node 19, the 3-stars are:
    - <19, (15, 7, 18)>
   (1 3-star for Node 19)

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
