Response:
The total number of unique 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of ways to choose a central node and then counting the number of ways to choose 3 leaves connected to it. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the number of connections each node has:
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 3 connections
- Node 10 has 3 connections
- Node 11 has 3 connections
- Node 12 has 3 connections
- Node 13 has 4 connections
- Node 14 has 3 connections
- Node 15 has 2 connections
- Node 16 has 3 connections
- Node 17 has 2 connections
- Node 18 has 4 connections
- Node 19 has 2 connections

Now we can count the number of 3-stars by the given connections. 

1. For Node 1:
   - <1, (5, 11, 2)>
   - <1, (5, 11, 10)>

2. For Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (5, 8, 7)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 7)>

3. For Node 5:
   - <5, (9, 1, 15)>
   - <5, (9, 1, 16)>
   - <5, (9, 15, 16)>
   - <5, (1, 15, 16)>

4. For Node 8:
   - <8, (13, 19, 11)>
   - <8, (13, 19, 3)>
   - <8, (13, 11, 3)>
   - <8, (19, 11, 3)>

5. For Node 13:
   - <13, (17, 11, 1)>
   - <13, (17, 11, 10)>
   
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
