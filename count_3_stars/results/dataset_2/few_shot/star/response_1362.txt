Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars. 

Nodes 0 and 6 do not have 3-star configurations since they are not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 12 are potential central nodes for 3-stars since they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. For Node 1:
   - <1, (3, 2, 0)>
   - <1, (3, 2, 7)>
   
2. For Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
   
3. For Node 4:
   - <4, (5, 8, 14)>
   
4. For Node 12:
   - <12, (8, 11, *)> (Note: * represents either 3 or 11 as the third node)

Count of 3-stars: [5]   
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 2, 0)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 14)>
