Response:
First, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

Given that the center of the 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look at each node and count how many 3-stars it is part of. 

Here are the counts for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 2

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 12, x)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (7, 13, x)>
<3, (9, 7, x)>
<3, (9, 11, x)>
<3, (9, 12, x)>
<5, (4, 6, x)>
<5, (4, 10, x)>
<5, (6, 11, x)>
<5, (10, 8, x)>
<5, (11, 14, x)>
<7, (4, 11, x)>
<7, (6, 9, x)>
<7, (9, 12, x)>
<7, (11, 5, x)> 
<9, (7, 1, x)>
<9, (7, 12, x)>
<9, (13, 1, x)>
<11, (9, 3, x)> 
<11, (12, 0, x)> 
<11, (6, 14, x)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
