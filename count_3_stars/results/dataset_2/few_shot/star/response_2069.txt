Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can search for every node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (6, 4, 8)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (6, 10, 7)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (7, 12, 14)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (9, 8, 13)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (10, 11, 13)>
6. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (4, 13, 6)>
7. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 12, 13)>
8. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (3, 2, 13)>
9. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (9, 14, 12)>
10. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (8, 10, 3)>
11. 3-star centered at node 10: <10, (9, 1, 13)>
12. 3-star centered at node 11: <11, (14, 4, 6)>
13. 3-star centered at node 12: <12, (6, 8, 2)>
14. 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (6, 10, 4)>
15. 3-star centered at node 14: <14, (11, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
