Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

1. Node 2 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 16 as leaves. <2, (8, 4, 16)>
2. Node 5 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 8, 13, and 15 as leaves. <5, (8, 13, 15)>
3. Node 13 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 5, 17, and 16 as leaves. <13, (5, 17, 16)>
4. Node 17 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 13, 0, and 15 as leaves. <17, (13, 0, 15)>
5. Node 1 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 14 as leaves. <1, (0, 9, 14)>
6. Node 14 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 1 as leaves. <14, (5, 7, 1)>
7. Node 3 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 0, 10, and 18 as leaves. <3, (0, 10, 18)>
8. Node 11 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 8, 17, and 17 as leaves. <11, (8, 17, 17)>
9. Node 15 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 5, 17, and 19 as leaves. <15, (5, 17, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
