Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. 

Central node: 
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 9, 3, 2, 4, 8, 7

For each neighbor of the central node, we check if it forms a 3-star. 

Checking for node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 1.
- Node 9, (1, 2, 9) forms a 3-star.

Checking for node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 0, and 4.
- Node 3, (1, 5, 3) forms a 3-star.
- Node 3, (1, 4, 3) forms a 3-star.

Checking for node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1.
- Node 2, (1, 6, 2) forms a 3-star.

Checking for node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 4, (1, 6, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 4, (1, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.

Checking for node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 8, (1, 6, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 8, (1, 3, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 8, (1, 4, 8) forms a 3-star.

Checking for node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 0, and 2.
- Node 7, (1, 8, 7) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (1, 4, 3)>
<1, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (1, 6, 4)>
<1, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (1, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
