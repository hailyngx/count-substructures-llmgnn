Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - Starting from each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - If so, the central node and the three connected nodes form a 3-star.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<2, (5, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
