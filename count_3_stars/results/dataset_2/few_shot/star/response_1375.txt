Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 12, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 13, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 14, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 2, 5, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, 13, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 3, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 10, 13, 0, and node 12

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This meets the definition of a 3-star with the selected node as the center. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (9, 12, 5)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 14)>
<4, (10, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 11, 0)>
<6, (9, 14, 3)>
<7, (10, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 14)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (9, 11, 7)>
<11, (6, 10, 5)>
<12, (9, 0, 4)>
<13, (6, 9, 2)>
<14, (6, 3, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] such structures in the given graph.
