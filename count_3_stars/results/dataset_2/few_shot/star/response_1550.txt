Response:
Given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify every set of 3 nodes where one node is the center and it is connected to the other 2 nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (3, 14, 13)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 10, 2)>
<4, (11, 16, 0)>
<5, (3, 2, 18)>
<6, (9, 10, 0)>
<7, (2, 13)>
<8, (17, 12, 18)>
<9, (6, 14, 0)>
<10, (6, 3)>
<11, (19, 4)>
<12, (8, 19, 17)>
<13, (1, 7)>
<14, (9, 1)>
<15, (18, 17)>
<16, (18, 4)>
<17, (8, 5, 12)>
<18, (16, 15, 8)>
<19, (11, 12)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
