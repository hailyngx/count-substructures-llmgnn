Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 0, 3)>
- <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- <9, (6, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
