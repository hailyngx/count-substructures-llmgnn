Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (11, 15, 19)>
2. <1, (6, 10, 14)>
3. <2, (13, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (8, 10, 4)>
5. <4, (16, 17, 2)>
6. <5, (15, 2, 19)>
7. <6, (16, 1, 17)>
8. <7, (12)>
9. <8, (3, 18, 19)>
10. <9, (12)>
11. <10, (1, 3, 18)>
12. <11, (16, 0, 17)>
13. <12, (7, 9, 14)>
14. <13, (2)>
15. <14, (1, 2, 15)>
16. <15, (19, 0, 14)>
17. <16, (11, 17, 6)>
18. <17, (11, 16, 6)>
19. <18, (8, 10, 19)>
20. <19, (16, 18, 15)>

Thus, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
