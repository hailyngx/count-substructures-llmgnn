Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 14, 11, 13, and node 6

Node 2 is connected to node 3, 14, 5, 9, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, and node 13
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 2, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 13, 2, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 12, 2, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 0, 14, 5, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 12, 0, 5, 11, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 0, 11, 6, and node 2

Response:
We will count the number of 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star is formed with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 6, 14)>
<1, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 14, 5)>
<3, (1, 14, 2)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 0, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<10, (8, 12, 2)>
<11, (0, 14, 5)>
<13, (4, 12, 0)>
<14, (3, 0, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
