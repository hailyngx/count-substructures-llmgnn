Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes. 

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
