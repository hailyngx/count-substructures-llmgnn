Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. Then, we identify the three nodes that are connected to this center node.

Here are the 3-stars found in this graph:
[<5, (9, 6, 12)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <10, (9, 11, 13)>, <6, (5, 18, None)>, <4, (9, 2, 18)>, <0, (9, 7, 12)>, <1, (5, 14, 16)>, <8, (9, 16, 17)>, <11, (10, None, None)>, <12, (5, 0, 15)>, <13, (4, 10, 3)>, <14, (1, 15, 13)>, <15, (18, 19, 14)>, <16, (8, 1, None)>, <17, (8, None, None)>, <18, (6, 4, 15)>, <19, (1, 7, 15)>]

So, there are [16] 3-stars in this graph.
