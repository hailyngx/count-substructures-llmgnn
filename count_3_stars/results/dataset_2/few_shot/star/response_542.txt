Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique subgraphs where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will start by listing all possible 3-stars:

- <1, (5, 17, 3)>
- <1, (5, 17, 6)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <1, (17, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 18, 12)>
- <2, (1, 18, 8)>
- <2, (1, 12, 8)>
- <2, (18, 12, 8)>
- <3, (14, 1, 5)>
- <6, (16, 1, 7)>
- <8, (14, 7, 13)>
- <8, (7, 6, 11)>
- <8, (18, 12, 8)>

Now, let's count how many unique 3-stars we found to get the final answer:

[12]
