Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 18, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 19)>
<0, (6, 2, 4)>
<2, (18, 0, 15)>
<7, (13, 1, 19)>
<8, (9, 19, 5)>
<1, (7, 11, 10)>
<3, (19, 14, 16)>
<4, (0, 15, 17)>
<15, (18, 0, 4)>
<10, (12, 1, 16)>
<13, (18, 7, 19)>
<16, (9, 17, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
