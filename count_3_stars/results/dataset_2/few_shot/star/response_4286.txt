Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes:
   - Node 0 has three edges connecting it to nodes 4, 7, and 11.
   - Node 1 has three edges connecting it to nodes 4 and 9.
   - Node 3 has three edges connecting it to nodes 10 and 6.
   - Node 5 has only one edge connecting it to node 4, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 10 has only two edges connecting it to nodes 3 and 8, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 12 has only two edges connecting it to nodes 8 and 14, so it does not form a 3-star.

2. For each node identified in step 1, find the three-star centered at that node:
   - For node 0: <0, (4, 7, 11)>
   - For node 1: <1, (4, 9, 7)>
   - For node 3: <3, (10, 6, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (4, 7, 11)>, <1, (4, 9, 7)>, <3, (10, 6, 2)>
