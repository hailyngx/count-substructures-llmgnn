Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify all such structures by examining each node and its adjacent nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars: 
1. Central Node: 1, Leaves: 7, 13, 9
2. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 11, 7, 12
3. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 11, 12, 5
4. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 5, 14, 0
5. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 13, 8, 4
6. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 10, 2, 13
7. Central Node: 7, Leaves: 12, 2, 13
8. Central Node: 8, Leaves: 10, 7, 5
9. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 10, 12, 8
10. Central Node: 10, Leaves: 11, 6, 8
11. Central Node: 11, Leaves: 10, 3, 14
12. Central Node: 12, Leaves: 7, 2, 14
13. Central Node: 13, Leaves: 7, 5, 6
14. Central Node: 14, Leaves: 11, 12, 8

So, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (7, 13, 9)>
<2, (11, 7, 12)>
<3, (11, 12, 5)>
<4, (5, 14, 0)>
<5, (13, 8, 4)>
<6, (10, 2, 13)>
<7, (12, 2, 13)>
<8, (10, 7, 5)>
<9, (10, 12, 8)>
<10, (11, 3, 14)>
<11, (7, 2, 12)>
<12, (7, 5, 13)>
<13, (11, 14, 10)>
<14, (12, 14, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
