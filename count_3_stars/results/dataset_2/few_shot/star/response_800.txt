Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

First, let's identify the 3-stars using the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes: 5, 9, 13. <0, (5, 9, 13)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes: 2, 13, 12. <1, (2, 13, 12)>
- Node 2 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes: 5, 9, 11. <4, (5, 9, 11)>
- Node 5 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes: 4, 10, 2. <7, (4, 10, 2)>
- Node 8 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 10 forms 3-stars with nodes: 5, 9, 14. <10, (5, 9, 14)>
- Node 11 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 12 doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes: 1, 0, 11. <13, (1, 0, 11)>
- Node 14 doesn't form any 3-stars.

Now, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (2, 13, 12)>, <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <7, (4, 10, 2)>, <10, (5, 9, 14)>, <13, (1, 0, 11)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
