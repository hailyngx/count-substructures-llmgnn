Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (9, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (8, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
