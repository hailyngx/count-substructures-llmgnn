Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 0, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 2 other nodes.
- For Node 1, <1, (3, 9, 13)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 2, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 3 other nodes.
- For Node 3, <3, (1, 7, 14)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 4, <4, (8, 9, 13)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 5, <5, (1, 7, 14)> and <5, (2, 6, 14)> are 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 3 other nodes.
- For Node 7, <7, (3, 5, 12)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 8, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 3 other nodes.
- For Node 9, <9, (1, 4, 12)> and <9, (4, 14, 13)> are 3-stars.
- For Node 10, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 3 other nodes.
- For Node 11, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 2 other nodes.
- For Node 12, <12, (3, 7, 14)> and <12, (2, 9, 14)> are 3-stars.
- For Node 13, there are no 3-stars. It is connected to 2 other nodes.
- For Node 14, <14, (3, 4, 8)> and <14, (5, 9, 12)> are 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 9, 13)>, <3, (1, 7, 14)>, <4, (8, 9, 13)>, <5, (1, 7, 14)>, <5, (2, 6, 14)>, <7, (3, 5, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 12)>, <9, (4, 14, 13)>, <12, (3, 7, 14)>, and <12, (2, 9, 14)>.
