Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (connected to 13, 7, 10)
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 17, 15)
- Node 12 (connected to 5, 0, 2)
- Node 16 (connected to 6, 12, 19)
- Node 18 (connected to 1, 9, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 7, 10 <0, (13, 7, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 17, 15 <6, (1, 17, 15)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 0, 2 <12, (5, 0, 2)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 12, 19 <16, (6, 12, 19)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 9, 3 <18, (1, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
