Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 12. <5, (9, 13, 12)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 14. <13, (5, 6, 14)>
4. Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4. <12, (5, 9, 4)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 10. <7, (5, 4, 10)>
6. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 10. <0, (4, 8, 10)>
7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 11. <2, (8, 10, 11)>
8. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 13. <6, (9, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
