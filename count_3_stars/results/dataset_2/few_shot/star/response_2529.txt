Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

First, let's determine the central node of each 3-star. Then, we will list the leaves connected to each central node.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<5, (9, 8, 11)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (8, 11, 14)>
<4, (6, 14, 13)>
<7, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (14, 3, 11)>
<3, (0, 10)>
<11, (5, 9, 0)>
<12, (5, 13, 10)>
<1, (6, 7, 13)>
<2, (6, 0, 10)>
<13, (6, 7, 14)>
<10, (3, 12, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
