Response:
Let's first identify the nodes which have exactly three edges connected to them, making them potential centers of 3-stars. These nodes are: 1, 12, and 14.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each potential center node:
- For node 1: Since node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 2, 0, 14, and 9, we have one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (11, 2, 9)>.
- For node 12: Since node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 2, 14, and 1, we have one 3-star with node 12 as the center: <12, (8, 4, 2)>.
- For node 14: Since node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 12, 3, 7, and 1, we have one 3-star with node 14 as the center: <14, (4, 5, 3)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (11, 2, 9)>  
<12, (8, 4, 2)>  
<14, (4, 5, 3)>
