Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-star structures in the given graph. To identify a 3-star, we need to locate all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (2, 5, 0)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Overall, we have found three unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
