Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These nodes will have exactly 3 neighbors in the graph. From the given adjacency list, the potential central nodes are: 5, 9, and 14.

Now, let's list all the 3-stars:

<5, (13, 1, 10)>
<9, (2, 12, 10)>
<14, (7, 4, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
