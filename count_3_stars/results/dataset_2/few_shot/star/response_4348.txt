Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. From node 5:
   - Possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>

2. From node 9:
   - Possible 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

3. From node 6:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 3 nodes.

4. From node 4:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.

5. From node 7:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.

6. From node 1:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

7. From node 3:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 4 nodes.

8. From node 8:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 5 nodes.

9. From node 2:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 3 nodes.

10. From node 0:
   - No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to 3 nodes.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
