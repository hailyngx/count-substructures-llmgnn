Response:
The 3-star graph is characterized by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's count the number of such 3-stars in the graph given.

Let's analyze each node to see if it's the center of a 3-star. Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 18, 28)>
<2, (21, 22, 28)>
<6, (4, 18, 28)>
<16, (3, 26, 27)>
<26, (12, 20, 16)>

Since the above 3-stars are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
