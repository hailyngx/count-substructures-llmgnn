Response:
We have a total of 20 nodes in the graph. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we have found a 3-star.
2. List all the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (14, 19, 3)>
<9, (0, 13, 16)>
<16, (12, 15, 10)>
