Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all unique combinations of 3 nodes attached to each central node.  

Calculating the 3-stars for each central node:
- 3-stars for Node 0: <0, (9, 7, 10)>, <0, (9, 7, 11)>, <0, (9, 10, 11)>, <0, (7, 10, 11)>
- 3-stars for Node 1: <1, (6, 4, 11)>, <1, (6, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 4, 14)>, <1, (6, 11, 5)>, <1, (6, 11, 14)>, <1, (6, 5, 14)>, <1, (4, 11, 5)>, <1, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 5, 14)>, <1, (11, 5, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 2: <2, (4, 8, 7)>
- 3-stars for Node 3: <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 14)>, <3, (6, 5, 14)>, <3, (9, 5, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 4: <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 12)>, <4, (7, 1, 14)>, <4, (7, 2, 12)>, <4, (7, 2, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <4, (1, 2, 12)>, <4, (1, 2, 14)>, <4, (1, 12, 14)>, <4, (2, 12, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 5: <5, (13, 1, 14)>, <5, (13, 3, 14)>, <5, (13, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 3)>
- 3-stars for Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 13)>, <7, (0, 8, 13)>
- 3-stars for Node 8: <8, (7, 13, 2)>
- 3-stars for Node 9: <9, (6, 1, 3)>, <9, (6, 3, 5)>, <9, (6, 3, 14)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 14)>, <9, (3, 5, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 10: <10, (11, 0, 14)>
- 3-stars for Node 11: <11, (1, 0, 13)>, <11, (1, 0, 12)>, <11, (0, 13, 12)>
- 3-stars for Node 12: <12, (4, 11, 5)>
- 3-stars for Node 13: <13, (9, 11, 5)>, <13, (9, 11, 8)>, <13, (9, 5, 8)>, <13, (11, 5, 8)>
- 3-stars for Node 14: <14, (4, 10, 5)>, <14, (4, 10, 1)>, <14, (4, 5, 1)>, <14, (10, 5, 1)>, <14, (10, 5, 3)>, <14, (10, 1, 3)>, <14, (5, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].
