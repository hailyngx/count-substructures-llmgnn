Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can see that the following 3-stars exist in the graph:
<0, (27, 11, 8)>
<3, (25, 24, 18)>
<25, (3, 23, 9)>
<8, (0, 18, 16)>
<23, (25, 13, 8)>
<7, (12, 22, 9)>
<12, (8, 16, 7)>
<22, (7)>
<9, (0, 25, 7)>
<20, (29, 2, 6)>
<29, (20, 13, 15)>
<11, (0, 26, 21)>
<13, (23, 29, 24)>
<5, (27, 4, 18)>
<6, (20, 2)>
<10, (16, 13)>
<17, (4, 2)>
<18, (3, 8, 16)>
<14, (9, 19)>
<15, (29)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [19].
