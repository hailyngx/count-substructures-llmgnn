Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (5, 7, 3)>
- From node 1: <1, (9, 0, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 9, 4)>
- From node 3: <3, (5, 4, 8)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 3, 6)>
- From node 5: <5, (9, 2, 0)>
- From node 6: <6, (4, 0, 3)>
- From node 7: <7, (9, 8, 0)>
- From node 8: <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
