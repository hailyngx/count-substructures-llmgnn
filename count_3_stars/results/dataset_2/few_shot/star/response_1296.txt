Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (7, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (7, 6, 1)>
