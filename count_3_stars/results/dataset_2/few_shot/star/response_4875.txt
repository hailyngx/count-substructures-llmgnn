Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 10, 17)>
<7, (4, 11, 10)>
<10, (4, 13, 7)>
<12, (5, 6, 3)>
<13, (0, 19, 11)>
<14, (18, 16, 13)>
<17, (4, 2, 5)>
<19, (4, 13, 0)>

There are [8] unique 3-stars in the graph.
