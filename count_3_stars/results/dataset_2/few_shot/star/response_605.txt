Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will look for these patterns and then count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly three connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 8, 3, 4)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 12, 13)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 11, 7, 3)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 14, 0, 7)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 13)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 11, 13)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 9, 2, 3)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 2)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars. 

<0, (8, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 12, 13)>
<6, (11, 7, 3)>
<8, (14, 0, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (11, 13)>
<12, (9, 2, 3)>
<14, (5, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
