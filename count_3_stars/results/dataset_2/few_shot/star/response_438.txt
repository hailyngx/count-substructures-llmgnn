Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (8, 5, 1)>
<1, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (4, 8, 5)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [10].
