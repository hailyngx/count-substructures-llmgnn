Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Starting from the given information, let's identify the 3-star graphs present in the given graph:

- For Node 0: <0, (9, 7, 6)>
- For Node 1: <1, (4, 3, 6)>
- For Node 3: <3, (7, 1, 6)>
- For Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- For Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 7)>
- For Node 6: <6, (5, 4, 1)>
- For Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- For Node 9: <9, (5, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
