Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to first identify all possible 3-stars by examining all nodes and their connections.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (12, 9, 13)>
<2, (6, 9, 10)>
<3, (8, 11, 14)>
<4, (7, 12, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 2, 11)>
<10, (5, 2, 12)>
<11, (3, 14, 13)>
<12, (4, 5, 3)>
<13, (6, 2, 11)>
<14, (4, 3, 11)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
