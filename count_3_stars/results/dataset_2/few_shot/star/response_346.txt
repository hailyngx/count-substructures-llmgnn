Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-star graphs found in the graph:
<0, (27, 20, 3)>
<1, (4, 23, 15)>
<2, (10, 26, 17)>
<3, (0, 27, 13)>
<4, (7, 1, 16)>
<5, (22, 23, 6)>
<6, (22, 13, 29)>
<7, (4, 12, 28)>
<8, (20, 12, 1)>
<9, (17, 28, 14)>
<10, (11, 26, 2)>
<11, (16, 10, 13)>
<12, (7, 23, 29)>
<13, (16, 1, 3)>
<14, (19, 15, 9)>
<15, (1, 14, 21)>
<16, (11, 13, 1)>
<17, (19, 26, 21)>
<18, (0)>
<19, (20, 17, 14)>
<20, (0, 27, 1)>
<21, (15, 17, 24)>
<22, (23, 6, 25)>
<23, (22, 5, 1)>
<24, (21)>
<25, (22, 6)>
<26, (10, 2, 17)>
<27, (0, 3)>
<28, (7, 10, 9)>
<29, (12, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [29].
<0, (27, 20, 3)>, <1, (4, 23, 15)>, <2, (10, 26, 17)>, <3, (0, 27, 13)>, <4, (7, 1, 16)>, <5, (22, 23, 6)>,
<6, (22, 13, 29)>, <7, (4, 12, 28)>, <8, (20, 12, 1)>, <9, (17, 28, 14)>, <10, (11, 26, 2)>, <11, (16, 10, 13)>,
<12, (7, 23, 29)>, <13, (16, 1, 3)>, <14, (19, 15, 9)>, <15, (1, 14, 21)>, <16, (11, 13, 1)>, <17, (19, 26, 21)>,
<18, (0)>, <19, (20, 17, 14)>, <20, (0, 27, 1)>, <21, (15, 17, 24)>, <22, (23, 6, 25)>, <23, (22, 5, 1)>,
<24, (21)>, <25, (22, 6)>, <26, (10, 2, 17)>, <27, (0, 3)>, <28, (7, 10, 9)>, <29, (12, 6)>
