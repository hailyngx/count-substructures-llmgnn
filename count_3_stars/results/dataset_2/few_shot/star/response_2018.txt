Response:
Let's start by analyzing the neighbors of each node.

Node 0: (26), (13)
Node 1: (11), (7), (12)
Node 2: (29), (5), (13), (21), (11)
Node 3: (25), (9), (5)
Node 4: (17), (15), (5), (11)
Node 5: (3), (2), (12), (23), (4)
Node 6: (14), (22)
Node 7: (17), (20), (1)
Node 8: (25), (11), (21), (22)
Node 9: (3), (27)
Node 10: (14), (20)
Node 11: (17), (2), (1), (8), (4)
Node 12: (1), (5), (21)
Node 13: (2), (0), (19)
Node 14: (17), (6), (27), (10)
Node 15: (19), (4)
Node 16: (17), (24)
Node 17: (14), (16), (11), (4), (7)
Node 18: (24), (27)
Node 19: (24), (15), (13)
Node 20: (7), (10)
Node 21: (2), (12), (23), (8)
Node 22: (28), (6), (8)
Node 23: (5), (21)
Node 24: (16), (18), (19)
Node 25: (3), (27), (8)
Node 26: (0)
Node 27: (14), (25), (28), (18), (9)
Node 28: (22), (27)
Node 29: (2)

After analyzing the neighbors, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:

<4, (17, 11, 5)>
<5, (12, 21, 2)>
<8, (11, 21, 25)>
<13, (0, 19, 2)>
<15, (4, 19, 24)>
<17, (7, 16, 14)>
<18, (27, 24, 18)>
<19, (13, 15, 24)>
<22, (6, 8, 28)>
<23, (5, 8, 21)>
<25, (9, 3, 27)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
