Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. From the adjacency list, we can see that each node is connected to exactly 5 other nodes.
2. For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
3. If we look at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 0)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>

So, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
