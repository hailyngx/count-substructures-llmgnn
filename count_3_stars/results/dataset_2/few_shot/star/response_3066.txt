Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-star graphs in this given graph:

1. <0, (3, 16, 14)>
2. <1, (10, 19, 2)>
3. <2, (19, 1, 18)>
4. <3, (15, 0, 13)>
5. <7, (16, 11, 14)>
6. <9, (0, 4, 11)>
7. <11, (7, 9, 13)>
8. <12, (3, 10, 8)>
9. <13, (3, 14, 18)>
10. <15, (3, 10, 17)>
11. <16, (7, 0, 17)>
12. <17, (15, 11, 9)>
13. <18, (19, 13, 8)>
14. <19, (18, 8, 1)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
