Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find all the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: <0, (11, 13, 4)>
- For Node 1: <1, (6, 12, 8)>
- For Node 2: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 3: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 4: <4, (6, 0, 14)>
- For Node 5: <5, (13, 8, 7)>
- For Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 10)>
- For Node 7: <7, (9, 10, 5)>
- For Node 8: <8, (10, 5, 1)>
- For Node 9: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 10: <10, (6, 11, 8)>
- For Node 11: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 12: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 13: No 3-star exists.
- For Node 14: <14, (5, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (11, 13, 4)>, <4, (6, 0, 14)>, <5, (13, 8, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 10)>, <7, (9, 10, 5)>, and <8, (10, 5, 1)>.
