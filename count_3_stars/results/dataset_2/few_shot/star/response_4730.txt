Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

1. Node 1: {5, 9, 11, 12, 2}
2. Node 3: {5, 6, 11, 10, 2}
3. Node 7: {0, 11, 6, 8}
4. Node 9: {5, 4, 1, 12}
5. Node 12: {9, 4, 2, 10, 14}
6. Node 13: {8, 11, 14}

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 9, 11, 12, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 11, 10, 2)>
<7, (0, 11, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 1, 12)>
<12, (9, 4, 2, 10, 14)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
