Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 3. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 0.
- For Node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 12. However, Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
- For Node 2: Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 2.
- For Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 0. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 3.
- For Node 4: Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 4.
- For Node 5: Node 5 is connected to nodes 9 and 6. However, Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
- For Node 6: Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 13. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 6.
- For Node 7: Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 7.
- For Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 11. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 8.
- For Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 2. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 9.
- For Node 10: Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 14. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 10.
- For Node 11: Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 12. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 11.
- For Node 12: Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 10. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 12.
- For Node 13: Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 3. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 13.
- For Node 14: Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 6. So, there is a 3-star centered at Node 14.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 13, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 8, 13)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<8, (13, 14, 11)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<10, (13, 12, 14)>
<11, (8, 14, 12)>
<12, (3, 11, 10)>
<13, (8, 2, 3)>
<14, (4, 8, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
