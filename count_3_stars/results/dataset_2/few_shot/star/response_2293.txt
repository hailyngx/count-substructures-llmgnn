Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Before listing the 3-stars, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: (7, 2, 1)
- Node 1: (5, 4, 0)
- Node 2: (5, 7, 0, 3)
- Node 3: (5, 9, 6, 8, 2)
- Node 4: (7, 1, 6)
- Node 5: (9, 2, 1, 3)
- Node 6: (9, 4, 7, 3, 8)
- Node 7: (9, 4, 0, 6, 2)
- Node 8: (9, 6, 3)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 8, 3, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<0, (7, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The final answer is [10].
