Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the only way for a node to be the center of a 3-star is if it has exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 7, 12)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 5, 14)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 5, 15)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 8, 11)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 10, 6)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 1, 12)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (7, 12)>
<2, (5, 14)>
<4, (5, 15)>
<13, (8, 11)>
<18, (10, 6)>
<19, (1, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
