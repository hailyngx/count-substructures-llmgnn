Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (7, 13, 6)>
- <5, (7, 8, 13)>
- <8, (1, 10, 11)>
- <9, (3, 10, 13)>
- <10, (6, 8, 9)>
- <12, (7, 3, _)>
- <13, (4, 8, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified ones:
