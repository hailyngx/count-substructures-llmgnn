The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 9, 4, 12, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 12, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 13, 12, 2, and node 10
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 0, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 1, 2, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 10, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 9, 3, and node 7

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's identify and count them one by one.

1. <0, (6, 4, 12)> 
2. <1, (6, 2, 9)> 
3. <2, (5, 6, 3)> 
4. <3, (6, 13, 12)> 
5. <4, (12, 0, 14)> 
6. <5, (6, 2, 8)> 
7. <6, (5, 1, 3)> 
8. <7, (8, 1, 10)> 
9. <8, (5, 0, 7)> 
10. <9, (2, 10, 1)> 
11. <10, (13, 9, 3)> 
12. <11, (4, 0, 11)> 
13. <12, (13, 4, 0)> 
14. <13, (12, 3, 10)> 
15. <14, (4)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
