Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we'll look for nodes that have degree 3 in the graph. 

Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes with degree 3 are 11, 17, and 19. 

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node:

- For node 11: Nodes 16, 9, and 17
- For node 17: Nodes 16, 0, and 12
- For node 19: Nodes 4, 5, and 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars with the identified central nodes and leaves.

1. For central node 11:
   <11, (16, 9, 17)>
2. For central node 17:
   <17, (16, 0, 12)>
3. For central node 19:
   <19, (4, 5, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
