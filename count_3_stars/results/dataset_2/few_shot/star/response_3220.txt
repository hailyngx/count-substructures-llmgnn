Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step by step:

1. Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 
   - Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 14, and no other)
   - Node 13 (connected to nodes 7, 6, 8, and 10)

2. For Node 9, the 3-star can be formed by considering node 9 as the center:
   <9, (4, 14, x)> where x represents the last node.

3. For Node 13, it can be the center of two 3-stars:
   <13, (7, 6, 8)>
   <13, (7, 10,  x)> where x represents the last node.

Therefore, the total number of different 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (4, 14, x)>
<13, (7, 6, 8)>
<13, (7, 10, x)>
