Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 9, 1)>
2. <0, (6, 4, 5)>
3. <0, (6, 1, 9)>
4. <0, (6, 4, 9)>
5. <0, (9, 4, 2)>
6. <0, (9, 4, 6)>
7. <1, (3, 2, 0)>
8. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
9. <2, (9, 1, 4)>
10. <2, (9, 4, 8)>
11. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
12. <3, (1, 4, 0)>
13. <4, (9, 2, 8)>
14. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
15. <6, (9, 3, 4)>
16. <7, (6, 9, 8)>
17. <8, (3, 4, 2)>
18. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
19. <9, (6, 4, 2)>
20. <9, (6, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
