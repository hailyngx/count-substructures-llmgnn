Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are only connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, nodes with exactly three connections are:
- Node 4: connected to node 11
- Node 10: connected to node 2
- Node 14: connected to node 6
- Node 15: connected to node 7

Step 2: For each identified node, create a 3-star graph.
- For Node 4: <4, (11, x, x)>, where x represents any node other than the central node and its direct connection.
- For Node 10: <10, (2, x, x)>, where x represents any node other than the central node and its direct connection.
- For Node 14: <14, (6, x, x)>, where x represents any node other than the central node and its direct connection.
- For Node 15: <15, (7, x, x)>, where x represents any node other than the central node and its direct connection.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-star graphs created.
- The unique 3-star graphs are: 
<4, (11, x, x)>, 
<10, (2, x, x)>, 
<14, (6, x, x)>,
<15, (7, x, x)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
