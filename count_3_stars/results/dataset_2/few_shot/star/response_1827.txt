Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 2, 6)>
<0, (7, 4, 1)>
<0, (7, 6, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (8, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 1)>
<4, (8, 7, 1)>
<4, (8, 3, 6)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-star structures: [16]
