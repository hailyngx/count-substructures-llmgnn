Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes since a 3-star graph has its center connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes and their adjacent nodes are:
- Node 0: (11, 12, 5), (11, 12, 9), (11, 12, 2), (11, 5, 9), (11, 5, 2), (11, 9, 2), (12, 5, 9), (12, 5, 2), (12, 9, 2), (5, 9, 2) - Total: 10 combinations
- Node 2: (7, 6, 12), (7, 6, 14), (7, 12, 14), (6, 12, 14) - Total: 4 combinations
- Node 3: (13, 5, 12) - Total: 1 combination
- Node 4: (7, 8, 11), (7, 8, 12), (7, 11, 12), (8, 11, 12) - Total: 4 combinations
- Node 5: (3, 10, 12), (3, 12, 14), (10, 12, 14) - Total: 3 combinations
- Node 6: (7, 1, 2) - Total: 1 combination
- Node 7: (14, 2, 4) - Total: 1 combination
- Node 9: (4, 10, 1), (4, 10, 13), (4, 1, 13), (10, 1, 13) - Total: 4 combinations
- Node 13: (10, 14, 5) - Total: 1 combination

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Total 3-stars = 10 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 3 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 9) + 1 (from Node 13) = 29

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (11, 12, 5)>
<0, (11, 12, 9)>
<0, (11, 12, 2)>
<0, (11, 5, 9)>
<0, (11, 5, 2)>
<0, (11, 9, 2)>
<0, (12, 5, 9)>
<0, (12, 5, 2)>
<0, (12, 9, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 12)>
<2, (7, 6, 14)>
<2, (7, 12, 14)>
<2, (6, 12, 14)>
<3, (13, 5, 12)>
<4, (7, 8, 11)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<4, (7, 11, 12)>
<4, (8, 11, 12)>
<5, (3, 10, 12)>
<5, (3, 12, 14)>
<5, (10, 12, 14)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (14, 2, 4)>
<9, (4, 10, 1)>

<9, (4, 1, 13)>
<9, (10, 1, 13)>
<13, (10, 14, 5)>
