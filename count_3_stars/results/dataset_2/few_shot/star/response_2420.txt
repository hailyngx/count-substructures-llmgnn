Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the following nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 11, 19, and 2 itself.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 11, 7, and 10.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 17, 19, and 7.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8, 12, and 15.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 15.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 16, 3, and 4.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 11, 4, and 10.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 8, 13, and 15.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 17, 13, and 5.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (11, 19, 2)>
<3, (11, 7, 10)>
<5, (17, 19, 7)>
<6, (8, 12, 15)>
<10, (16, 3, 4)>
<12, (1, 6, 9)>
<16, (11, 4, 10)>
<18, (8, 13, 15)>
<19, (17, 13, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
