Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by examining each node that satisfies the condition of being the center of a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node and check which nodes are connected to it:

- Node 0 has three neighbors: 25, 17, and 26.
  - <0, (25, 17, 26)>
- Node 1 has two neighbors: 26.
- Node 2 has three neighbors: 27, 19, and 0.
  - <2, (27, 19, 0)>
- Node 3 has two neighbors: 27.
- Node 4 has one neighbor: 16.
- Node 5 has three neighbors: 28, 13, and 22.
  - <5, (28, 13, 22)>
- Node 6 has four neighbors: 28, 24, 22, and 12.
  - <6, (28, 24, 22)>
- Node 7 has four neighbors: 21, 14, 26, and 8.
  - <7, (21,14,26)>
- Node 8 has two neighbors: 7.
- Node 9 has one neighbor: 21.
- Node 10 has two neighbors: 17 and 23.
- Node 11 has three neighbors: 20, 17, and 18.
  - <11, (20, 17, 18)>
- Node 12 has four neighbors: 15, 28, 6, and 14.
  - <12, (15, 28, 6)>
- Node 13 has three neighbors: 25, 5, and 24.
  - <13, (25, 5, 24)>
- Node 14 has two neighbors: 7.
- Node 15 has three neighbors: 22, 12, and 28.
  - <15, (22, 12, 28)>
- Node 16 has two neighbors: 26.
- Node 17 has four neighbors: 10, 0, 26, and 11.
  - <17, (10, 0, 11)>
- Node 18 has three neighbors: 29, 24, and 11.
  - <18, (29, 24, 11)>
- Node 19 has three neighbors: 29, 2, and 23.
  - <19, (29, 2, 23)>
- Node 20 has four neighbors: 25, 3, 8, and 11.
  - <20, (25, 3, 8)>
- Node 21 has two neighbors: 7.
- Node 22 has five neighbors: 15, 1, 29, 6, and 5.
  - <22, (15, 1, 29)>
- Node 23 has two neighbors: 10 and 19.
- Node 24 has three neighbors: 6, 13, and 18.
  - <24, (6, 13, 18)>
- Node 25 has three neighbors: 20, 13, and 0.
  - <25, (20, 13, 0)>
- Node 26 has five neighbors: 7, 17, 1, 16, and 0.
  - <26, (7, 17, 1)>
- Node 27 has two neighbors: 2 and 3.
- Node 28 has five neighbors: 15, 29, 6, 12, and 5.
  - <28, (15, 29, 6)>
- Node 29 has four neighbors: 28, 19, 22, and 18.
  - <29, (28, 19, 22)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is simply the number of unique 3-stars found, which is 13. 
So, the answer is [13].
