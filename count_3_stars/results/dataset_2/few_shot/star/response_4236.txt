Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (6, 0, 14)>
<2, (6, 14, 11)>
<3, (9, 12, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 10)>
<5, (6, 11, 7)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<7, (14, 5, 12)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 5, 1)>
<10, (8, 4, 10)>
<11, (9, 5, 7)>
<12, (14, 7, 3)>
<13, (7, 10, 13)>
<14, (0, 1, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
