Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (9, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (9, 4, 6)>

2. For node 1:
   - No 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (5, 9, 3)>
   - <2, (5, 9, 6)>
   - <2, (5, 3, 6)>

4. For node 3:
   - <3, (9, 6, 2)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 8)>
   - <3, (9, 2, 8)>

5. For node 4:
   - <4, (5, 7, 0)>
   - <4, (5, 7, 1)>
   - <4, (5, 0, 1)>

6. For node 5:
   - <5, (9, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (9, 4, 7)>
   - <5, (9, 4, 0)>

7. For node 6:
   - <6, (3, 8, 0)>
   - <6, (3, 8, 2)>
   - <6, (3, 0, 2)>

8. For node 7:
   - <7, (5, 4, 0)>
   - <7, (5, 4, 1)>
   - <7, (5, 0, 1)>

9. For node 8:
   - <8, (5, 7, 3)>
   - <8, (5, 7, 6)>
   - <8, (5, 3, 6)>

10. For node 9:
   - <9, (5, 2, 3)>
   - <9, (5, 2, 6)>
   - <9, (5, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
