Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<2, (7, 1, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
