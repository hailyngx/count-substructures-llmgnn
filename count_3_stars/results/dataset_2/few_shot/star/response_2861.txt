Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes with exactly three neighbors and consider each of them as the center of a 3-star. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 5 is connected to node 17.
   - Node 9 is connected to node 11.
   - Node 18 is connected to node 16 and 0.
   
2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   <5, (17, x, x)>
   <9, (11, x, x)>
   <18, (16, 0, x)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
   There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [3].

So, the final answer is [3].
