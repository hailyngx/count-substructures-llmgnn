Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:

<4, (8, 0, 6)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<1, (3)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
