Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the central node.

Here are the 3-star patterns found in the graph:

<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 0, 19)>
<2, (0, 8, 15)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (3, 17, -)>
<5, (9, 15, 0)>
<6, (13, - , -)>
<7, (2, 8, 19)>
<8, (10, 17, 2)>
<9, (5, 15, 17)>
<10, (11, 18, 8)>
<11, (16, 14, 10)>
<12, (19, 18, 9)>
<13, (6, - , -)>
<14, (16, 11, 18)>
<15, (5, 9, 2)>
<16, (11, 14, -)>
<17, (9, 8, 4)>
<18, (11, 10, 12)>
<19, (7, 1, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
