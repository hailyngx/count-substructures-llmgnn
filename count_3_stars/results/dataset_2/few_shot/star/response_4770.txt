Response:
We will determine the 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central node and the three other nodes it is connected to. Let's go through the nodes one by one and find all the possible 3-stars.

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (9, 13, 10)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (13, 11, 14)>
   
3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (9, 3, 11)>
   - <2, (14, 3, 1)>
   
4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 3 because it has less than three connections.
   
5. For Node 4:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 4 because it has less than three connections.
   
6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 5 because it has less than three connections.
   
7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 6 because there are only four edges leaving this node.
   
8. For Node 7:
   - <7, (6, 8, 14)>
   
9. For Node 8:
   - <8, (13, 4, 7)>
   
10. For Node 9:
   - <9, (2, 11, 14)>
   
11. For Node 10:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 10 because it has less than three connections.
   
12. For Node 11:
   - No new 3-stars can be found centered at Node 11 as they have already been covered before.
   
13. For Node 12:
   - <12, (6, 9, 8)>
   
14. For Node 13:
   - No new 3-stars can be found centered at Node 13 as they have already been covered before.
   
15. For Node 14:
   - No new 3-stars can be found centered at Node 14 as they have already been covered before.
   
[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.]
   
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (9, 13, 10)>, <1, (13, 11, 14)>, <2, (9, 3, 11)>, <2, (14, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 8, 14)>, <12, (6, 9, 8)>.
