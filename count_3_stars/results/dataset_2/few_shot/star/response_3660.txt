Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes for the 3-stars can be nodes 4, 7, 13, 14, and 16. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node.

For node 4:
- (4, 7, 14)
- (4, 7, 9)
- (4, 9, 14)
- (4, 7, 12)

For node 7:
- (7, 4, 14)
- (7, 4, 16)
- (7, 16, 14)
- (7, 4, 3)

For node 13:
- (13, 5, 17)
- (13, 5, 2)
- (13, 17, 2)

For node 14:
- (14, 4, 18)
- (14, 4, 16)
- (14, 18, 16)

For node 16:
- (16, 7, 9)
- (16, 7, 14)
- (16, 9, 14)

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
