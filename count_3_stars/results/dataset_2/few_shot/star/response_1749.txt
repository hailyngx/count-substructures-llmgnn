Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the edge list, we see that the potential central nodes are: 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18.
2. From the adjacency list, we can confirm that these potential central nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
3. By checking the connections of these central nodes, we can identify the 3-stars:

Identified 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 13)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 15)>
<11, (10, 7, 13)>
<13, (5, 11, 17)>
<15, (10, 7, 4)>
<18, (5, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. Inside brackets, the number of 3-stars is 7.
