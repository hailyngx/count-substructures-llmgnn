Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of ways a node can be the center node for a 3-star. Since each 3-star has 1 center node and 3 leaf nodes, we need to find the nodes with at least 3 neighbors. Let's list those nodes and the nodes they are connected to:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 16, and 14
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 17, 2, 3, and 19
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 18, 11, 12, 19, and 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For Node 5:
- <5, (9, 1, 16)>
- <5, (9, 1, 14)>
- <5, (9, 16, 14)>

For Node 13:
- <13, (8, 2, 3)>
- <13, (8, 2, 19)>
- <13, (8, 3, 19)>
- <13, (2, 3, 19)>

For Node 15:
- <15, (18, 12, 19)>
- <15, (18, 11, 19)>
- <15, (18, 19, 14)>
- <15, (11, 12, 14)>
- <15, (11, 12, 19)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
