Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges in the context of this graph.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[16]

Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
