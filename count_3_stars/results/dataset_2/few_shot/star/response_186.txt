Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

We can see that the central node of a 3-star can be connected to the other three nodes in 4 ways. We will need to count each unique 3-star that can be formed in this graph.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. For `Node 0`:
   - <0, (9, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (9, 1, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 6, 8)>

2. For `Node 1`:
   - <1, (9, 4, 0)>
   - <1, (9, 0, 8)>
   - <1, (4, 0, 6)>

3. For `Node 2`:
   - <2, (7, 8, 3)>
   - <2, (7, 3, 8)>
   - <2, (7, 8, 2)>

4. For `Node 3`:
   - <3, (9, 7, 6)>
   - <3, (9, 7, 2)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 2)>

5. For `Node 4`:
   - <4, (7, 0, 6)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 0)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 6)>

6. For `Node 5`:
   - <5, (9, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (9, 8, 3)>
   - <5, (9, 6, 3)>

7. For `Node 6`:
   - <6, (5, 4, 3)>
   - <6, (5, 3, 0)>
   - <6, (5, 4, 0)>

8. For `Node 7`:
   - <7, (4, 3, 8)>
   - <7, (4, 8, 2)>
   - <7, (4, 3, 2)>

9. For `Node 8`:
   - <8, (5, 9, 7)>
   - <8, (5, 9, 2)>
   - <8, (5, 7, 2)>

10. For `Node 9`:
    - <9, (5, 8, 0)>
    - <9, (5, 0, 6)>
    - <9, (5, 8, 6)>

Let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
