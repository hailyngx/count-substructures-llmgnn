Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <3, (15, 19, 8)>
- <15, (3, 9, 6)>
- <4, (7, 13, 10)>
- <7, (4, 12, 6)>
- <8, (3, 13, 5)>
- <9, (15, 7, 2)>
- <12, (7, 8, 16)>
- <14, (4, 1, 14)>
- <16, (12, 0, 10)>
- <19, (3, 18, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets, is [10].
