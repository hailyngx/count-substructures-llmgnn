Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in this given graph:

<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<8, (6, 13, 2)>
<13, (8, 5, 11)>
<7, (11, 14, 5)>
<12, (9, 8, 14)>
<2, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (13, 7, 4)>
<1, (13, 12, 11)>
<0, (6, 9, 12)>
<10, (13, 2, 3)>

The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
