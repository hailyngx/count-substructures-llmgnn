Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph. To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 1 is connected to node 21, 2, and node 24
- Node 7 is connected to node 21, 4, 25, 27, and node 13
- Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 16, 11, and node 6
- Node 11 is connected to node 8, 28, 29, and node 15
- Node 13 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 0
- Node 14 is connected to node 26, 22, and node 9
- Node 15 is connected to node 11, 10, 26, and node 24
- Node 16 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 17
- Node 17 is connected to node 27, 26, and node 16
- Node 19 is connected to node 18, and node 0
- Node 20 is connected to node 25, 3, and node 24
- Node 21 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 26
- Node 22 is connected to node 28, 14, and node 6
- Node 23 is connected to node 27, 18, 3, and node 26
- Node 24 is connected to node 1, 20, 15, and node 9
- Node 25 is connected to node 7, 20, and node 29
- Node 26 is connected to node 21, 15, 14, 23, and node 17
- Node 27 is connected to node 7, 23, and node 17
- Node 28 is connected to node 11, and node 22
- Node 29 is connected to node 25, and node 11

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (21, 2, 24)>
2. <7, (21, 4, 25)>
3. <4, (7, 8, 0)>
4. <8, (4, 2, 16)>
5. <11, (8, 28, 29)>
6. <13, (7, 5, 0)>
7. <14, (26, 22, 9)>
8. <15, (11, 10, 26)>
9. <16, (8, 10, 17)>
10. <17, (27, 26, 16)>
11. <19, (18, 0, 0)>
12. <20, (25, 3, 24)>
13. <21, (1, 7, 26)>
14. <22, (28, 14, 6)>
15. <23, (27, 18, 3)>
16. <24, (1, 20, 15)>
17. <25, (7, 20, 29)>
18. <26, (21, 15, 14)>
19. <27, (7, 23, 17)>
20. <28, (11, 22, 6)>
21. <29, (25, 11, 11)>

We have found 21 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
