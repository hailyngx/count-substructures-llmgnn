Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

Given that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (14, 16, 19)>.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (11, 8, 15)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (10, 8, 13)>.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (14, 13, -)>.
- Node 8 does not participate in any 3-star.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (17, 19, -)>.
- Node 10 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (19, 4, 15)>.
- Node 12 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (17, 5, 7)>.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (17, 1, 7)>.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (11, 4, 2)>.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (17, 1, 0)>.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (14, 13, 16)>.
- Node 18 does not participate in any 3-star.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (1, 11, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (14, 16, 19)>, <4, (11, 8, 15)>, <5, (10, 8, 13)>, <7, (14, 13, -)>, <9, (17, 19, -)>, <11, (19, 4, 15)>, <13, (17, 5, 7)>, <14, (17, 1, 7)>, <15, (11, 4, 2)>, <17, (14, 13, 16)>.
