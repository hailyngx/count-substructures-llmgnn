Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will represent the centers of the 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (11, 4, 13)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (11, 7, 12)>
<3, (17, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (16, 14, 19)>
<6, (11, 1, 13)>
<7, (2, 12, 19)>
<10, (17, 12, 18)>
<11, (16, 0, 6)>
<12, (11, 10, 18)>
<13, (6, 9, 0)>
<14, (19, 5, 16)>
<15, (16, 5, 19)>
<16, (11, 15, 5)>
<17, (10, 3, 9)>
<18, (10, 12, 7)>
<19, (14, 7, 5)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
