Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The possible 3-stars can be found by looking at each node and identifying if it is the center of a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 3, 12)>
- <1, (4, 14, 12)>
- <2, (3, 6, 13)>
- <3, (9, 1, 10)>
- <4, (13, 10, 1)>
- <5, (6, 13, 14)>
- <6, (5, 14, 10)>
- <9, (8, 14, 3)>
- <10, (4, 3, 6)>
- <11, (1, 13, 2)>
- <12, (1, 13, 14)>
- <13, (5, 4, 12)>
- <14, (5, 9, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(13)].
