Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each set of three nodes where one of them is connected to the other two. 

- Starting with node 0: 
  - <0, (5, 9, 1)>  
  - <0, (5, 4, 8)>

- Moving on to node 1: 
  - <1, (6, 3, 0)>
  - <1, (6, 4, 7)>

- Next, considering node 2: 
  - <2, (9, 7, 3)>
  
- Looking at node 3: 
  - <3, (9, 6, 1)>
  - <3, (9, 2, 6)>

- Focusing on node 4: 
  - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (5, 0, 8)>

- Moving to node 5: 
  - No 3-stars as there are not three nodes connected through node 5.

- Considering node 6: 
  - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
  - <6, (9, 4, 8)>

- Moving on to node 7: 
  - <7, (1, 4, 2)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 8)>
  
- Focusing on node 8: 
  - <8, (6, 4, 7)>

- Last, considering node 9: 
  - <9, (6, 2, 3)>
  - <9, (6, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [11].
