Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

1. Look at the adjacency list for each node to identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 29, and 9
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 26 and 25
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 18, 9, and 11 (forming a 3-star <2, (18, 9, 11)>)
   - Node 3: Connected to node 29
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 18, 19, and 24 (forming a 3-star <4, (18, 19, 24)>)
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 14 and 24
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 7 and 20
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 0 and 6
   - Node 8: Connected to node 12
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 18, and 13
   - Node 10: Connected to nodes 26 and 4
   - Node 11: Connected to nodes 2 and 27
   - Node 12: Connected to nodes 16, 29, and 8
   - Node 13: Connected to nodes 15 and 9
   - Node 14: Connected to nodes 23, 28, and 25
   - Node 15: Connected to nodes 19, 13, and 16
   - Node 16: Connected to nodes 15, 12, and 24
   - Node 17: Connected to nodes 22, 18, and 20
   - Node 18: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9 (forming a 3-star <18, (2, 4, 9)>)
   - Node 19: Connected to nodes 23, 4, and 24 (forming a 3-star <19, (23, 4, 24)>)
   - Node 20: Connected to nodes 17 and 6
   - Node 21: Connected to nodes 19 and 24
   - Node 22: Connected to nodes 27 and 17
   - Node 23: Connected to nodes 26, 14, and 28
   - Node 24: Connected to nodes 4, 21, and 19 (forming a 3-star <24, (4, 21, 19)>)
   - Node 25: Connected to nodes 18, 1, and 14
   - Node 26: Connected to nodes 23, 1, and 10
   - Node 27: Connected to nodes 22 and 11
   - Node 28: Connected to nodes 23, 9, and 14
   - Node 29: Connected to nodes 0, 12, and 3

2. Count the total number of identified 3-stars:
   - Three 3-stars identified: <2, (18, 9, 11)>, <4, (18, 19, 24)>, <18, (2, 4, 9)>, <19, (23, 4, 24)>, <24, (4, 21, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
