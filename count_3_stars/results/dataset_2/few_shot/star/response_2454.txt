Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them first:

1. The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 10, and 5
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 14, 0, and 5
   - Node 13: Connected to nodes 8 and 0
   - Node 18: Connected to node 14

Now, let's analyze each of these nodes to identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 10, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 10, 6)>

2. For Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 14, 5)>
   - <7, (0, 14, 12)>

3. For Node 13:
   - <13, (0, 8, 6)>
   - <13, (0, 8, 1)>

4. For Node 18:
   - <18, (14, 7, 12)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
