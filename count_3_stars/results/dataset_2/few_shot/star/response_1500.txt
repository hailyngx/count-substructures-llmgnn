Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Once we identify these nodes, we can form 3-stars using these nodes as the center and their neighboring nodes as the leaves.

Here are the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2: Connected to node 0
- Node 12: Connected to node 10

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes separately:

For Node 2:
- <2, (0, x, x)>
- Only one possible 3-star can be formed with Node 2 at the center. 

For Node 12:
- <12, (10, x, x)>
- Only one possible 3-star can be formed with Node 12 at the center.

Since we found a total of two unique 3-stars, the final answer is [2].
