Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Possible 3-star centred at Node 0:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (9, 5, 4)>
<0, (9, 5, 0)>
[4 unique 3-star(s) centred at Node 0]

2. Possible 3-star centred at Node 1:
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
[1 unique 3-star(s) centred at Node 1]

3. Possible 3-star centred at Node 2:
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
[1 unique 3-star(s) centred at Node 2]

4. Possible 3-star centred at Node 3:
<3, (5, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<3, (7, 5, 4)>
[3 unique 3-star(s) centred at Node 3]

5. Possible 3-star centred at Node 4:
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
[2 unique 3-star(s) centred at Node 4]

6. Possible 3-star centred at Node 5:
[No possible 3-star centred at Node 5]

7. Possible 3-star centred at Node 6:
[No possible 3-star centred at Node 6]

8. Possible 3-star centred at Node 7:
[No possible 3-star centred at Node 7]

9. Possible 3-star centred at Node 8:
[No possible 3-star centred at Node 8]

10. Possible 3-star centred at Node 9:
[No possible 3-star centred at Node 9]

After identifying all possible 3-stars in the given graph, we count the total unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
