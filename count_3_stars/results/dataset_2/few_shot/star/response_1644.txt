Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes form 3-stars:
   - Node 4: (4, 7, 9)
   - Node 7: (7, 4, 12)
   - Node 14: (14, 6, 18)
   - Node 16: (16, 4, 14)

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Total number of unique 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 9, 16)>
<7, (4, 12, 17)>
<14, (6, 18, 16)>
<16, (4, 14, 2)>
