Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list all the potential 3-stars based on the given information:
1. Node 0: (17, 14, 7)
2. Node 0: (17, 14, 11)
3. Node 0: (7, 14, 11)
4. Node 4: (17, 8, 1)
5. Node 4: (17, 8, 6)
6. Node 7: (14, 16, 19)
7. Node 9: (18, 1, 13)
8. Node 15: (10, 16, 7)
9. Node 16: (15, 7, 5)
10. Node 18: (9, 1, 13)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars from the above list:  
[10]  
<0, (17, 14, 7)>  
<0, (17, 14, 11)>  
<0, (7, 14, 11)>  
<4, (17, 8, 1)>  
<4, (17, 8, 6)>  
<7, (14, 16, 19)>  
<9, (18, 1, 13)>  
<15, (10, 16, 7)>  
<16, (15, 7, 5)>  
<18, (9, 1, 13)>
