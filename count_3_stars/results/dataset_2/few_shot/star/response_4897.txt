Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has 3-stars <0, (5, 9, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 3)>, <0, (9, 1, 6)>.
- Node 1 has 3-stars <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 0, 6)>.
- Node 2 has 3-stars <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>.
- Node 3 has no 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3-stars <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>.
- Node 5 has 3-stars <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>.
- Node 6 has no 3-stars.
- Node 7 has no 3-stars.
- Node 8 has no 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3-stars <9, (8, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
