Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5)

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes 4 and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. Thus, we have two 3-stars:
    <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    <7, (4, 3, 2)>

2. There are no other nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
    <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    <7, (4, 3, 2)>
