Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes with 90 edges as described. Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

A 3-star is defined by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will look for all possible 3-stars in this graph.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

<3, (10, 22, 29)>
<6, (5, 13, 29)>
<7, (10, 14, 19)>
<9, (1, 25, 28)>
<12, (2, 19, 29)>
<16, (18, 21, 24)>
<18, (9, 16, 11)>
<19, (7, 8, 12)>
<21, (4, 16, 24)>
<26, (13, 17, 28)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
