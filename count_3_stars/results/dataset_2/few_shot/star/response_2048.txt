Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with the identified node as the center.

1. Identify nodes with exactly three connections:
   - Node 5 is connected to node 11 (1st connection)
   - Node 6 is connected to node 18 (1st connection) and node 16 (2nd connection)
   - Node 18 is connected to node 6 (1st connection)

2. Count the number of 3-star configurations where each of the identified nodes serves as the center:
   - Number of 3-stars with center at node 5: 0
   - Number of 3-stars with center at node 6: 1 (<6, (18, 16)>)
   - Number of 3-stars with center at node 18: 1 (<18, (6, 16)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
