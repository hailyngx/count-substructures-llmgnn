Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information.

Here are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors {6, 2, 9}
- Node 2 has neighbors {4, 3, 6}
- Node 5 has neighbors {4, 7, 6}
- Node 8 has neighbors {4, 7, 3}

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
