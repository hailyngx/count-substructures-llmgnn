Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <1, (11, 14, 7)>
3. Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 4 neighbors instead of 3.
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 neighbors instead of 3.
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 4 neighbors instead of 3.
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (6, 2, 14)>
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 4 neighbors instead of 3.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 4 neighbors instead of 3.
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 3 neighbors instead of 4.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 4 neighbors instead of 3.
11. Node 10 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 3 neighbors instead of 4.
12. Node 11 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 5 neighbors instead of 3.
13. Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <12, (9, 8, 13)>
14. Node 13 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 neighbors instead of 3.
15. Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <14, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (11, 14, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 14)>, and <12, (9, 8, 13)>.
