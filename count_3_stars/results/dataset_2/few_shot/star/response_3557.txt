Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's list down the possible 3-star patterns based on the given adjacency list:
- (2, 6, 27)
- (3, 5, 29)
- (4, 7, 27)
- (9, 6, 10)
- (13, 10, 29)
- (17, 1, 28)
- (18, 12, 28)
- (22, 16, 24)
- (25, 0, 16)
- (28, 8, 21)

Now, let's count the occurrences of each unique 3-star pattern in the graph:

- (2, 6, 27): 1
- (3, 5, 29): 1
- (4, 7, 27): 1
- (9, 6, 10): 1
- (13, 10, 29): 1
- (17, 1, 28): 1
- (18, 12, 28): 1
- (22, 16, 24): 1
- (25, 0, 16): 1
- (28, 8, 21): 1

Finally, we obtain the count of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [10].

So, the answer is [10].
  
List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, 6, 27>
- <3, 5, 29>
- <4, 7, 27>
- <9, 6, 10>
- <13, 10, 29>
- <17, 1, 28>
- <18, 12, 28>
- <22, 16, 24>
- <25, 0, 16>
- <28, 8, 21>
