Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's consider each node as the center of the 3-star and identify the leaves connected to it. 

For Node 0:
- <0, (3, 6, 5)>
- <0, (3, 5, 2)>

For Node 1:
- <1, (7, 3, 5)>
- <1, (7, 5, 9)>
- <1, (7, 9, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 0)>
- <2, (4, 6, 5)>
- <2, (3, 6, 0)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (1, 0, 2)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>

For Node 4:
- <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- <4, (7, 2, 9)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 0, 2)>
- <5, (6, 2, 0)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (5, 2, 0)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (4, 1, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 2)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (4, 9, 1)>
- <8, (4, 1, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 2)>
- <8, (4, 7, 5)>
- <8, (9, 1, 5)>

For Node 9:
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of 17 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
