Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Starting with each node as the center of the star, check if it has exactly three neighbors. If yes, record it as a 3-star.
2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 11, 19)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<3, (9, 15, 2)>
<15, (3, 18, 17)>
<4, (9, 8, 12)>
<8, (4, 19, 0)>
<2, (3, 10, 17)>
<0, (8, 1, 19)>
<7, (6, 13, 17)>
<16, (12)>
<12, (3, 4, 16)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars gives us a final answer of [11].
