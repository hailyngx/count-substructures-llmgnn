Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the steps:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
    - Node 0 has edges with nodes 8, 4, and 6
    - Node 1 has edges with nodes 9, 7, and 13
    - Node 5 has an edge with node 4
    - Node 11 has an edge with node 4

2. Now, for each of these identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their connected nodes.

    For Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 6
    - So, the 3-star is <0, (8, 4, 6)>

    For Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 13
    - So, the 3-star is <1, (9, 7, 13)>

    For Node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to node 4
    - This is not a valid 3-star as it requires three nodes connected to Node 5.

    For Node 11:
    - Node 11 is connected to node 4
    - This is not a valid 3-star as it requires three nodes connected to Node 11.

3. Finally, count the number of valid 3-stars found: [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (8, 4, 6)> and <1, (9, 7, 13)>.
