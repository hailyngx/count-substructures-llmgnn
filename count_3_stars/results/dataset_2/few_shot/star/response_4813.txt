Response:
First, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph. To do this, we need to identify all the 3-stars.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star must have a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We'll now examine each node to find all possible 3-stars.

- Node 0: No 3-stars as it has connections to 5 nodes.
- Node 1: 1 possible 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 19. <1, (5, 10, 19)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it has connections to 2 nodes.
- Node 3: 2 possible 3-stars, <3, (5, 7, 10)> and <3, (12, 13, 15)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it has connections to 1 node.
- Node 5: 2 possible 3-stars, <5, (0, 1, 19)> and <5, (3, 7, 19)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it has connections to 1 node.
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it has connections to 2 nodes.
- Node 8: 1 possible 3-star with nodes 14, 16, and 17. <8, (14, 16, 17)>
- Node 9: 1 possible 3-star with nodes 11, 16, and 19. <9, (11, 16, 19)>
- Node 10: No 3-stars as it has connections to 3 nodes.
- Node 11: 1 possible 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 18. <11, (0, 9, 18)>
- Node 12: No 3-stars as it has connections to 4 nodes.
- Node 13: No 3-stars as it has connections to 3 nodes.
- Node 14: No 3-stars as it has connections to 3 nodes.
- Node 15: No 3-stars as it has connections to 1 node.
- Node 16: 2 possible 3-stars, <16, (4, 8, 14)> and <16, (8, 9, 14)>
- Node 17: No 3-stars as it has connections to 4 nodes.
- Node 18: No 3-stars as it has connections to 2 nodes.
- Node 19: No 3-stars as it has connections to 3 nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 2 (from node 3) + 2 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) + 1 (from node 11) + 2 (from node 16) = 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 10, 19)>, <3, (5, 7, 10)>, <3, (12, 13, 15)>, <5, (0, 1, 19)>, <5, (3, 7, 19)>, <8, (14, 16, 17)>, <9, (11, 16, 19)>, <11, (0, 9, 18)>, <16, (4, 8, 14)>, <16, (8, 9, 14)>
