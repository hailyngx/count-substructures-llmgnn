Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (12, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 14, 10, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 10, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 0, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 14, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, 10, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 14, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 13, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, 6, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 11, and node 13

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 12, 0)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<7, (4, 14, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 0)>
<10, (5, 1, 2)>
<11, (3, 14, 13)>
<8, (7, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 0, 13)>
<2, (4, 7, 10)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph by counting the unique 3-stars listed above. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [10]
