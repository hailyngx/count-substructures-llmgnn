Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 2, 10, 3, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 13
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 6, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 10, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 13, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 14, and node 10
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 12, 3, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 0, 6, 13, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 10, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-star patterns:

<0, (7, 2, 10)>
<0, (7, 3, 11)>
<2, (4, 6, 14)>
<3, (5, 9, 10)>
<4, (7, 9, 11)>
<5, (4, 6, 14)>
<6, (2, 5, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 8)>
<8, (7, 12, 14)>
<9, (4, 3, 11)>
<10, (6, 13, 3)>
<11, (4, 0, 9)>
<12, (7, 10, 8)>
<13, (1, 5, 10)>
<14, (2, 6, 8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 14. So, the answer is [14].
