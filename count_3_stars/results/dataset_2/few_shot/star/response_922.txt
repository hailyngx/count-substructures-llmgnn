Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 14, 13, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 14, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 14, 12, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 9, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 11, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 13, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 10, and node 11
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 2, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 6, 8, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 13, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 3, 11, 0, 12, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 10, 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (14, 9, 8)>
<2, (7, 14, 9)>
<3, (13, 0, 9)>
<4, No 3-stars>
<5, (11, 6, 0)>
<6, (11, 10, 5)>
<7, (2, 13, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 10)>
<9, No 3-stars>
<10, (11, 8, 14)>
<11, (13, 8, 5)>
<12, No 3-stars>
<13, (11, 9, 0)>
<14, No 3-stars>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
