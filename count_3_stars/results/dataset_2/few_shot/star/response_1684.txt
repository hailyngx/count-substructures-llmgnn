Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (4, 7, 10)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 10, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 11)>
<4, (8, 0, 10)>
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (12, 0, 14)>
<8, (4, 10, 2)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<10, (9, 4, 0)>
<11, (9, 4, 3)>
<12, (9, 7, 6)>
<13, (5, 7, 6)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13.]
