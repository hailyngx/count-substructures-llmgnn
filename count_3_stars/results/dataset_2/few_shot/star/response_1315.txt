Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (17, 18, 14)>
<1, (4, 14, 11)>
<2, (4, 3, 11)>
<3, (17, 2, 16)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 1, -)>
<6, (8, 13, -)>
<7, (4, 12, 15)>
<8, (18, 6, -)>
<9, (0, 13, -)>
<10, (15, 16, -)>
<11, (2, 1, -)>
<12, (7, 14, -)>
<13, (14, 3, 6)>
<14, (12, 0, 1)>
<15, (7, 10, -)>
<16, (10, 3, -)>
<17, (3, 0, 19)>
<18, (7, 0, 8)>
<19, (7, 17, 15)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can count how many unique 3-stars there are in the graph. 
There are a total of [19] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
