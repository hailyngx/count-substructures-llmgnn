Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three adjacent nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 6, 4)> and <0, (9, 4, 7)> are 3-stars.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 9, 4)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
5. Node 4: No unique 3-stars with Node 4 as the center.
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)> and <5, (9, 7, 4)> are 3-stars.
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 4)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
9. Node 8: No unique 3-stars with Node 8 as the center.
10. Node 9: No unique 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 6, 4)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, and <6, (9, 1, 4)>.
