Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a total of 30 nodes in the graph. To calculate the number of 3-stars, we need to find the nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (21, 4, 27)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 23)>
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (29, 13, 17)>
4. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (27, 5, 24)>
5. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (11, 1, 10)>
6. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (21, 3, 16)>
7. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (10, 0, 18)>
8. Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (2, 27, 23)>
9. Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (29, 12, 21)>
10. Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (27, 19, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
