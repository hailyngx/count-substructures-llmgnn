Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can identify which nodes are connected as a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the following possible 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (27, 28, 4)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 28)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 20, 14)>
- Node 3: <3, (27, 22, 12)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 17, 24)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 26, 17)>
- Node 6: <6, (8, 15, 23)>
- Node 7: <7, (21, 2, 1)>
- Node 8: <8, (10, 6, None)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 19, 12)>
- Node 10: <10, (5, 21, 8)>
- Node 12: <12, (9, 13, 24)>
- Node 14: <14, (22, 2, None)>
- Node 17: <17, (5, 29, 18)>
- Node 18: <18, (21, 25, 17)>
- Node 19: <19, (9, 22, None)>
- Node 20: <20, (25, 2, None)>
- Node 21: <21, (7, 10, 13)>
- Node 22: <22, (27, 26, 19)>
- Node 24: <24, (25, 12, 4)>
- Node 25: <25, (11, 20, 28)>
- Node 26: <26, (5, 27, 22)>
- Node 27: <27, (0, 22, 3)>
- Node 28: <28, (0, 25, 1)>
- Node 29: <29, (21, 17, None)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
