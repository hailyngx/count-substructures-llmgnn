Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

- From Node 0: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- From Node 1: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 3 nodes.
- From Node 2: <2, (6, 11, 18)>
- From Node 3: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- From Node 4: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- From Node 5: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- From Node 6: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 3 nodes.
- From Node 7: <7, (10, 13, 8)>
- From Node 8: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 3 nodes.
- From Node 9: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 3 nodes.
- From Node 10: <10, (17, 14, 7)>
- From Node 11: <11, (17, 18, 2)>
- From Node 12: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 3 nodes.
- From Node 13: No 3-stars since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- From Node 14: No 3-stars since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- From Node 15: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- From Node 16: No 3-stars since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- From Node 17: No 3-stars since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- From Node 18: No 3-stars since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- From Node 19: No 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (6, 11, 18)>
<7, (10, 13, 8)>
<10, (17, 14, 7)>
<11, (17, 18, 2)>
