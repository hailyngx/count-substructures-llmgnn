Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and see if it has the appropriate connections to form a 3-star. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. 

Analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, _)>  (Incomplete star, can't form a complete 3-star)
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
