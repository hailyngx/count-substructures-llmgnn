Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify all the 3-stars in this graph.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows: 

- <0, (9, 7, 13)>
- <1, (6, 11, 2)>
- <2, (6, 5, 14)>
- <3, (4, 8, 14)>
- <4, (7, 8, 12)>
- <5, (6, 13, 2)>
- <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- <7, (4, 12, 0)>
- <8, (9, 4, 3)>
- <9, (6, 8, 13)>
- <10, (12, 0, 14)>
- <11, (4, 1, 14)>
- <12, (9, 4, 7)>
- <13, (9, 7, 5)>
- <14, (6, 10, 11)>

There are no repeated 3-stars, and there is not a unique 3-star that has not been listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
