Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star configuration). Given the graph information provided, let's find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 1, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 8, 5), (1, 4, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 3)
4. Node 3: (3, 9, 8), (3, 4, 0), (3, 2, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 7, 0), (4, 1, 0), (4, 6, 2)
6. Node 5: (5, 8, 1), (5, 2, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 9, 4), (6, 4, 0), (6, 2, 3)
8. Node 7: (7, 9, 4)
9. Node 8: (8, 5, 1), (8, 9, 3)
10. Node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 8, 3), (9, 7, 4)

These are all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of 18 3-stars: 

[18]

<0, (4, 6, 1)>, <1, (8, 5, 4)>, <2, (4, 6, 5)>, <3, (9, 8, 4)>, <3, (4, 0, 2)>, <3, (2, 5, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 6)>, <4, (1, 0, 6)>, <4, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (4, 0, 2)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4)>, <8, (5, 1, 4)>, <8, (9, 3, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 9)>
