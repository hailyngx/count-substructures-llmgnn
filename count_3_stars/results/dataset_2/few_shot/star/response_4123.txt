Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we can identify the 3-star graphs by examining each node and its connections:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 1, so it forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 2, 8, and 1 as the leaves. <5, (2, 8, 1)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 4, so it forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 7, and 4 as the leaves. <1, (5, 7, 4)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 9, so it forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 5, 0, and 9 as the leaves. <3, (5, 0, 9)>
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9, so it forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 5, 6, and 9 as the leaves. <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
