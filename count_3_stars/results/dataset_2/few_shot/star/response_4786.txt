Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of a 3-star. Then, we identify the three nodes connected to each center node to form the 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

[7] 

Count of 3-stars: [1]

Explanation:
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
