Response:
We can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 15, 28)>
2. <1, (13, 25, 8)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 27)>
4. <3, (16, 23, 0)>
5. <4, (6, 11, 27)>
6. <5, (2, 12, 25)>
7. <6, (4, 19, 22)>
8. <7, (9, 24, 25)>
9. <8, (11, 12, 25)>
10. <9, (7, 24, 25)>
11. <10, (16, 17, 20)>
12. <11, (4, 8, 27)>
13. <12, (8, 20, 23)>
14. <13, (1, 25, 13)>
15. <14, (18, 15, 17)>
16. <15, (0, 18, 27)>
17. <16, (3, 10, 26)>
