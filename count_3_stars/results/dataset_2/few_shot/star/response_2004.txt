Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-star structures with that node as the center.

Nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: (4, 2, 7)
- Node 1: (9, 5, 7)
- Node 2: (6, 8, 3, 0)
- Node 3: (6, 4, 5, 2, 7)
- Node 4: (9, 8, 0, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (6, 4, 1, 3)
- Node 6: (9, 5, 3, 2)
- Node 7: (9, 8, 0, 3, 1)
- Node 8: (4, 2, 7)
- Node 9: (6, 4, 1, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 5, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<3, (6, 4, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
