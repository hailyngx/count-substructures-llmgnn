Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14)

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 13, forming a 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 7, 8, and 13 as leaves. This is represented as <4, (7, 8, 13)>.

- Similarly, we can identify another 3-star:
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 6, forming a 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 7, 3, and 6 as leaves. This is represented as <4, (7, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
