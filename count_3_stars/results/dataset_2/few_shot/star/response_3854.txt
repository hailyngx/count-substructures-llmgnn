Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's observe the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, and 13 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot be the centers of 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 7, and 10 have exactly 5 neighbors, so they cannot be the centers of 3-stars.
- Nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9 have exactly 6 neighbors.

Next, let's check the possible 3-stars around nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9 by looking at their neighbors:
1. Node 3:
   - (3, 11, 12, 14) forms a 3-star.
   - (3, 11, 2) forms a 3-star.

2. Node 5:
   - (5, 9, 13) forms a 3-star.
   - (5, 9, 6) forms a 3-star.
   - (5, 13, 2) forms a 3-star.

3. Node 8:
   - (8, 6, 0) forms a 3-star.
   - (8, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.
   - (8, 3, 10) forms a 3-star.
   - (8, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.

4. Node 9:
   - (9, 10, 1) forms a 3-star.
   - (9, 10, 8) forms a 3-star.
   - (9, 10, 0) forms a 3-star.
   - (9, 13, 2) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (11, 12, 14)>
<3, (11, 2)>
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<5, (9, 6)>
<8, (6, 0)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<8, (3, 10)>
<8, (4, 5)>
<9, (10, 1)>
<9, (10, 8)>
<9, (10, 0)>
<9, (13, 2)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
