Response:
To count the number of 3-star patterns, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars.

Below are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (6, 15, 3)>
<1, (8, 16, 19)>
<2, (10)>
<3, (18, 0)>
<4, (9, 12, 5)>
<5, (17, 4, 11)>
<6, (9, 17, 0)>
<7, (10, 12, 19)>
<8, (7, 19, 15)>
<9, (6, 4, 17)>
<10, (7, 2)>
<11, (12, 4, 5)>
<12, (7, 4, 11)>
<13, (18, 14)>
<14, (15, 13)>
<15, (8, 19, 0)>
<16, (17, 18, 1)>
<17, (6, 9, 16)>
<18, (16, 3, 13)>
<19, (7, 8, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
