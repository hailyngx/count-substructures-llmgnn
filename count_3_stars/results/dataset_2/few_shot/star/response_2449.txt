Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

Possible 3-star configurations:
<1, (17, 3, 18)>
<2, (16, 12, 17)>
<3, (17, 0, 5)>
<4, (13, 2, 12)>
<5, (3, 5, 10)>
<6, (8, 6, 14)>
<7, (7, 15, 19)>
<8, (14, 6, 10)>
<9, (16, 9, 14)>
<10, (10, 8, 6)>
<11, (11, 2, 4)>
<12, (12, 2, 13)>
<13, (13, 0, 4)>
<14, (14, 8, 9)>
<15, (15, 13, 18)>
<16, (16, 2, 17)>
<17, (17, 1, 3)>
<18, (18, 1, 15)>
<19, (19, 7, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19], as there are 19 unique 3-star configurations present in the given graph.
