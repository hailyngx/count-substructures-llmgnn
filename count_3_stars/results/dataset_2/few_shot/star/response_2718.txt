Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star configuration around a central node. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 14)>
<1, (3, 10, 6)>
<2, (8, 10, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<5, (3, 0, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 12)>
<7, (4, 0, 14)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 11, 12)>
<10, (6, 1, 3)>
<11, (9, 0, 5)>
<12, (6, 8, 9)>
<13, (4, 2, 5)>
<14, (3, 7, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
