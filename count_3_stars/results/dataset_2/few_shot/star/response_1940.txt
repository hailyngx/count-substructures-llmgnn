Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we check the nodes connected to each center node to find the 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 5, 8, 12.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars centered at these nodes:
- Center at node 5: (5, 7, 14), so we have <5, (7, 14)>
- Center at node 8: (8, 14, 1), so we have <8, (14, 1)>
- Center at node 12: (12, 14, 0), so we have <12, (14, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (7, 14)>, <8, (14, 1)>, and <12, (14, 0)>.
