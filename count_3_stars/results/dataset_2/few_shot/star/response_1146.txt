Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node.
- We are looking for 3-stars which consist of a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- Given that our graph has 20 nodes, we need to go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly 3 other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (12, 14, 2)>
<1, (10, 2, 13)>
<2, (17, 6, 14)>
<3, (12, 16, 0)>
<4, (10, 5, 16)>
<5, (19, 11, 4)>
<6, (2, 17, 11)>
<7, (10, 8, 16)>
<8, (7, 11, 10)>
<9, (7, 12, 16)>
<11, (19, 5, 8)>
<12, (0, 14, 3)>
<13, (1, 2, 7)>
<14, (0, 15, 2)>
<16, (3, 4, 7)>
<17, (2, 8, 6)>
<18, (19, 5, 11)>
<19, (11, 18, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
