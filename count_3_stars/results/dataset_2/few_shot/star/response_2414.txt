Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
   - Node 9 (neighbors: 23, 15, 19)
   - Node 26 (neighbors: 27, 27, 27)
   - Node 28 (neighbors: 11, 11, 19)

The node 26 does not form a valid 3-star as it is connected to the same node (27) three times.

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (23, 15, 19)>
<28, (11, 11, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
