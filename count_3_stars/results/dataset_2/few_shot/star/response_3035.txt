Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon identifying all the 3-stars, count how many unique 3-stars are present in the graph.

2. Output the final count inside brackets [] and list the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once.

Let's begin by identifying the 3-stars:

From the provided adjacency list and edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (6, 11, 2)>
<3, (9, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 12, 5)>
<10, (2, 5, 7)>
<12, (8, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the answer is [5].
